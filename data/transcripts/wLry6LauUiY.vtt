crimes um I am pleased to
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
uh introduce this bill um to your to the
 
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
body I know that you have heard similar
 
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
legislation this was uh entered in uh
 
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
passed by the uh Senate Judiciary
 
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 align:start position:0%
Committee and on and the Senate um in
 
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
the full Senate of course and is on its
 
00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
way to you um we know that New Hampshire
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
is a very safe place to live we hear
 
00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 align:start position:0%
that often um and we're all very
 
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
grateful for that but we also know that
 
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire like much of the country
 
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
uh may be experiencing an uptick in bias
 
00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
related crimes or hate crime bias
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
motivated crimes or hate crimes um this
 
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
is this bill is a way to collect that
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
data and understand what it means and
 
00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
how to use it of course that's the point
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
of collecting any data is to make sure
 
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
that we can then allocate resources in
 
00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
an appropriate way um right now uh the
 
00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
so and I should step back and mention
 
00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 align:start position:0%
that the bill you have in front of you
 
00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 align:start position:0%
really is a collaboration it it comes
 
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
from the work that was done um with the
 
00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 align:start position:0%
AG's office the uh State Department of
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
Safety State Police and uh some work
 
00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 align:start position:0%
with the ACLU and some work with a a
 
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
variety of stakeholders who have
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
interest in this issue so I think it's
 
00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
very important that we make sure that
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
we're collecting it and we're doing it
 
00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
in a timely fashion that is one of the
 
00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:06.879 align:start position:0%
things that's so interesting when we
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
think about um collection of data is it
 
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
isn't useful if it's old it's better if
 
00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
we can collect it in a timely fashion so
 
00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 align:start position:0%
let me just mention that this would um
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
require that law enforcement agencies
 
00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:26.759 align:start position:0%
report bias motivated crimes hate crimes
 
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Safety so that it
 
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
can then then be made available on its
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
website uh currently the department of
 
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
safety has a very good website some of
 
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
it more usable than others but um there
 
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
is what is called the theme oriented
 
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
public site uh right now the theme
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
oriented public site includes uh
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
statistics on drug use and DUI violent
 
00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:56.759 align:start position:0%
crime and property crime but they are
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
planning soon to um add three more
 
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
themes and that would be sexual assault
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and bias related
 
00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:08.919 align:start position:0%
crimes so in order to um have this uh
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
website up and running and be effective
 
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure the data is being
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
collected and reported in a timely
 
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
fashion and that is in fact what SB 315
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Senator um is there
 
00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
a definition and statute what what a
 
00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
bias crime is yes
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
gonna okay um so in at the bottom of
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
3:15 you will see that it mentions um
 
00:08:52.509 --> 00:08:52.519 align:start position:0%
protected characteristics identified in
 
00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
either RSA 354 B1 or RSA 651 colon 6 uh
 
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
r Roman 1 F and in that case um in
 
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
says conduct is motivated by race color
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
51 colon
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
6 uh Roman 1
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
F uh substantially motivated to commit
 
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
the crime because of hostility toward
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
the victims religion race Creed sexual

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
further definitions thank you and as far
 
00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
as who DET the officer investigating the
 
00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
crime would be the one who would make
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
that determination
 
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
yes and that's a really good question um
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
that is determined I believe the FBI
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
definition and I'm paraphrasing so um
 
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
and that is part what um defines this is
 
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
uh through objective measures and educ
 
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
an investigation a reasonable and
 
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
prudent person would believe it to be
 
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
so further questions representative um
 
00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:49.430 align:start position:0%
so further questions representative um
new

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.389 align:start position:0%
 
a

00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:54.519 align:start position:0%
little um it kind of gives a little bit
 
00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
of to understand uh any type of emerging
 
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
Trends and things like that uh we end up
 
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:13.310 align:start position:0%
Trends and things like that uh we end up
trying

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
tot yes absolutely would be a way of
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
understanding the trends and a variety
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
of information would be posted on the
 
00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:23.959 align:start position:0%
website including clearance of cases and
 
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
disposition um and I I appreciate you
 
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
bringing up um
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
at least it I believe it was yesterday
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
um representative selig uh introduced to
 
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee uh her bill
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
regarding um a study committee on
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
restorative restorative justice and uh
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
bias crimes and I think
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
that that the study committee is going
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
to need to be looking at data and these
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
are the kinds of data that we can use to
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
know whether is it a problem is it an
 
00:11:59.949 --> 00:11:59.959 align:start position:0%
increasing problem is is it a problem we
 
00:12:03.069 --> 00:12:03.079 align:start position:0%
need to identify and how best can we
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
identify you're
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
sik thank you and thank you senator for
 
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so in the language
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
um line three it references law
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies and then it
 
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
continues to talk about the law
 
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies will make the
 
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
report um don't is the my understanding
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
is the prosecutor for that area as part
 
00:12:27.069 --> 00:12:27.079 align:start position:0%
of the law enforcement agency or is that
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
different um in terms of who's like
 
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
would it could I guess my question is
 
00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
really would it could it be the
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
prosecutor who ultimately helps make the
 
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
determination with the police dep
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
Department about whether it's a hate
 
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
motivated crime versus just a crime of
 
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
passion or something I would imagine I
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
would imagine so but I I think we could
 
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
question see no further questions thank
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
you for your thank you very much for
 
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
which thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee um I'm here
 
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the American civil
 
00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:18.279 align:start position:0%

my name is Henry Clement toit I'm a
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
senior staff attorney we are in support
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
of this legislation as the prime sponsor
 
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
said it would help gather the data
 
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
necessary to figure out the extent to
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
which this is a problem how it's
 
00:13:33.069 --> 00:13:33.079 align:start position:0%
changing where in the state these things
 
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
are happening um and mostly I just
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to commend the good work of
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
Senator Chanley the Attorney General's
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
office and the state police for all of
 
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
their efforts on this um I urge the
 
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
committee to give this favorable
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
consideration happy to take any
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:59.470 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
testimony

00:13:59.470 --> 00:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
the chair calls um Victor Muzzy from the
 
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:09.230 align:start position:0%
the chair calls um Victor Muzzy from the
state

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
police thank you Mr chairman and members
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Victor Muzzy
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
um Captain in the State Police that
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
oversees the criminal records unit and
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
part of that is the UCR subunit within
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
the criminal records unit um just to
 
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
clarify as the senator said we do have
 
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
our own State Police website in addition
 
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
to that we have the Topps website which
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
is a thirdparty
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
hosted website that we utilize to report
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
crime data and statistics so
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
historically that has consisted of I'll
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
call it two areas one area that's kind
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
of geared towards crime analysts and a
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
lot of intricate information that's not
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
really um I can't say user friendly it
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
is to the audience that it's intended
 
00:14:50.829 --> 00:14:50.839 align:start position:0%
for but it's it's it's kind of deep
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
stuff and you got to dig around a lot to
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
to to understand what you're looking at
 
00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
and so this this Topps website as we
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
refer to it is sort of a more user
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
friendly public site it that will more
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
readily display information in a way
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
that's easily more easily digestible and
 
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
so pursuant to what the the senator said
 
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
we do have um a project on uh the plate
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
right now to expand that by three
 
00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
additional themes giving us a total of
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
six as the senator had had said so I
 
00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:17.959 align:start position:0%
think it's important to note a couple of
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
things a um we are collecting this data
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
right now U it's on a yearly basis not
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
on a six-month basis um and and that's
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
part of the current UCR program that we
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
currently report up to the feds on the
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
digestability of the way we present that
 
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
probably could could stand to to use
 
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
some um polishing I'll say and that's
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
what we intend to do with this project
 
00:15:41.069 --> 00:15:41.079 align:start position:0%
so um I think Senator you are correct
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
and I think the definition um as it's
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
been laid before us because there's some
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
question right is it about a conviction
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
is it where where do we make the
 
00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
determination that a hate crime is
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
considered that and so it made sense to
 
00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:54.519 align:start position:0%
me to reference what the FBI uses for
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
that definition just so there's
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
consistency and I think we've captured
 
00:15:59.309 --> 00:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
that in the bill here um which is
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
basically you know the officer or
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
someone of of um reasonable
 
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
determination to say this seems to be
 
00:16:08.309 --> 00:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
motivated by by a bias uh just to keep
 
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
everything consistent so that that all
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
made sense to me so just to clarify for
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
the members we are collecting it um
 
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
again and making that available not in
 
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
probably the most easily digestible way
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
but we're we're working on that um and
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
again this bill I think makes it um more
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
readily available in a in a in a more
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
timely F you know manner or fashion I
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
suppose which is probably a good thing
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
for this purpose so my intent really as
 
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
I think it is right now is to have a
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
link on our website that points to that
 
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
tops website um so that people you know
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
know where to go and I think that will
 
00:16:42.269 --> 00:16:42.279 align:start position:0%
satisfy the the bill and will be easy
 
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
for us to to implement as we've already
 
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
done with the other three themes so um I
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
think that's all I have to add this
 
00:16:50.189 --> 00:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
morning so thank you for your time and
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions thank you
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
Captain so on a yearly basis now you
 
00:16:59.309 --> 00:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
report up to the feds correct
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
but do you update your data as it in
 
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:04.839 align:start position:0%
real time as it comes in and then you
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
just transmit that to the feds once a
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
year yeah well I I I think um we
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
actually do it on a monthly basis um but
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
we have a statute a state statute that
 
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:19.720 align:start position:0%
allows us um I believe until April 1st
 
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
the year following to make sure that
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
those statistics are finalized I suppose
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
so um we do tend to do it on a monthly
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
basis that es and flows a little bit
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
some agencies a little bit more
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
difficult to get their you know their
 
00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:34.919 align:start position:0%
data and information compiled um but
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
it's the intent to do that you know not
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
once a year but 12 times a year or as
 
00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:41.799 align:start position:0%
close there too um and and get it
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
uploaded so I guess the the that was
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
just a foundational question the the six
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
months won't be a problem then as far as
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
Staffing you're getting that in there in
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
time yeah I don't I don't believe it
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
will really it's just obviously written
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
down that we should we should be doing
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
it more frequently so it will just put
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
emphasis on the local Department
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
departments and ours including ours of
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
course it's it's twofold for us right we
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
we create some of the statistics but
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
we're also responsible for it in the
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
State Police so I think it just puts
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
more emphasis on on getting those things
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
um finalized sooner and
 
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
reported okay and back to the um
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
determination piece of
 
00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
this the officer doing the
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
investigation would check off whether he
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
feels or she feels this is in a
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable determination that this is a
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
biased crime
 
00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:32.919 align:start position:0%
um and that's done there was a question
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
earlier whether that could be done by
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
the um by the prosecutor or not that's
 
00:18:39.789 --> 00:18:39.799 align:start position:0%
done in the field right that's not done
 
00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
in the court because you could actually
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
bring an enhanced charge for that
 
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
correct that's really what happens is it
 
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
might be the crime of criminal mischief
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
um but there's an enhanced penalty if
 
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
it's you know bias motivated and so that
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's how it works so I suppose to
 
00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:56.919 align:start position:0%
answer that question to the best of my
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
knowledge it certainly could be the
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
prosecutor looking at the facts and
 
00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances in the case and making a
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
determination about charging that as a
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
bias motivated crime or that it may
 
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
qualify now as everyone probably is
 
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
aware they could make the determination
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
that although they feel that they can't
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
prove that so they don't charge it that
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
way but that doesn't mean for this
 
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
purpose in my mind that it still should
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
be reported as a as a bias motivated
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
crime there may be some hindrance to
 
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
them successfully Prosecuting it as such
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
but in my mind the agency whether that
 
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
involves their prosecutor or their their
 
00:19:30.909 --> 00:19:30.919 align:start position:0%
Command Staff or whatever you know may
 
00:19:32.669 --> 00:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
be should be the ones responsible
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately as a team to determine
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not it it meets the standard
 
00:19:38.149 --> 00:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
and and should be reported as such so is
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
the is the data though that you report
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
is it clear that whether or not a a
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
charge was actually brought and whether
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
or not it was Pro uh successfully
 
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
prosecuted or it's not at the moment so
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
we would have to consider how to I guess
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
adequately capture that between us and
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
the court um obviously we we we we share
 
00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.270 align:start position:0%
the court um obviously we we we we share
data

00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
um back and forth with the court now so
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's that would be an
 
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
additional couple of steps I guess at
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
the moment our reporting obligation
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
based upon the federal definition and
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
guidelines is once that box is checked
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
so to speak and the determination has
 
00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:14.919 align:start position:0%
been made at the agency level that it's
 
00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
a bias motivated crime that's it that's
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
where it stops we just that
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
determination has been made it gets
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
reported that way and there is no real
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
follow through to determine was it
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
charged that way was there a conviction
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
um under that so that would be I guess
 
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
some additional reporting considerations
 
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
and some communication that would have
 
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
to be ironed out in order to do this
 
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
effectively um I see what the intent
 
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
here is but it's it seems to me the
 
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
value of the information gets called
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
into question if if an initial
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
determination is made bias and for
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
example when the person goes to a jury
 
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
trial it's found not guilty well then
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
there was no bias crime because he was
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
not guilty so therefore the information
 
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
skewed and at the local level we want
 
00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
accurate because we could use it for all
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
sorts of purposes funding targeted
 
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
policing things like that nature so um I
 
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
wonder if there's a a way to add a box
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
or or that's going to take you going
 
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
back I mean don't you already follow the
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
cases through to the end at least as far
 
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
as your prosecutions
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
and well we do I mean the state police
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
does for our own certainly you know what
 
00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:18.039 align:start position:0%
I mean not not the locals obviously
 
00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
but you know what what I might see
 
00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
happening is you know the court in their
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
sentencing or in their finding may have
 
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
to check their box to say you know what
 
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be so that we can close
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
that Loop a little more effectively
 
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
so that's something to consider you know
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
and again I think the purpose here is to
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
determine at the at the street level
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
I'll say you know was this bias
 
00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
motivated now a thousand things can
 
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
happen between investigation and
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
successful prosecution which can change
 
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
the data or change the way that the data
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
turns out and you know as as I
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
understand it and see it it really
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter I mean it does matter
 
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
what the outcome is because we want to
 
00:21:54.909 --> 00:21:54.919 align:start position:0%
know people are being held accountable
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
to a certain standard
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
but from an in in instance standpoint
 
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
you know really what we want to know is
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
how many of these things are
 
00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:06.919 align:start position:0%
occurring um in order to how to you know
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
adequately address them the outcome is
 
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.630 align:start position:0%
adequately address them the outcome is
is

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
important but then we get into what are
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
we really grading here are we grading a
 
00:22:17.549 --> 00:22:17.559 align:start position:0%
successful prosecution are we trying to
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
determine um how things change over the
 
00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
course of that prosecution or really
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
just looking at is this stuff occurring
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
where is it occurring and what do we
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
feel might be a reasonable outcome um
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
whether that's restorative justice or
 
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
some other process to reduce it I mean
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's I know I'm adding a bunch of
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
layers of complexity the issue I'm just
 
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
trying to I'm trying to get to the value
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
of the information and the more accurate
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
the information more value of what it is
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
so if it's if it's determinations on the
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
street level that um it's a bias crime
 
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
and then at trial a witness comes
 
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
forward and and it turns out that was
 
00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
all incorrect that information is no
 
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
longer valuable other than the fact that
 
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
an officer made a determination so it's
 
00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:06.039 align:start position:0%
it's just maybe something we have to
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
look at further down the road to make
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
the information more accurate sure um
 
00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.029 align:start position:0%
the information more accurate sure um
representative

00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
taking my question yes sir um I don't
 
00:23:20.909 --> 00:23:20.919 align:start position:0%
know if there's a requirement for the
 
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
locals to report hate crimes now or not
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
but I'd be curious I'd be curious for
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
what the effect of the six months do you
 
00:23:29.789 --> 00:23:29.799 align:start position:0%
think you'll get more information less
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
information how do you think that will
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
affect what you get now I think we'd get
 
00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:35.559 align:start position:0%
the same information I just think the
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
message to them would be that it's
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
important and it needs to be done more
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
frequently um I I can't say that it
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
isn't happening now it may very well be
 
00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:45.799 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis when we're we're
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
expecting these folks to to send us
 
00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
their files for upload into the
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
repository for the
 
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
FBI um I just think it put puts emphasis
 
00:23:55.149 --> 00:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
on it to make sure that you know if they
 
00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
have a long prosecution or a long
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
investigation or something like that
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
that you know it it it gets the focus
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
and attention it needs so I don't I
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily see anything changing
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
from that perspective just that it it
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
puts more emphasis on it to get it get a
 
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
determination made in order to report it
 
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
you know um more frequently really thank
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
you representative seig thank you Mr
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you so much for taking
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
my question I actually two questions
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
that are related um the first is
 
00:24:31.149 --> 00:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
essentially a followup on on chairman
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
Roy's question about if someone's found
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
not guilty but it doesn't mean the crime
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
hasn't still been committed it just
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
means that that person was found not
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
guilty being committed that's what I was
 
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
trying to say not as quite as eloquently
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
or curtailed but yes if if I can ask the
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
second part which is um with with crimes
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
hate crimes we know that sometimes are
 
00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
committed by juveniles as well this data
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
wouldn't extrapolate out juveniles
 
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
because it's not talking about who's
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
being prosecuted or that it just would
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
indicate the number of crimes is that
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
correct it's basically you know did this
 
00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:05.799 align:start position:0%
circumstance set up facts rise to level
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
of a hate crime it's not we're not
 
00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.630 align:start position:0%
of a hate crime it's not we're not
necessarily

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
tracking on a national level you know
 
00:25:12.909 --> 00:25:12.919 align:start position:0%
the age of the offender we are you know
 
00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
certainly because we know who did it and
 
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
and who the who the offender was but not
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
in concert you know what I mean so thank
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:31.559 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you so one one example I can
 
00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
think of uh is one that occurred in
 
00:25:35.389 --> 00:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth where we've had uh swas
 
00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:38.200 align:start position:0%
stickers um that have been spray painted
 
00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
on a synagogue so in a case like that uh
 
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not even sure they've actually found
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
the person who's done it yet so under
 
00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:50.919 align:start position:0%
this system um that act um the fact that
 
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
it was reported that somebody spray
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
painted a swastika on a synagogue that
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
would actually be reported as a hate
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
crime not as uh
 
00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh criminal mischief or vandalism
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
or something like that well it would it
 
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
just has a hate crime element to it you
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
know what I mean the the the criminal
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
violation is just that criminal mischief
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
but it's motivated by a bias which is
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
which is the determination that could be
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
made you know almost immediately I would
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
presume upon re receiving that call or
 
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
that investigation so and that's I guess
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
the distinction we're trying to make
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
here is certainly in my mind that would
 
00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
be a pretty clear convincing and quickly
 
00:26:29.399 --> 00:26:31.190 align:start position:0%
be a pretty clear convincing and quickly
evident

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
evident
 
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
um bias motivated crime and should be
 
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.240 align:start position:0%
reported as such the fact that no
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
offenders have been located or
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
determined yet is is another piece to
 
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.029 align:start position:0%
determined yet is is another piece to
that

00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
but follow
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
up thank you and and what is what in
 
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
your mind is the value of
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
collecting this data um even if we never
 
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
find the offender and even if these uh
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
prosecuted I think education much like
 
00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned you know um I I I
 
00:27:08.909 --> 00:27:08.919 align:start position:0%
don't know who these offenders are
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
certainly it could have been anybody I
 
00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
suppose but you know the the the
 
00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
juvenile um Talk has come up and and I I
 
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
think there was some testimony that I
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
overheard yesterday online um and you
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
know I I I think certainly the juveniles
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
that have committed this type of offense
 
00:27:27.549 --> 00:27:27.559 align:start position:0%
are looking for some rise out of folks
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
and is it true truly motivated by a bias
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
I I don't know I I would tend to think
 
00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:35.559 align:start position:0%
that you know probably the juveniles in
 
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
some cases have heard that this gets a
 
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
rise out of people and gets their
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
attention in things and so I I think the
 
00:27:44.909 --> 00:27:44.919 align:start position:0%
value in it is certainly um where these
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
things are occurring um who the
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
offenders are I think will help us
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
understand whether it's an educational
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
issue whether it's a punishment issue
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
whether it's um
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
that there's may be some other Arena we
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
had not considered in both law making
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
and education relative to the to topic
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
so I I think it does have some value um
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
the real trouble is you know again
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
determining in some instances like this
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
one you know was it truly bias motivated
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
or was it just to get attention you know
 
00:28:21.789 --> 00:28:21.799 align:start position:0%
or or some other
 
00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:23.799 align:start position:0%
Factor but it will at least help us
 
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
start to understand you
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
know where and why hopefully but maybe
 
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:40.540 align:start position:0%
you broken
 
00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:50.750 align:start position:0%
you broken
[Music]

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.149 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
stand do you think in a way that would
 
00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.750 align:start position:0%
stand do you think in a way that would
in

00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
did in the restorative
 
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:10.630 align:start position:0%
did in the restorative
justice

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:14.909 --> 00:29:14.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
conviction is your question do you think
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
that the the prosecutors would push for
 
00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
convictions versus allowing a plea
 
00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
because of that would make the data
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
different I'm asking about yes I'm not
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not giv you know assuming
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
badt what I'm saying is just human
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
nature you believe that um this is
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
something that we need to pay attention
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
to and a conviction is what would get
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
the information out there rep do you
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
think that just naturally that would
 
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
create an incentive for um for
 
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
har I suppose if we change the standard
 
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
to be conviction related yes and that
 
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
that may very well be why it's not
 
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
conviction related it's simply uh
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
investigation related or at that level
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
so um I again I think it's important
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
maybe to look at conviction rates or
 
00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
data but certainly don't want to
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
incentivize that to to skew
 
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
anything and to be clear for based on
 
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
the line of questions on hearing I
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
wasn't suggesting that that would be the
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
requirement I was suggesting that would
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
be an additional data point that would
 
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
be important um further
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
there we go now we're on chair Roy
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
members of the House criminal justice
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
and Public Safety Committee my name is
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
Shawn lock I'm a senior Assistant
 
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
Attorney General and director of the
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
Attorney General civil rights unit I'm
 
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of the Attorney General's
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
office to lend support to Senate Bill
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
315 I'd prepared comments but in
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
listening to the questions the benefit
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
of going last is I think I'll start with
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
the questions that have come up over
 
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
this past half hour or so um so I want
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
to talk a little bit about the process
 
00:31:26.629 --> 00:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
what happens when a hate crime is
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
charged how is a hate crime char charged
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
so in New Hampshire any offense can
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
become a hate crime it is a sentencing
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
enhancement so it's something that gets
 
00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
added on it's an element in addition to
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
the underlying criminal offense that has
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
to be proven Beyond A Reasonable Doubt
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
for a person to be convicted of a hate
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
crime there's no separate hate crime
 
00:31:47.549 --> 00:31:47.559 align:start position:0%
kind of charge that gets brought it's
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
added on um that means that the
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
prosecutor has to show as was kind of
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
said at the beginning that the criminal
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
offense was substantially motivated by
 
00:31:57.629 --> 00:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
hostility towards the victims protect
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
what I call protected characteristics so
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
race religion sexual orientation gender
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
identity and
 
00:32:07.149 --> 00:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
others if that is done the person is
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
then and the jury convicts the person
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
and agrees uh they find them guilty of
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
the hate Mo and crime enhanced criminal
 
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
offense it increases the criminal
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
penalty that the person may face for
 
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors it rises to two to five
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
years for most felonies 10 to 30 and for
 
00:32:26.909 --> 00:32:26.919 align:start position:0%
felonies like murder and manslaughter it
 
00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
increases the penalty
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
further but that can't occur if police
 
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily kind of being
 
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
encouraged to identify hate motivated
 
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
conduct when it happens that's the
 
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
important element that's the important
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
element in emphasizing the collection of
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
this data is to kind of allow and
 
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
encourage law enforcement to look for
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
and and look for that hate motivation if
 
00:32:54.909 --> 00:32:54.919 align:start position:0%
and when it is present if and when it is
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
being alleged by a victim and you know
 
00:32:59.950 --> 00:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
kind of coming back to some of my
 
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
prepared comments the timely publication
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
of this data enables my office wait go
 
00:33:08.909 --> 00:33:08.919 align:start position:0%
back to the beginning here 5 years ago
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
our office issued protocols to Aid law
 
00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:12.519 align:start position:0%
enforcement and identifying
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
investigating and Reporting hate crimes
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
and Civil Rights Act violations it's a
 
00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
civil statute that I primarily enforce
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
but works similar to a hate crime charge
 
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
um we have since been training all new
 
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
police officers with a two-hour block of
 
00:33:30.909 --> 00:33:30.919 align:start position:0%
instruction on how to identify potential
 
00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
hate motivated acts and one goal in
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
doing that was to improve reporting of
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
hate crimes through the nber system
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
which is the national incident-based
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
Reporting System that's used by State
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
Police and others to capture this data
 
00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
and refer refer it up to the FBI um SB
 
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
315 takes that goal
 
00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.430 align:start position:0%
315 takes that goal
further

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
it reemphasizes the importance of
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
reporting but also sets additional
 
00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
standards guidance for law enforcement
 
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
before this you know it wasn't
 
00:34:02.669 --> 00:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily clear when an in I think
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
that's some of the conversation we've
 
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
had here today when something has to be
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
reported as a hate crime is it after a
 
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
person has been convicted is it when it
 
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
is suspected by the officer for the
 
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
purposes of gathering that initial crime
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
data you know we suggested my office
 
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
suggested that it should be based on
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Suspicion which is when the
 
00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
officer develops a suspicion that this
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
could be and it doesn't have to be the
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
investigating officer it could be up the
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
line so it could be a detective looking
 
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
at this case it could be the prosecutor
 
00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
when the case is referred to them that
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
develops a suspicion that this could be
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
a hate motivated act that's when it
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
needs to that data needs to be updated
 
00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
so it can be captured correctly if at
 
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
some point that suspicion is completely
 
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
dispelled there's no evidence you know
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
what what was initially believed to be a
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
hate crime turns out that it was not the
 
00:34:52.349 --> 00:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
case that data could be updated as well
 
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
but setting that
 
00:34:59.950 --> 00:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
standard has benefits it ensures that
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
hate crimes are being identified and
 
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
those conversations about whether or not
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
this person should be charged with a
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
hate crime is being is is occurring it
 
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
encourages law enforcement and the way I
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
often describe it when I'm training law
 
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement is that when there's
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
suspicion of a hate crime you're not
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
doing a misdemeanor investigation
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
anymore you're doing a felony level
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
investigation because that person is
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
facing felony level penalties including
 
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
significant periods of incarceration so
 
00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
you have to change how you're
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
approaching these cases to make sure
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
that it is is you know no stone unturned
 
00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
because you're charging someone with a
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
significant offense you want to make
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
sure you have all the evidence to secure
 
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
that conviction but you also want to
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
make sure if there is evidence that says
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
this person should not be charged in a
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
certain way that you've done that as
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
well there's also value even where a
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
suspect isn't identified because it
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
helps identify trends that affect
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
communities across the state and
 
00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
resources can be directed to those
 
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
communities to support them to support
 
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
those you know support the immediate
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
victims but also those who
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
live look worship love like those
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
victims because hate crimes don't occur
 
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
in isolation they don't occur you know
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
they are designed they message crimes
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
designed to do more and affect people
 
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
beyond the immediate victim of the
 
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
incident they're designed to send
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
messages to the entire community of
 
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
people who are like that person to send
 
00:36:20.349 --> 00:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
the message that you are unsafe here
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
you're unwelcome here and it has that
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
impact you know we receive when hate
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
crimes do occur in the Hampshire or when
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
they are suspected to have occur heard
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
people across entire communities reach
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
out asking what's going on with this
 
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
case what's happened here what can I do
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
to help um but also you know am I safe
 
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
here is this somewhere where like if
 
00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
something happens to me are police going
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
to respond appropriately are they going
 
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
to be available so the having this data
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
and understanding where resources need
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
to be directed is valuable in and of
 
00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
itself even if it doesn't lead to hate
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
crime convictions because maybe the
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
evidence can't prove that case Beyond A
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Doubt maybe you know the
 
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
evidence you know the there's a plea
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
that is more kind of successful maybe
 
00:37:05.309 --> 00:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
there's a call for restorative justice
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
because that is the appropriate response
 
00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
in that circumstance you know that may
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
be the case in those circumstances but
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
those victims and those communities
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
affected still need resources and
 
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
support so there is value even in
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
collecting the data even short of when
 
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
it leads to
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
convictions additionally the timely
 
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
publication of this data will enable my
 
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
office to cross check our reports and
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
referrals that we received from law
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement to make sure that you know
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
where people have reported potential
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
hate crimes or Civil Rights Act
 
00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
violations to us we can make sure that
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
gets reported and gets captured in state
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
police's data but also where we're
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
seeing data in State Police from
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
agencies or communities that haven't
 
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
reported things to us we can follow up
 
00:37:50.109 --> 00:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
with them to understand what's going on
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
in those communities why was this not
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
reported to us and one kind of final
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
note on that is you know with this bill
 
00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
in mind with the fact that our protocols
 
00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
have been issued and been promulgated
 
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.200 align:start position:0%
and been out there for over five year or
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
almost 5 years now we are looking at how
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
to engage re-engaging with law
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement engaging with prosecutors
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
engaging with the communities affected
 
00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:12.200 align:start position:0%
to see what more can where can we take
 
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
this further whether it is I think some
 
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
their points of tracking information
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
through from when it's reported as a
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
hate crime through to the conviction to
 
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
understand where might there be
 
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
hindrances to kind of taking that case
 
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's plea bargaining sometimes
 
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:27.640 align:start position:0%
it's a failure to secure a conviction
 
00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's a failure to identify a
 
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
suspect but understanding kind of what
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
is leading to the dis what might cause
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
the disparity between what is reported
 
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
in this data and what ultimately results
 
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
in convictions at the end of a trial so
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's you know more to be done in
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
terms of gathering this data but without
 
00:38:46.349 --> 00:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
this data we can't have those later
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
conversations because we don't even know
 
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
where we're beginning to figure out
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
where these cases end and so with all of
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
that in mind we would ask that you vote
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on SB 315 and I'm happy to
 
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.349 --> 00:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
scite in part of your testimony you said
 
00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
when you were training law enforcement
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
and there's an element
 
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
of Hate in Your crime that it's now
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
they're doing a felony investigation is
 
00:39:22.309 --> 00:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor get promoted to a felony
 
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
because of hate the element of hate it
 
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't become a felony I tell them to
 
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
treat it like a felony investigation
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
because the penalties the person faces
 
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
are like felony level penalties so uh
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
class B felony is a three and a half a
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
potential three and a half to sevene
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
period of incarceration a hate crime
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
enhanced misdemeanor is a two to five
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
year potential two to fiveyear period
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
That's why
 
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
yeah representative here at
 
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
G thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm not sure if this
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
question is for you if it should have
 
00:39:58.750 --> 00:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
been for um Captain Muzzy fuzzy yes but
 
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
um I received some data that gave hate
 
00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:03.640 align:start position:0%
crime information for 2022 and I think
 
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
he mentioned that April is the cut off
 
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
for you know giving that data to
 
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
whomever okay for the federals and so
 
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
for 20123 is that data available now so
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
that would be a question for Captain
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
Muzzy but um I
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
know the FBI I think recently released
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
and compiled with the data that's
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
provided by jurisdictions across the
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
country it's 2022 data so there is a lag
 
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
in the FBI certainly releasing the data
 
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the state police's kind
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:44.119 align:start position:0%
not representative s thank you and thank
 
00:40:46.589 --> 00:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question attorney um
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
you mentioned one use of the data could
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
be potentially directing resources to an
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
area so in the case where representative
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
Muse talked about the synagogue and
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth being um you know having
 
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
swastikas done and that one was actually
 
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:01.640 align:start position:0%
they caught the person but they have not
 
00:41:02.829 --> 00:41:02.839 align:start position:0%
yet caught the person who smashed the
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
windows the other day um would it mean
 
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
something like being able to direct
 
00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839 align:start position:0%
additional Financial Resources for
 
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
additional security or other measures to
 
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
protect against those things so it could
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
be it can Bean numerous things so some
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
of it could be you know when it comes to
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
houses of Warship I know that the
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
department of safety I think it's
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
division of Homeland Security and
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
emergency planning but they have
 
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
resources for houses of Warship um where
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
necessary to improve security or even to
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
do security walkthroughs and we've
 
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
encouraged when we've met with all
 
00:41:32.109 --> 00:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
different communities particularly
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
communities of Faith you know to
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
encourage engage with your local police
 
00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
departments to do walkthroughs and
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
security trainings in your in your
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
building because if anything were to
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
happen in that church synagogue Temple
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
of any sort mosque um they local police
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
knowing where things are knowing where
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
the doors are knowing where the hallways
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
are where people could hide that's value
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
that they won't otherwise have I mean I
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
know in some communities that the houses
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
of worship even uploaded blueprints to
 
00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
local police department so they know the
 
00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
layout of the space so kind of having
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
that information can help us Foster
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
those relationships can help direct
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
where you know available resources um
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
Financial Resources to victims uh
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
certainly depending on the nature of the
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
crime those victims Also may be eligible
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
to apply for assistance from our victims
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
Compensation Program so they could seek
 
00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
uh recovery of costs for you know
 
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
medical care or any other treatment that
 
00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
they may need or any other loss they may
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
have suffered as a result of the
 
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
criminal act so yes uh Financial
 
00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
Resources is one kind of opportunity but
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
also you know doing Outreach kind of
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
learning what the community's needs are
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
learning you know maybe if there are
 
00:42:40.589 --> 00:42:40.599 align:start position:0%
particular communities targeted maybe
 
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know helping to Foster programs and
 
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
opportunities to kind of bring people
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
together for who have been victims of
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
hate crimes and provide support directly
 
00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:51.559 align:start position:0%
to those individuals in the same way we
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
do for victims of sexual assault and
 
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
domestic violence ensuring that those
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
individuals have kind of appropriate
 
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%

and

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
what's I open the public hearing on
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 321
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
and invite the sponsor to introduce the
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
know morning Mr President
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee Mr
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
chair um for the record Jeb Bradley from
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
District 3 and wolfboro so Senator abbis
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
um was not able to be here today and
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
asked me to introduce this bill which
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
the Senate passed um and it is part of
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
our um bail reform package and was
 
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
included um in the past and bail reform
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
measures that I sponsored it does a
 
00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
couple of things um right now there is a
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption that if
 
00:44:37.549 --> 00:44:37.559 align:start position:0%
somebody um does
 
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
not show up for their court appearance
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
that they can be detained but it's not
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
mandatory and that rebuttable
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
presumption comes within um three times
 
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
being a no-show in 5 years and so CTI
 
00:44:58.990 --> 00:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 321 would change that to three
 
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
times in five years and then require be
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
um because there have been three
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
no-shows that the person shall be
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
detained that is um the first section of
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
the bill lines 3 through
 
00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
8 uh lines 9 through 12 um if a person
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
is detained pursuant to subsection a
 
00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
that person would have an opportunity at
 
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
a bail hearing um that that person can
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
submit evidence that the court would um
 
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
decide whether the person has rebutted
 
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
the presumption and that release would
 
00:45:38.829 --> 00:45:38.839 align:start position:0%
not reasonably assure the appearance of
 
00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
the person as required so this is part
 
00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
of our ongoing attempt to um fix
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
the issues that we have with our Bale
 
00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
statutes um the Senate has passed this
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
provision several times um it got hung
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
up in a committee of conference I
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
believe it was in
 
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
2022 and at that point um Senator abbis
 
00:46:14.589 --> 00:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
and Senator Susi who are the sponsors of
 
00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
Senate bills on bail decided to split um
 
00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
the two Provisions that we've been
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
considering uh the one provision that
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
this committee has done a lot of good
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
work on on um is the list of crimes for
 
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
which you would have to see a judge um
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
in order to um be granted bail so I I
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
just want to say thank you to all of you

00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%

to ensure that our bail system is
 
00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:05.240 align:start position:0%

members of the committee um uh for the
 
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:39.160 align:start position:0%
record my name is Becky Whitley I'm
 
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
honored to represent New Hampshire
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
Senate District 15 which includes the
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
wonderful communities of conquered Bo
 
01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
and hopkington today I'm honored to
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
introduce to you Senate Bill
 
01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
424 this bill was de uh developed in
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
close collaboration with the Department
 
01:02:57.789 --> 01:02:57.799 align:start position:0%
of Corrections and it merely refines
 
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
existing law by establishing a clear
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
framework for parole eligibility as
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
intended by the legislature the law as
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
it is currently written is vague and
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
does not provide probation parole
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
officers with legal
 
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
Direction on how to consistently
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
consider parole EAS for a reduction of
 
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
their maximum sentence so additionally
 
01:03:21.309 --> 01:03:21.319 align:start position:0%
individuals under administrative
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
supervision are only seen once per year
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
and this bill creates an annual audit
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
system an an annual audit requirement
 
01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
for those cases so I um also want to put
 
01:03:34.029 --> 01:03:34.039 align:start position:0%
this in context so I was the chair and
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
um two of the members uh of the
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
committee were on this committee as well
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh two years ago this uh legislature
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
created Senate Bill five or passed
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 251 which created a
 
01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
committee to look at the adult parole
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
system it was an incredibly productive
 
01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
committee we met many many times over
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
the summer and the fall hearing from
 
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
everyone involved in the system um folks
 
01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
who were impacted folks who run the
 
01:04:06.029 --> 01:04:06.039 align:start position:0%
system folks who are are related to the
 
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
system and we came up with a pretty
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
comprehensive report so in its report um
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
the sp251 committee recommended the
 
01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
development of clear and concise policy
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
language and parole guidelines to
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
provide greater structure when weighing
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
or evaluating the factors associated
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
with the decision to Grant or deny
 
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
parole so um I want I I'm happy to take
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
any technical questions um I will try to
 
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
but certainly the Department of
 
01:04:39.269 --> 01:04:39.279 align:start position:0%

01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
know answer the more detailed questions
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
but we're not
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
changing polic we're not changing policy
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
we're just taking existing practice is
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
my understanding and making it clear in
 
01:04:53.269 --> 01:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
the statute I think this is good for the
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
the folks who run the parole system and
 
01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:57.400 align:start position:0%

parole by adding additional factors for
 
01:06:34.349 --> 01:06:34.359 align:start position:0%
parole board to consider when making the
 
01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
decision on whether to Grant someone a
 
01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
reduction of their maximum
 
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
sentence by adding factors such as
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
employment engagement with treatment
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
compliance with parole conditions and
 
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
others it encourages parole e to engage
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
in productive behavior and
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative treatment in order to
 
01:06:52.589 --> 01:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
lessen their time on
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
supervision finally this bill creates an
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
annual audit which Senator Whitley had
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
just referred to requirement for the

in address or plans to relocate out of

significant non-compliance with their

individual under administrative
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
supervision this has the potential to
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
increase the number of deserving
 
01:08:24.749 --> 01:08:24.759 align:start position:0%
individuals appearing before the Adult
 
01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
Parole Board to have their maximum
 
01:08:29.309 --> 01:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
sentence reduced this in turn will
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
decrease the case loads of the probation
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
PR officers allowing them to dedicate
 
01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
essential time and resources to those
 
01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
individuals on supervision who need it
 
01:08:37.159 --> 01:08:37.990 align:start position:0%
individuals on supervision who need it
the

01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
most thank you again for the opportunity
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of Senate Bill 424
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions that you
 
01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.590 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions that you
may

01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
have thank you could you um could you
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
take give us a hypothetical rly and just
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
kind of walk us through how this would
 
01:08:59.630 --> 01:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
apply so someone um is incarcerated for
 
01:09:02.349 --> 01:09:02.359 align:start position:0%
whatever they become eligible for in our
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
granted parole that's when this new
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
legislation would come into effect
 
01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
correct so if you were sentenced to uh
 
01:09:11.149 --> 01:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
say two and a half to five years in the
 
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:13.159 align:start position:0%
state prison yeah at the two and a half
 
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
year mark you're eligible for parole you
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
go in front of the parole board say your
 
01:09:21.070 --> 01:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
peace and hopefully granted parole now
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
you're on Community Supervision which is
 
01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
being supervised by approbation parole
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
officer in the community when that
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
happens as long as uh if it's a felony
 
01:09:32.269 --> 01:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
level offense if they're on supervision
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
for 18 months and they're basically low
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
not really a high need person that needs
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
to be supervised on a daily basis a
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
weekly basis or po you know even a
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
monthly basis they could get reduced
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
down to administrative status as long as
 
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
they're rated as a low uh which like I
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
said is a real low need we we trust the
 
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
fact they're doing the right thing
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
they're gainfully employed they have
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
family support they're not housing
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
challenged uh they have food they
 
01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
they're not hanging around with the
 
01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
people that they were potentially no
 
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
substance use issues or they're dealing
 
01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
with treatment for it uh mental health
 
01:10:13.950 --> 01:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
issues are being addressed so once
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
you've been on
 
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
administrative uh supervision for about
 
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
18 months that's when we'd like to look
 
01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
at somebody and say okay this person's
 
01:10:24.669 --> 01:10:24.679 align:start position:0%
doing all the right things how do we
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
reward them
 
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
how can we help them better themselves
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
and let them continue on the right path
 
01:10:31.709 --> 01:10:31.719 align:start position:0%
which is our goal Rehabilitation and
 
01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
getting people back to society to being
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
productive so at that 18-month Mark we
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
want to be able to look at and say okay
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
this person deserves a reduction in
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
their maximum sentence would be that
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
five years because you're on supervision
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
from that you know two and a half year
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
mark to five years so two and a half
 
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
more years on supervision as a perole Le
 
01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
if we see they're doing well for a year
 
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
and a half well then we we can knock
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
some of that time off and say all right
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
we've done our job we've helped
 
01:10:59.229 --> 01:10:59.239 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate this person we've given
 
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
them the guidance and the tools to be
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
productive now let's let them free to
 
01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
see if they continue on that path okay
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
so after a successful period on
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
administrative um parole yeah then this
 
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
would contemplate looking at okay so we
 
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
can take up to a third of your remaining
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
Paro time correct and you're you're all
 
01:11:25.709 --> 01:11:25.719 align:start position:0%
wrapped up you're good to go and this
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
statute is giving guidelines to both the
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
parole officer and the parole board as
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
to what they should consider when
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
they're considering giving that onethird
 
01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
yes it it gives you the time time
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
periods and it also gives you the amount
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
that they can reduce okay great um any
 
01:11:44.629 --> 01:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
questions representative here gather
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um director white um how
 
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
many people did you say are eligible now
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
400 and something there's approximately
 
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
455 on administrative supervision
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
currently okay thank you
 
01:11:57.199 --> 01:11:58.550 align:start position:0%
currently okay thank you
other

01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
questions um correct me if I'm wrong so
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
many of our our benefits and um even
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
things that um would help someone clear
 
01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
their record there's a time period that
 
01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
tolls and and that doesn't start to toll
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
until the sentence is complete and part
 
01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
of that is their parle of probation so
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
the earlier they get that done the
 
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
sooner they can qualify for certain
 
01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
things is that correct that is correct
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
once once they've wrapped up their
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
sentence then the time starts
 
01:12:27.629 --> 01:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
before they can consider being seeking
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
out an En helment to remove their record
 
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:33.880 align:start position:0%

01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
we are opening the public
 
01:28:48.510 --> 01:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
hearing on where is it 426 Senate Bill
 
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
426 and I invite who do we got
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
Bill let me turn on the mic here I'm
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
Senator Bill Ganon I represent District
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
23 a beautiful area in Sandown to seab
 
01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
Brook in commonly known in my area as
 
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
the wine region come on down to sand
 
01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
down we have great wines at know um
 
01:29:26.669 --> 01:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
that's my little plug it's supposed to
 
01:29:31.109 --> 01:29:31.119 align:start position:0%
be funny um tough tough crowd so this
 
01:29:34.030 --> 01:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
bill was um I brought it on behalf of
 
01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
the police Chiefs and the way reason we
 
01:29:40.149 --> 01:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
bought it it brought it Forward is we're
 
01:29:42.270 --> 01:29:42.280 align:start position:0%
concerned with impaired driving on the
 
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
roads um especially poly use driving but
 
01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
I won't get into that too much mix of
 
01:29:49.229 --> 01:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
alcohol and drugs at the same time but
 
01:29:51.109 --> 01:29:51.119 align:start position:0%
deaths are up accidents are up they even
 
01:29:54.030 --> 01:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
found one guy a couple months ago in 93
 
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
two in the morning passed out in his car
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the road so I'm
 
01:30:00.109 --> 01:30:00.119 align:start position:0%
concerned with the safety of all of us I
 
01:30:01.870 --> 01:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
have four kids I want them safe out
 
01:30:03.310 --> 01:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
there and I want your kids safe out
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
there surrounding states have done this
 
01:30:07.390 --> 01:30:07.400 align:start position:0%
type of law Massachusetts vermod
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
California Colorado Illinois Washington
 
01:30:13.229 --> 01:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
Washington State DC amongst others so
 
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
the idea is it's sort of like a wingspan
 
01:30:20.189 --> 01:30:20.199 align:start position:0%
rule um which is a common idea in law
 
01:30:21.709 --> 01:30:21.719 align:start position:0%
that you try to keep everything as far
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
away from the driver in his wingspan as
 
01:30:25.229 --> 01:30:25.239 align:start position:0%
possible possible it's more used with
 
01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
guns and other stuff but it's the same
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
concept so we have if we I've been told
 
01:30:32.189 --> 01:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
for years and years everyone wanted to
 
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
treat marijuana medicinal or whatever
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
the same as alcohol so we won't talk
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
about medicinal at the moment we'll get
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
to that in the second but if you have a
 
01:30:43.109 --> 01:30:43.119 align:start position:0%
container of alcohol you can't have it
 
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
sitting next to you when you're driving
 
01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
in the car you have to have it as far
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
away as possible so ideally if you've
 
01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
opened a container of gummies or
 
01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
whatever you have any type of marijuana
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
ideally you'd place it in your trunk uh
 
01:30:57.310 --> 01:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
you might have a pickup truck you can't
 
01:30:59.229 --> 01:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
do that so we want you to place it again
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
as far as possible under the back seat
 
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
in the glove compartment uh if you only
 
01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
had a cab truck it would probably be
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
under the passenger seat or in the glove
 
01:31:10.510 --> 01:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
compartment but again trying to keep it
 
01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
Out Of Reach of the driver same idea as
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
alcohol an open bottle you keep it as
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
far away certainly you don't have it
 
01:31:20.189 --> 01:31:20.199 align:start position:0%
next to in the seat um so we were
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
concerned and um you guys have 20 people
 
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
we only have a few in our committee so
 
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
there was concern now with people having
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
therapeutic Cannabis cards how should we
 
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
treat them because it's now a medicine
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
it was brought so we did the an
 
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
amendment to say if you have a cannabis
 
01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
card we would try to treat that like a
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
prescription drug so that's a little
 
01:31:46.910 --> 01:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
gray area that I don't think we handled
 
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
it quite well in our Amendment we have
 
01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
an amendment and the idea was to treat
 
01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
that like a drug you could have the open
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
container because if you an opioid
 
01:31:57.910 --> 01:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
prescription and you took something
 
01:32:00.669 --> 01:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
um so it's a little weak because then
 
01:32:03.229 --> 01:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to have Treat marijuana
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
differently in two two situations but we
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
really couldn't figure a better way
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
around it before we got out of the
 
01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
committee so the best we could do was
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
this amendment uh to keep both sides
 
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
happy it did go through I believe 50 and
 
01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
committee and I think it went fairly
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
well through the Senate not sure if it
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
was unanimous or not but again so that
 
01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
would be the only area if you guys had
 
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
better thoughts than we did as to
 
01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
amending it for someone with a
 
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
prescription cannabis card because again
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
I don't want them really taking the
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
gummies either while they're driving so
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a I saw the flaw especially
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
last night when I was looking at this
 
01:32:39.229 --> 01:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
I'm like oh we didn't really do but
 
01:32:40.669 --> 01:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
that's why we have you guys to clean up
 
01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
our small little arrows and um that is
 
01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
about it and um I look forward to any
 
01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
questions and I don't know if law
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement's going to testify after us
 
01:32:51.310 --> 01:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
but they may
 
01:32:53.629 --> 01:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
be thank you Senator was there any
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
thought thought given to just treating
 
01:32:58.109 --> 01:32:58.119 align:start position:0%
it exactly the same as alcohol I've I've
 
01:33:00.109 --> 01:33:00.119 align:start position:0%
brought this for Bill forward before and
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
it was always exactly the same as
 
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
alcohol because I now it's going to have
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
Pro there's potential problems with
 
01:33:09.229 --> 01:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
something had you know you had to open
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
container gummies and you're like oh no
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
that's my medicine I take that
 
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
for um but it still can you know raise
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
your THC level and make you high so
 
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
again it's a safety concern but last
 
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
minute we didn't see a better way of
 
01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
doing it um it the therapeutic cannabis
 
01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
board came forward and they brought to a
 
01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
couple people's attention that we were
 
01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
treating this knot as a medicine if you
 
01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
had a therapeutic card um in years past
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
again it's two or three times has come
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
here before just straight out treat it
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
like a you know a open container of
 
01:33:43.229 --> 01:33:43.239 align:start position:0%
alcohol Keep It Out Of Reach as far as
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
possible whatever part of the vehicle
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
be and with I was hoping law enforcement
 
01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
was going to testify but with regard to
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement concern that they
 
01:33:57.149 --> 01:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
wanted you to bring this
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
um what is it they're find they're
 
01:34:01.070 --> 01:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
finding obviously what the guy passed
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
out that was probably opioids but what
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
is there concern that people are smoking
 
01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
and driving is that a lot more so like
 
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
two out of three accidents especially
 
01:34:11.709 --> 01:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
it's even higher I believe in um in
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
crashes um it's about 66% are poly use
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
is now the common thing you know you're
 
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
drinking and you're smoking they're
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
finding that as one of the most common
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
but I mean you could just be drunk and
 
01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
impaired and you could just be stoned
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
and impaired but um po use seems to be a
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
very big problem at the moment um so at
 
01:34:33.390 --> 01:34:33.400 align:start position:0%
the accident scenes that's what's
 
01:34:35.189 --> 01:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
they're find two out of three is a poly
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
use and um which I understand because as
 
01:34:40.830 --> 01:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
an attorney I've always it's bothered me
 
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
that if you're drunk we can get you with
 
01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:43.470 align:start position:0%
that if you're drunk we can get you with
the

01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
0.08 and again get you means I want the
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
roads to be safe it doesn't mean that
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
I'm after anyone for us and um I
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
personally don't like either one too
 
01:34:55.470 --> 01:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
much but um um again I've probably been
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
at accident scenes too many times um
 
01:35:02.910 --> 01:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
what was your question more um so so yes
 
01:35:05.709 --> 01:35:05.719 align:start position:0%
so law enforcement has come to me and um
 
01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner Edwards testified in the
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
Senate on it I had a lot of law
 
01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement testify that I'm sorry they
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
got I used up all their time I guess um
 
01:35:16.629 --> 01:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
but yeah the accidents are going up
 
01:35:19.870 --> 01:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
they're swapping people and um we had
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
someone in one of your committees last
 
01:35:23.709 --> 01:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
year who said they were using gummies
 
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
while they I believe it was last year
 
01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
while they were Al and um it just people
 
01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
don't take it serious enough I don't
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
mind what you do recreational at home or
 
01:35:35.189 --> 01:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
if you have a um if you have a condition
 
01:35:37.149 --> 01:35:37.159 align:start position:0%
you got a medical card that's great but
 
01:35:39.550 --> 01:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
you can't do it when you're driving um
 
01:35:41.950 --> 01:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
AC are up and again it's the police have
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
reported about 66% increase uh in usage
 
01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
and they're having problems so we just
 
01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
want the roads to be safe okay um any
 
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
further questions for Sen yeah
 
01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
representative n
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:35:58.030 --> 01:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you I'm curious
 
01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
about um you know with alcohol it's very
 
01:36:02.669 --> 01:36:02.679 align:start position:0%
clear how it would be a sealed bottle um
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
but how would we ensure that you know
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
just in the ways that I've seen um you
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
know the purchase of marijuana if it's
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh how do you how do you ensure I mean
 
01:36:14.109 --> 01:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
is there is it sealed and then you would
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
be able to tell if the seal was
 
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
broken again so I probably have less
 
01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
familiarity with the packaging than I
 
01:36:25.629 --> 01:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
should um talking about so um I I don't
 
01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
really know what the pedge so if you had
 
01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
ideally You' put you had an open
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
container of anything um a bag of
 
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
gummies you'd put it in the trunk um you
 
01:36:36.030 --> 01:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
don't have a trunk put it under the back
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
seat Senator abis was concerned then
 
01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
well geez my kids might be in the back
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
seat and you're putting it um so there
 
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
are always concerns but which just the
 
01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
furthest point away from you is is our
 
01:36:48.430 --> 01:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
ideal thing glove compartments everyone
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
seems to have one so if it's there it's
 
01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
not so hard for you to get when you're
 
01:36:55.470 --> 01:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
getting out of the car but it would be
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
pretty hard to get to if you wanted to
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
get them while you're using them okay
 
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um our our thought is glove
 
01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
box is like a nice safe area if you
 
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
don't have a truck trunk can I follow up
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
really quickly um so and I understand
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
that that makes sense to me for it to be
 
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
Out Of Reach um absolutely but it does
 
01:37:15.070 --> 01:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
include the language um the same
 
01:37:17.310 --> 01:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
language as um alcohol which would be
 
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be in a a sealed
 
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
container and and that would be um
 
01:37:21.870 --> 01:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
something that makes the difference in
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
here and I think that that might not
 
01:37:25.470 --> 01:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
make make sense in the in the case of
 
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
marijuana um can you explain the
 
01:37:29.149 --> 01:37:29.159 align:start position:0%
packaging to me more so here we got our
 
01:37:30.910 --> 01:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
bottle right we got a cap on you don't
 
01:37:32.189 --> 01:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
want that sitting next to you you want
 
01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
it at least if you had that open whiskey
 
01:37:36.669 --> 01:37:36.679 align:start position:0%
bottle have it under the back seat so
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
officer pulls you over he knows at least
 
01:37:40.030 --> 01:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
you don't have it there and they'll say
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
have you been drinking you might say I
 
01:37:43.629 --> 01:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
have a bottle that's under the back seat
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
what is the packaging like with well
 
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
gummies is it ziplock I'm not familiar
 
01:37:50.830 --> 01:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry there's no law that says you
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
have to keep in original packaging so
 
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
like with prescription drugs I believe
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
there's a federal law I'm not sure if
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statute mirrors it that
 
01:37:58.589 --> 01:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to keep in the original
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
drug with the prescription on it since
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
this is illegal Fe federally that
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply so someone could get a
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
package with a seal open it and just
 
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
take a couple put it in a baggie or
 
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
whatever they want so it's really
 
01:38:14.109 --> 01:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
difficult to focus on the packaging as
 
01:38:16.270 --> 01:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
much as the wingspan as you discussed
 
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
sure okay thank you claring yes I
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you Newman no so I
 
01:38:24.109 --> 01:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
I'm relying on you maybe to tweak Newman
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
sailing thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:38:29.229 --> 01:38:29.239 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I I know like
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
when I've been prescribed medication for
 
01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
my doctor after posts surgery you know
 
01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
it always comes with the label saying do
 
01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
not drive while using do we have um is
 
01:38:40.990 --> 01:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
there anything with with medical
 
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
marijuana you may not know the answer to
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
this but that would have a similar type
 
01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
of warning label like this is it is not
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
recommended to drive while using this
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
product not sure you guys may know more
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
than I I think when you get the card
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
they may may emphasize that but I'm not
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
sure um I see representative M but first
 
01:38:58.480 --> 01:38:59.750 align:start position:0%
sure um I see representative M but first
representative

01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
Murray okay she WS off representative um
 
01:39:07.390 --> 01:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
M thank you I I just want to verify I
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
see that the the Senate did amend the
 
01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
bill uh the original bill um and I think
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
the part that was amended is uh right up
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
front uh where it says the word
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
marijuana is used in this used as used
 
01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
in this section she have the same
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
meaning uh as defined in RSA 38 B and
 
01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
shall not include therapeutic cannabis
 
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
so am I understanding you are correct
 
01:39:33.189 --> 01:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding that this doesn't the
 
01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:34.679 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis would not be
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
included under the scope we would not
 
01:39:38.910 --> 01:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
treat yeah it was so okay uh Senator
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
Whitley and the head of the therapeutic
 
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis came up with this language that
 
01:39:46.030 --> 01:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
was acceptable to the majority so okay I
 
01:39:50.830 --> 01:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
negotiation see no further questions
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator thank you very much
 
01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
have a great day we'll see what we can
 
01:39:59.790 --> 01:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
do with this um chair calls
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:40:14.350 --> 01:40:14.360 align:start position:0%
committee members for having me today my
 
01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:16.719 align:start position:0%
name is representative Heath Howard I
 
01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
represent straford 4 which is the towns
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
of straford and barington uh as of right
 
01:40:25.790 --> 01:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
now I'm neutral on this legislation uh I
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
support the intent I think that the
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
intent is uh good because we shouldn't
 
01:40:32.189 --> 01:40:32.199 align:start position:0%
have people impaired while they're
 
01:40:35.709 --> 01:40:35.719 align:start position:0%
operating motor vehicle uh however I do
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
have some worries about some of the
 
01:40:40.109 --> 01:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
specifics in the language uh especially
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the original container
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
in The Unbroken seal uh especially if
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
you know somebody is going to uh uh
 
01:40:52.589 --> 01:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
somewhere else outside of their original
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
private property
 
01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
so if somebody owns say two homes and
 
01:40:58.589 --> 01:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
they're transporting uh their
 
01:41:02.109 --> 01:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis uh for instance up
 
01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
from that sing that first home up to
 
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
that second home uh they could not
 
01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
potentially have the original container
 
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
with an unbroken seal and so I think
 
01:41:14.030 --> 01:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
that that could pose a potential risk uh
 
01:41:17.310 --> 01:41:17.320 align:start position:0%
for people being uh
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
unintentionally uh charged with
 
01:41:22.189 --> 01:41:22.199 align:start position:0%
something that they were not necessarily
 
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
intending on
 
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh doing in the first place when they
 
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
may have been trying to follow the law
 
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
as closely as they could uh when it
 
01:41:31.470 --> 01:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
comes to uh representative selig
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
question about uh whether or not there
 
01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
are labels on uh the therapeutic
 
01:41:39.390 --> 01:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis products there are there are
 
01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
warnings saying that you should not
 
01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
operate a motor vehicle uh I believe
 
01:41:45.709 --> 01:41:45.719 align:start position:0%
that there are a few others I don't have
 
01:41:49.149 --> 01:41:49.159 align:start position:0%
uh a the warning label on me uh at the
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
current moment but I I could definitely
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
get you some additional information
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
about that if you'd like more uh I can
 
01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
contact you after the committee uh but
 
01:42:01.629 --> 01:42:01.639 align:start position:0%
that being said uh there I think needs
 
01:42:04.669 --> 01:42:04.679 align:start position:0%
to be a little bit more of a broader uh
 
01:42:07.709 --> 01:42:07.719 align:start position:0%
language to kind of generalize things
 
01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:10.639 align:start position:0%
that still kind of shows that the driver
 
01:42:10.639 --> 01:42:11.950 align:start position:0%
that still kind of shows that the driver
is

01:42:11.950 --> 01:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
intending uh on trying to keep the
 
01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
Cannabis products as far away as uh from
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
them as possible uh I'm open to any
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
man thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question um this is concerning
 
01:42:32.189 --> 01:42:32.199 align:start position:0%
your issue about it being the
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
partially uh secure open container maybe
 
01:42:37.149 --> 01:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
in different packaging and I might be
 
01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
wrong but the way I read this is it says
 
01:42:41.430 --> 01:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
securely capped partially filled
 
01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
containers of marijuana or marijuana any
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
other form of unsealed packaging shall
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
be stored or transported in the trunk of
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
the motor vehicle I think that satisfies
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
your concern with that yes but uh as we
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
had heard
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh not necessarily every vehicle has uh
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
a a a trunk uh if somebody has a truck
 
01:43:01.589 --> 01:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
for instance uh putting it in the bed
 
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
their truck is not necessarily the most
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
feasible option uh especially if they
 
01:43:09.390 --> 01:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
have a sing glove box too doesn't it uh
 
01:43:12.189 --> 01:43:12.199 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah if I just follow up and that
 
01:43:14.510 --> 01:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
does say that if you don't have a trunk
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
or whatever you can wherever is the
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
least accessible to the driver is a
 
01:43:20.669 --> 01:43:20.679 align:start position:0%
place you should keep it so I yes if I
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
interpret this correctly I think that's
 
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
satisfies your concerns with uh with the
 
01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
bill yeah I I I just I'm a bit wary of
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
the specific language and how we need to
 
01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
go about this just a little bit more
 
01:43:34.589 --> 01:43:34.599 align:start position:0%
generally rather than kind of referring
 
01:43:36.629 --> 01:43:36.639 align:start position:0%
to specifics about where the driver
 
01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
should be placing it and just kind of
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
stating that it should not be within
 
01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:40.870 align:start position:0%
stating that it should not be within
their

01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:43:44.589 --> 01:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
reach thank you thank you for your
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
testimony anyone else anyone else

01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
that I open the public hearing on Senate
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 653 and I recognize Senor Ganon to
 
01:58:55.310 --> 01:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
introduce this Bill thank you very much
 
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh thank you all for having
 
01:59:00.149 --> 01:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
me today I'm Senator Bill Ganon I rip
 
01:59:02.430 --> 01:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
I'm from Sandown again from the wine
 
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
District of New Hampshire spanning from
 
01:59:07.669 --> 01:59:07.679 align:start position:0%
Seabrook to Chester but not forgetting
 
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
Sandown um I come today before you I'll
 
01:59:13.310 --> 01:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
tell you why we got here um I go to a
 
01:59:16.270 --> 01:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
lot of town fairs in the summer um you
 
01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
guys all probably do door knocking and
 
01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
stuff but Town Fair is one of my big
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
things and the last two years every body
 
01:59:25.470 --> 01:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
who's come to my booth um two out of
 
01:59:27.629 --> 01:59:27.639 align:start position:0%
three it's immigration they want to talk
 
01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:30.639 align:start position:0%
about the open border policy um number
 
01:59:34.109 --> 01:59:34.119 align:start position:0%
two is um is the economy but number one
 
01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
seems to always be immigration more and
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
more so lately um so my constituents
 
01:59:42.069 --> 01:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
have come to me from pretty much all 12
 
01:59:45.069 --> 01:59:45.079 align:start position:0%
towns and they've said to me you know
 
01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
the federal government's not doing
 
01:59:49.109 --> 01:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
anything um as a matter of fact they
 
01:59:51.550 --> 01:59:51.560 align:start position:0%
feel that um we have no border at all at
 
01:59:53.229 --> 01:59:53.239 align:start position:0%
the moment
 
01:59:56.030 --> 01:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
and that we're suffering the effects as
 
01:59:57.870 --> 01:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
we've seen in Massachusetts where
 
01:59:59.790 --> 01:59:59.800 align:start position:0%
they're now housing people uh right near
 
02:00:01.229 --> 02:00:01.239 align:start position:0%
where my daughter lives at the Reggie
 
02:00:03.229 --> 02:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
Lewis Center they've entered out their
 
02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
main facility that the community uses um
 
02:00:09.390 --> 02:00:09.400 align:start position:0%
for senior work for tons of stuff they
 
02:00:11.109 --> 02:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
do at that Reggie Lewis Center and it's
 
02:00:13.470 --> 02:00:13.480 align:start position:0%
full of immigrants now in fact the
 
02:00:15.510 --> 02:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
governor of Massachusetts went so far as
 
02:00:18.430 --> 02:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
to say there is no more room we need
 
02:00:20.069 --> 02:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
people to volunteer and start taking
 
02:00:23.069 --> 02:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
people in um it comes very close to New
 
02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Senator abbis um his community
 
02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
um down at the methan border uh I
 
02:00:31.709 --> 02:00:31.719 align:start position:0%
believe it's a Ramada in an old Inn they
 
02:00:33.669 --> 02:00:33.679 align:start position:0%
took over the whole thing so one half
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
mile from our border now and the problem
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
is not the people themselves I'm sure
 
02:00:40.189 --> 02:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
most of them are looking for a better
 
02:00:41.870 --> 02:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
life just like all our grandparents and
 
02:00:44.510 --> 02:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
great grandparents were and they're here
 
02:00:46.149 --> 02:00:46.159 align:start position:0%
to raise their families and live an
 
02:00:48.870 --> 02:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
American Dream unfortunately they're not
 
02:00:52.030 --> 02:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
being vetted and so mixed in with those
 
02:00:54.270 --> 02:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
as homeland security has said are
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
hundreds of they've people on the
 
02:00:58.430 --> 02:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
terrorist watch list we know people are
 
02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
being coyotes bringing people in it's
 
02:01:03.790 --> 02:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
bringing un enough fentanyl to kill us
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
all in the whole country is coming
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
through the southern border so it's a
 
02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
problem that's made every state a border
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
state um according to the committee on
 
02:01:16.990 --> 02:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
homeland security it costs approximately
 
02:01:20.430 --> 02:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
481 billion dollars per year to feed
 
02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
clothes house educate all the expenses
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
um associated with the 10 or so million
 
02:01:28.669 --> 02:01:28.679 align:start position:0%
people have come in in the last 3 to
 
02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
four years and again our main problem is
 
02:01:33.390 --> 02:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
they're not being properly vetted so we
 
02:01:35.589 --> 02:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
do not know who's in the community so
 
02:01:37.149 --> 02:01:37.159 align:start position:0%
who would that be that would be people
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
like um we had the man in Rye who was a
 
02:01:41.950 --> 02:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
mass murderer from Brazil who had
 
02:01:44.990 --> 02:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
executed uh 12 people in Brazil but he
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
was living and working amongst us
 
02:01:49.470 --> 02:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
driving from miramac every day working
 
02:01:52.669 --> 02:01:52.679 align:start position:0%
to his painting job in Ry it also
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
includes people like in do we had an
 
02:01:59.910 --> 02:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
arms dealer um living in plain sight and
 
02:02:02.910 --> 02:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
um he had come over illegally we had
 
02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
we've had rapists we've had coyotes on
 
02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
the Canadian
 
02:02:09.149 --> 02:02:09.159 align:start position:0%
border it tends to be a magnet for
 
02:02:12.069 --> 02:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
problems and again we have watched our
 
02:02:13.790 --> 02:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
other states you were watching every
 
02:02:15.870 --> 02:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
night if you turn on the TV we're
 
02:02:18.109 --> 02:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
watching activities of the bad and I
 
02:02:20.430 --> 02:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
admit it's probably not representative
 
02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:22.679 align:start position:0%
of the crowd but we are seeing we just
 
02:02:24.870 --> 02:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
can't handle this flow we could handle a
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
much smaller flow of illegal immigrants
 
02:02:32.550 --> 02:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
but um it's a problem so this bill
 
02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
focuses on a very small area but that's
 
02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
why we're doing it that's why we're
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
brought the bill we don't want New
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to become like Massachusetts
 
02:02:42.589 --> 02:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
New York and these other states where
 
02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
the governors their Mayors are saying we
 
02:02:46.910 --> 02:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
can't handle this we can't handle the
 
02:02:50.149 --> 02:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
cost we can't handle the security and um
 
02:02:52.109 --> 02:02:52.119 align:start position:0%
if we allow a sanctuary City I know
 
02:02:53.669 --> 02:02:53.679 align:start position:0%
we're a local we'd like to think we're a
 
02:02:57.069 --> 02:02:57.079 align:start position:0%
local control State uh which we're not
 
02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
but if the town of Lebanon which has a
 
02:03:06.189 --> 02:03:06.199 align:start position:0%
welcoming ordinance which anyone else uh
 
02:03:07.709 --> 02:03:07.719 align:start position:0%
by whatever term you want to use it it
 
02:03:10.870 --> 02:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
is a sanctuary city ordinance um as does
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
the town of Hanover as do several others
 
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
and so just because you Ed the word
 
02:03:18.310 --> 02:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
welcoming the problem I have with these
 
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
ordinances is that they tell the police
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
officer in the department they shall not
 
02:03:26.950 --> 02:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
um cooperate with the federal
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
authorities at all they shall not
 
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
disclose information regarding
 
02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
citizenship or immigration status they
 
02:03:34.870 --> 02:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
won't let it not to allow anyone into
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
the police facilities to interrogate
 
02:03:38.189 --> 02:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
they're not supposed to even make the
 
02:03:40.629 --> 02:03:40.639 align:start position:0%
phone call if they do a police officer
 
02:03:42.830 --> 02:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
thinks that's in the public safety they
 
02:03:45.950 --> 02:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
risk being fired um and sanctioned under
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
these welcoming ordinances so what we're
 
02:03:51.790 --> 02:03:51.800 align:start position:0%
asking people to do if a police officer
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
is pulling someone over say they were
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
pulling a DUI over and the person either
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
tells them or it comes to their
 
02:04:00.589 --> 02:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
knowledge that the person is not here
 
02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
legally we want them to and then they
 
02:04:05.709 --> 02:04:05.719 align:start position:0%
find out there's a detainer notice that
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
comes up on their screen says detainer
 
02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
wanted by Ice Homeland Security we're
 
02:04:12.109 --> 02:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
not asking them to do much we're asking
 
02:04:16.549 --> 02:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
them to make a phone call it's uh going
 
02:04:18.870 --> 02:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
to cost 10 or 15 cents I'll hand them
 
02:04:20.830 --> 02:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
the time or quarter if they need it but
 
02:04:22.189 --> 02:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
it that's all it is and they're going to
 
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
call Homeland and say is this a bad
 
02:04:26.750 --> 02:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
ombre is this someone we need to deport
 
02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
if it is we're not we're not asking the
 
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
police to go enforce federal laws that
 
02:04:32.709 --> 02:04:32.719 align:start position:0%
is not at all what we're asking we're
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
telling them can you cooperate these
 
02:04:37.149 --> 02:04:37.159 align:start position:0%
towns and these two ordinances do not
 
02:04:38.830 --> 02:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
cooperate with the federal government in
 
02:04:40.910 --> 02:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
the detainer notice so if there's a
 
02:04:43.470 --> 02:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
detainer notice they make the phone
 
02:04:46.830 --> 02:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
call it's a DI Minimus cost at Best they
 
02:04:48.910 --> 02:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
were they hadn't gone out we're not
 
02:04:51.149 --> 02:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
hunting anyone down it's if they find
 
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
out in the middle of an arrest that the
 
02:04:55.950 --> 02:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
person is wanted by one of the federal
 
02:04:58.229 --> 02:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
agencies make the phone call and if they
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
say it's no one we're interested in
 
02:05:02.270 --> 02:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
they're most a lot of the time they're
 
02:05:04.350 --> 02:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
going to say it's an inconsequential
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
person there's no risk at all and they
 
02:05:08.189 --> 02:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
will probably just release that person
 
02:05:10.709 --> 02:05:10.719 align:start position:0%
if they say no that's the next to 911
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
terrorists we have him on a watch list
 
02:05:14.589 --> 02:05:14.599 align:start position:0%
he snuck over the Border we have
 
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
pictures of him then they they have the
 
02:05:19.109 --> 02:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
option then to come pick them up the
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
detainer not they can only hold the
 
02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
person for 24 hours so there would have
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
to be a federal detainer notice that was
 
02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
issued um Homeland ice they have to have
 
02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe this person is
 
02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
subject to Federal prosecution
 
02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
so the other part would be that
 
02:05:40.549 --> 02:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
maybe people argue that it's going to be
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
a big expense what if we have to house
 
02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
them for the 24-hour period actually
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
there's a federal facility in Dover um I
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
talked to the governor's security guards
 
02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
I was asking about this I said your
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
state Troopers and they said oh in the
 
02:05:54.669 --> 02:05:54.679 align:start position:0%
past what we've done is we just dropped
 
02:05:56.910 --> 02:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
them off and over um and then we were
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
done with it so the costs are very small
 
02:06:01.350 --> 02:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
a brief detention you're probably
 
02:06:02.990 --> 02:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
already detaining them on the state
 
02:06:06.310 --> 02:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
charge anyways so we don't feel it's a
 
02:06:08.350 --> 02:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
burden on the police we're not forcing
 
02:06:12.589 --> 02:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
them to do anything big um they did have
 
02:06:14.830 --> 02:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh some of the Cities again we're we
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
have two different worlds in some ways
 
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
because my suburbs have probably
 
02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
different feelings than the cities uh
 
02:06:23.189 --> 02:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester and some of we'll
 
02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
just say the more blue leaning cities
 
02:06:27.310 --> 02:06:27.320 align:start position:0%
have signed they signed and said they're
 
02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
against this bill but then I've talked
 
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
to some of them and I got the Manchester
 
02:06:32.430 --> 02:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
Police Department to give me their
 
02:06:34.629 --> 02:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
operating procedure and their operating
 
02:06:36.510 --> 02:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
procedure says that they will cooperate
 
02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
with federal agencies and they're not
 
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
bed by this um so if they follow their
 
02:06:43.549 --> 02:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
operating procedures their procedures
 
02:06:45.270 --> 02:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
say cooperate with the federal
 
02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
government so was it political in this
 
02:06:50.790 --> 02:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
sheet that they come up with 12 towns
 
02:06:54.109 --> 02:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
I'll talk to my uh I've talked to a lot
 
02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
of people in law enforcement in my area
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
be they local they're mostly local
 
02:07:00.950 --> 02:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs and they say they have
 
02:07:03.189 --> 02:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
done this my own Chief and Sandown said
 
02:07:04.990 --> 02:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
over the last 20 years he's had three or
 
02:07:07.109 --> 02:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
four stops he's called ice or Homeland
 
02:07:08.830 --> 02:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
once or twice they've come and picked
 
02:07:10.910 --> 02:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
the person up there was no major expense
 
02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
to him or my town
 
02:07:17.069 --> 02:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
and uh I I didn't want to read you my
 
02:07:18.549 --> 02:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
testimony that it didn't the Senate so
 
02:07:20.870 --> 02:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's just been going off the top of my
 
02:07:23.589 --> 02:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
head here so I should probably slow down
 
02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
and um again it's it's the safety is the
 
02:07:28.750 --> 02:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
public safety is our biggest issue if
 
02:07:30.430 --> 02:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
they were vetted and we had a smaller
 
02:07:33.310 --> 02:07:33.320 align:start position:0%
crowd coming in it would be one thing
 
02:07:35.149 --> 02:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
but we don't again we have people who
 
02:07:38.109 --> 02:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
have been bad actors in our communities
 
02:07:40.629 --> 02:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
already I just read you the tip of the
 
02:07:42.270 --> 02:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
iceberg of what I could have in the last
 
02:07:44.030 --> 02:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
four years of people who have come into
 
02:07:46.149 --> 02:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who shouldn't be here
 
02:07:48.430 --> 02:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
again this in the North in the Canadian
 
02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
border we had he was a coyote it was the
 
02:07:53.149 --> 02:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
second time trying to run people in he
 
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
had been caught in 2011 who knows how
 
02:07:57.390 --> 02:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
many times he wasn't caught this was I
 
02:07:59.629 --> 02:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
believe last fall and I'm not saying I'm
 
02:08:01.629 --> 02:08:01.639 align:start position:0%
not a particular big one on the Canadian
 
02:08:03.669 --> 02:08:03.679 align:start position:0%
border my biggest thing is just in
 
02:08:06.629 --> 02:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
general some people are specific and are
 
02:08:08.790 --> 02:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
very into the Canadian part I believe
 
02:08:10.109 --> 02:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
most of
 
02:08:13.629 --> 02:08:13.639 align:start position:0%
our illegal immigration is coming from
 
02:08:15.310 --> 02:08:15.320 align:start position:0%
the south they're being bust up to
 
02:08:18.189 --> 02:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
Boston or something and and again is it
 
02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
as big a problem here as it is as you go
 
02:08:23.790 --> 02:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
south no but once people who are get
 
02:08:26.229 --> 02:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
into our country again I believe every
 
02:08:29.470 --> 02:08:29.480 align:start position:0%
state is now a border state subject to
 
02:08:31.149 --> 02:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
these people someone could go anywhere
 
02:08:34.310 --> 02:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
in our country uh travel is very easy
 
02:08:36.510 --> 02:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
and we would rather New Hampshire not
 
02:08:39.149 --> 02:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
become a sanctuary State and I think
 
02:08:39.159 --> 02:08:41.549 align:start position:0%
become a sanctuary State and I think
that's

02:08:41.549 --> 02:08:41.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
enough thank you any
 
02:08:46.750 --> 02:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
questions Senator with regard to the the
 
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
towns you mentioned um like I think you
 
02:08:51.669 --> 02:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
said Lebanon
 
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
so is it the current policy on your
 
02:08:56.069 --> 02:08:56.079 align:start position:0%
understanding that if they're booking
 
02:08:58.910 --> 02:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
someone for a New Hampshire crime and
 
02:09:01.870 --> 02:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
there's an ice detainer say for rape
 
02:09:04.510 --> 02:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
that they're not allowed to call ICE oh
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
under provision seven I just happened to
 
02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
pick one town over the other here
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
Lebanon uh no AG I can leave you these
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
no agent or agency of the city of
 
02:09:15.870 --> 02:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
Lebanon including law enforcement shall
 
02:09:18.870 --> 02:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
cooperate or participate in Immigration
 
02:09:20.870 --> 02:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions as an agency
 
02:09:23.310 --> 02:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
authorized communicate with the federal
 
02:09:25.390 --> 02:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
immigrations yeah it's very clear that
 
02:09:27.229 --> 02:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
they're being told not to cooperate not
 
02:09:29.109 --> 02:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
to make the phone call not to do any
 
02:09:30.990 --> 02:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
affirmative action so again we don't
 
02:09:33.189 --> 02:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
want them enforcing federal law we just
 
02:09:35.189 --> 02:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
want them to cooperate and we think the
 
02:09:38.350 --> 02:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
cost will be di Minimus thank you
 
02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:39.669 align:start position:0%
cost will be di Minimus thank you
further

02:09:39.669 --> 02:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:09:42.629 --> 02:09:42.639 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:09:45.790 --> 02:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
Muse do we actually have any statistical
 
02:09:49.149 --> 02:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
evidence of how many crimes are actually
 
02:09:50.709 --> 02:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
being committed by people who are
 
02:09:50.719 --> 02:09:52.109 align:start position:0%
being committed by people who are
undocumented

02:09:52.109 --> 02:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
undocumented
 
02:09:54.149 --> 02:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
and how that actually compares to those
 
02:09:57.069 --> 02:09:57.079 align:start position:0%
of us who have lived here all our lives
 
02:09:59.990 --> 02:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah Senator Whitley has interesting
 
02:10:01.669 --> 02:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
statistics and she will tell you that an
 
02:10:03.549 --> 02:10:03.559 align:start position:0%
American is three times more likely to
 
02:10:06.270 --> 02:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
commit a crime but I can explain why her
 
02:10:07.950 --> 02:10:07.960 align:start position:0%
statistics are
 
02:10:10.549 --> 02:10:10.559 align:start position:0%
flawed they do not look into the fact
 
02:10:12.430 --> 02:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
that a lot of a lot of cities have been
 
02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:14.639 align:start position:0%
aware for years if if they go to
 
02:10:16.350 --> 02:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
prosecute someone in a courtroom they
 
02:10:18.549 --> 02:10:18.559 align:start position:0%
will be deported because ice will come
 
02:10:20.549 --> 02:10:20.559 align:start position:0%
they in Boston they will release them
 
02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
out the back door it's anecdotal
 
02:10:24.790 --> 02:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
evidence I don't have specific cases but
 
02:10:27.549 --> 02:10:27.559 align:start position:0%
yes around the country your BL states do
 
02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
not want to keep records of and they let
 
02:10:31.669 --> 02:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
people out who are charged because they
 
02:10:33.549 --> 02:10:33.559 align:start position:0%
know if they go for a felony charge or
 
02:10:35.589 --> 02:10:35.599 align:start position:0%
something ice will show up and Deport
 
02:10:38.229 --> 02:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
the people so the records aren't really
 
02:10:41.310 --> 02:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
kept as far as how many they let them
 
02:10:43.069 --> 02:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
out the back door so there's there're
 
02:10:45.189 --> 02:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
statistically now because I don't think
 
02:10:47.149 --> 02:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
anyone would believe I'm not saying they
 
02:10:48.669 --> 02:10:48.679 align:start position:0%
these people are better or
 
02:10:50.910 --> 02:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
worse but they're not being charged with
 
02:10:52.709 --> 02:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
the crimes that would get them deported
 
02:10:54.709 --> 02:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
because the judges are aware that this
 
02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
deportation will result that Homeland
 
02:10:59.589 --> 02:10:59.599 align:start position:0%
will show up that ice will show up so
 
02:11:01.350 --> 02:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
they release them before they these
 
02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
things happen just like they're told to
 
02:11:05.430 --> 02:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
in Lebanon and Hanover they're told to
 
02:11:07.390 --> 02:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
not cooperate not to make those phone
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
calls followup follow up so I didn't
 
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
hear anything in there about uh any
 
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
evidence so I don't have statistical
 
02:11:18.390 --> 02:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
evidence one way or another that they do
 
02:11:20.589 --> 02:11:20.599 align:start position:0%
more or less crimes but the statistical
 
02:11:22.510 --> 02:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
evidence that was released in the Senate
 
02:11:24.350 --> 02:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
was flawed evidence because Senator
 
02:11:29.790 --> 02:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:33.229 --> 02:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
forward represent n thank you Mr chair
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
02:11:36.629 --> 02:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
thanks for talking to me um I'm
 
02:11:39.709 --> 02:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
wondering okay so I see um on page three
 
02:11:41.229 --> 02:11:41.239 align:start position:0%
uh starting at line 10 the section does
 
02:11:43.589 --> 02:11:43.599 align:start position:0%
not authorize law enforcement uh a law
 
02:11:45.750 --> 02:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency to detain an alien
 
02:11:48.189 --> 02:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
unlaw unlawfully present in the United
 
02:11:50.310 --> 02:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
States pursuant to immigration detainer
 
02:11:52.189 --> 02:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
solely because the witness reported a
 
02:11:53.950 --> 02:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
crime or was a victim of a criminal
 
02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
offense and it goes it continues on to
 
02:11:57.750 --> 02:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
talk about domestic violence to talk
 
02:12:00.030 --> 02:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
about rape sexual exploitation sexual
 
02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
assault these are um commonly used when
 
02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
people are um in support of sanctuary
 
02:12:09.229 --> 02:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
cities um this uh you know this
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
reasoning is commonly used as people
 
02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
will not be able to report a crime will
 
02:12:15.270 --> 02:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
not um feel comfortable interacting with
 
02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
law enforcement if they have the threat
 
02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
of something like this do you feel like
 
02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
having this section in there um would
 
02:12:24.030 --> 02:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
negate people's uh fear in in uh
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
interacting with law enforcement yeah so
 
02:12:28.229 --> 02:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
I there is somewhere in there I have to
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
I haven't read it in a few weeks I
 
02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
apologize but there is a section saying
 
02:12:34.430 --> 02:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
that if you report it was to uh we had a
 
02:12:36.149 --> 02:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
lot of Brazilian Community from
 
02:12:38.430 --> 02:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
Nashville come to our hearing and um it
 
02:12:39.790 --> 02:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
was pointed out to them and they came
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
and met with me after that if you do
 
02:12:43.709 --> 02:12:43.719 align:start position:0%
report a crime that that you'll even be
 
02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
helped to work towards you have like a
 
02:12:47.669 --> 02:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
two-year period that they will not
 
02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
report you to homelander ice and they'll
 
02:12:52.109 --> 02:12:52.119 align:start position:0%
even try to help you get citizenship if
 
02:12:54.510 --> 02:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
you report a crime so it's to get people
 
02:12:57.270 --> 02:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
not to be scared of reporting so they
 
02:12:58.990 --> 02:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
are covered there but I I will have to
 
02:13:04.270 --> 02:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:07.280 align:start position:0%

to drop them off and do if they call
 
02:13:37.229 --> 02:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
Homeland call ICE let them know that's

to let we would like them to cooperate
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
is to the best of their efforts it
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they're going to hunt down
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
dishwashers and in Portsmith uh Senator
 
02:13:49.750 --> 02:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
Perkins qu always it's like I'm a

immigrants Community just as safe as us
 
02:14:01.990 --> 02:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
and so we we do have Provisions in the
 
02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
bill to assist people
 
02:14:08.750 --> 02:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
who talk to let law enforcement know
 
02:14:10.270 --> 02:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
that there have crimes have been
 
02:14:13.030 --> 02:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and again best efforts will
 
02:14:15.790 --> 02:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
not be you might hear that it's going to
 
02:14:18.069 --> 02:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
be cost a lot of money again you make
 
02:14:20.189 --> 02:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
that phone call is all we're asking for
 
02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
detain them in jail for whatever brief
 
02:14:24.109 --> 02:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
period that is or if you can't do that
 
02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
drop them off in do at the federal
 
02:14:29.589 --> 02:14:29.599 align:start position:0%
facility follow
 
02:14:29.599 --> 02:14:31.109 align:start position:0%
facility follow
follow

02:14:31.109 --> 02:14:31.119 align:start position:0%
follow
 
02:14:33.709 --> 02:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
today if someone's arrested doesn't
 
02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
matter who they are but if they believe
 
02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
that this immigrant that's arrested and
 
02:14:42.030 --> 02:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
they're booked do not they already know
 
02:14:45.910 --> 02:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
if Isaac has um paperwork out for them
 
02:14:47.430 --> 02:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
yeah they would know if they run the
 
02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
name through and someone gave their
 
02:14:51.470 --> 02:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
right name they and it pops up that
 
02:14:53.350 --> 02:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
they're wanted by Ice yes they would
 
02:14:55.069 --> 02:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
know and we want the police then to make
 
02:14:58.510 --> 02:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
that phone call okay follow up one last
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
one follow up on the followup okay so
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
but what you're asking is that our law
 
02:15:07.790 --> 02:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
enforcements do the work of Isaac by
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
making that call I'm not asking them to
 
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
go out and arrest anyone I'm not asking
 
02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
them to spend or use any resources other
 
02:15:17.910 --> 02:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
than you've encountered someone you were
 
02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
doing with the state offense you've
 
02:15:22.069 --> 02:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
arrested them brought them in and you
 
02:15:23.589 --> 02:15:23.599 align:start position:0%
know that they're you know they've
 
02:15:25.589 --> 02:15:25.599 align:start position:0%
either told you somehow you ran their
 
02:15:27.430 --> 02:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
name and it came up on homeland so
 
02:15:28.750 --> 02:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
you're aware and now you're going to
 
02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:29.750 align:start position:0%
you're aware and now you're going to
inform

02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
inform
 
02:15:33.229 --> 02:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
Homeland we have Bill Ganon in custody
 
02:15:35.109 --> 02:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
would you like to come pick them up and
 
02:15:37.709 --> 02:15:37.719 align:start position:0%
if they say no you release
 
02:15:40.870 --> 02:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
them who next thank you further
 
02:15:47.069 --> 02:15:47.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
Muse one of the things that the bill uh
 
02:15:52.229 --> 02:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
seems to require is for police officers
 
02:15:55.589 --> 02:15:55.599 align:start position:0%
to make uh best efforts uh to contact uh
 
02:15:57.640 --> 02:15:57.650 align:start position:0%
immigration officials
 
02:15:57.650 --> 02:15:59.229 align:start position:0%
immigration officials
[Music]

02:15:59.229 --> 02:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:16:02.709 --> 02:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that I'm curious
 
02:16:04.750 --> 02:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
about is you you seem to say that's
 
02:16:08.350 --> 02:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
limited to just making a phone call I
 
02:16:11.229 --> 02:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
mean and and best efforts really isn't
 
02:16:15.030 --> 02:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
defined in the bill in any way um so is
 
02:16:16.990 --> 02:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
this sort of a thing where we just sort
 
02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
of make it up as we go along depending
 
02:16:20.430 --> 02:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
on what the situation is or do you think
 
02:16:22.270 --> 02:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
we actually need to have some real
 
02:16:25.149 --> 02:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
standards uh in the bill around what
 
02:16:25.159 --> 02:16:26.189 align:start position:0%
standards uh in the bill around what
actually

02:16:26.189 --> 02:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
constitute best efforts well if you look
 
02:16:32.190 --> 02:16:32.200 align:start position:0%
at Lebanon and Hanover's or ordinances
 
02:16:34.469 --> 02:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
they are very clear that would be a case
 
02:16:37.230 --> 02:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
of worst efforts do not cooperate do not
 
02:16:39.629 --> 02:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
make a phone call do not hold them do
 
02:16:42.549 --> 02:16:42.559 align:start position:0%
not permit the immigration authority to
 
02:16:44.309 --> 02:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh to talk to the person who's being
 
02:16:46.549 --> 02:16:46.559 align:start position:0%
detained do not let the federal
 
02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
immigrations even in your facility is
 
02:16:52.230 --> 02:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
the case of Lebanon goes um do not
 
02:16:54.870 --> 02:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
detain the person once they're done with
 
02:16:57.309 --> 02:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
the state charge so that would be
 
02:16:59.309 --> 02:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
totally going against that would be
 
02:17:02.589 --> 02:17:02.599 align:start position:0%
worst efforts do not cooperate at all
 
02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
again all we're asking for is you have
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
the person make the phone call um
 
02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
contact the federal government and see
 
02:17:11.870 --> 02:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
if this is a bad actor that they want to
 
02:17:14.030 --> 02:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
detain because we haven't weeded them
 
02:17:15.270 --> 02:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
out at the
 
02:17:17.509 --> 02:17:17.519 align:start position:0%
border representative
 
02:17:19.549 --> 02:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I just have a question you
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
talk about they just happened to become
 
02:17:25.870 --> 02:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
aware of this person is not a citizen in
 
02:17:28.549 --> 02:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
in whatever the instance is how does
 
02:17:29.950 --> 02:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
that happen does that mean they're going
 
02:17:32.910 --> 02:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
to be asking for citizenship or how how
 
02:17:35.150 --> 02:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
do if they stop somebody for speeding or
 
02:17:37.870 --> 02:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
whatever the crime happens to be how do
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
they tell that they're not a citizen and
 
02:17:42.629 --> 02:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
they should make the phone call so
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
usually so there's a ice agent who's
 
02:17:47.830 --> 02:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
cooperated um he came in last year he
 
02:17:49.549 --> 02:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
couldn't come in this year and he
 
02:17:51.669 --> 02:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
testified that most of the time people
 
02:17:53.469 --> 02:17:53.479 align:start position:0%
you know you're they're probably scared
 
02:17:54.870 --> 02:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
I'm always scared when I get pulled over
 
02:17:57.150 --> 02:17:57.160 align:start position:0%
by the police they tend to tell them
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
that you know here I am maybe they find
 
02:18:02.830 --> 02:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
out at the jail the ice agent from
 
02:18:05.030 --> 02:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
Chester New Hampshire said usually they
 
02:18:07.030 --> 02:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
tell their status right away they said
 
02:18:08.429 --> 02:18:08.439 align:start position:0%
I'm you know I don't have a driver's
 
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
license I'm not here legally and usually
 
02:18:13.270 --> 02:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
it's forthcoming so they're not um
 
02:18:15.309 --> 02:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
interrogating these people it's either
 
02:18:17.629 --> 02:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
come out in Communications they've told
 
02:18:18.870 --> 02:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
they've told the police when they're at
 
02:18:21.150 --> 02:18:21.160 align:start position:0%
the jail they ran the name they gave the
 
02:18:23.469 --> 02:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
right name and it came up it it ran in
 
02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
the ice or the homeland security stuff
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
um so it has come to their attention
 
02:18:32.110 --> 02:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
that the people are illegal I guess you
 
02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
could lie and say you're someone else
 
02:18:35.950 --> 02:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
and you might get away with it but once
 
02:18:38.150 --> 02:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
the police know we'd like them to commun
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%
to communicate that to the federal
 
02:18:42.910 --> 02:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
government thank you representative here
 
02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:44.190 align:start position:0%
government thank you representative here
gther

02:18:44.190 --> 02:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
gther
 
02:18:48.429 --> 02:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chair um in New
 
02:18:50.270 --> 02:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the most part we truly
 
02:18:53.709 --> 02:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
believe in local control not necessarily
 
02:18:56.910 --> 02:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
State dictate what the city or town is
 
02:19:00.110 --> 02:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
doing so obviously there's been an issue
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
from what you're saying with
 
02:19:06.230 --> 02:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
levanon have you had conversation with
 
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
their folks in their whether it's their
 
02:19:11.309 --> 02:19:11.319 align:start position:0%
chamber or wherever it might be I've
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
talked there's one of the Senators
 
02:19:14.589 --> 02:19:14.599 align:start position:0%
represents Lebanon we've had a lot of
 
02:19:17.589 --> 02:19:17.599 align:start position:0%
communication myself and her
 
02:19:20.110 --> 02:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
um and then you're saying that the
 
02:19:22.190 --> 02:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
problem is so we had um in Ry where we
 
02:19:24.030 --> 02:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
had the mass murderer working on a
 
02:19:26.230 --> 02:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
painting crew eating lunch with everyone
 
02:19:27.950 --> 02:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
going out to restaurants there driving
 
02:19:30.990 --> 02:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
through my towns on the way home to
 
02:19:34.669 --> 02:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
marac if you have individual towns doing
 
02:19:36.349 --> 02:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
their own thing you're putting the other
 
02:19:38.990 --> 02:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
towns at risk so if you if Ry is going

Native families all of us are immigrants
 
02:21:39.110 --> 02:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
here some by choice some not um when I
 
02:21:41.950 --> 02:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
was in my freshman year in college I met
 
02:21:45.349 --> 02:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh I was assigned a roommate who was a
 
02:21:49.830 --> 02:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh nice girl from a tiny town and had
 
02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
never met a before in her
 
02:21:54.349 --> 02:21:54.359 align:start position:0%
life and uh as we were getting
 
02:21:56.389 --> 02:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
acquainted I was learning more about
 
02:21:59.110 --> 02:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
Catholicism she was learning more about
 
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
me as a Jew as a New Yorker and I at one
 
02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
point I said after I quizzed her about
 
02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
her background I said do you have any
 
02:22:08.950 --> 02:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
questions for me she thought for a
 
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
minute and she asked me where were my
 
02:22:14.309 --> 02:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
horns I had no idea what she was talking
 
02:22:16.630 --> 02:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
about so I asked her and she said you
 
02:22:19.670 --> 02:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
know all all Jews have horns which was a
 
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
surprise to me because because i' never
 
02:22:23.870 --> 02:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
met any Jews with horns and I knew an
 
02:22:26.670 --> 02:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
awful lot of them Prejudice comes in a
 
02:22:29.790 --> 02:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
lot of ways and whether we're asked
 
02:22:32.790 --> 02:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
about our horns or about our
 
02:22:35.990 --> 02:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
accents we tend to demonize people that
 
02:22:39.309 --> 02:22:39.319 align:start position:0%
we see as other and we do that with
 
02:22:41.469 --> 02:22:41.479 align:start position:0%
people whose languages are different or
 
02:22:43.030 --> 02:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
colors are
 
02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
different it doesn't work this country
 
02:22:50.110 --> 02:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
is founded on immigrants all of us came
 
02:22:53.349 --> 02:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
here families came here immigration
 
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
provides a thriving economy a thriving
 
02:23:02.389 --> 02:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
sense of new ideas we have no proof that
 
02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
immigrants are uh more likely to commit
 
02:23:09.710 --> 02:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
crimes we can find statistics that
 
02:23:12.670 --> 02:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
support us or not but we really don't
 
02:23:14.910 --> 02:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
have any information to that
 
02:23:18.389 --> 02:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
effect um having grown up in New York
 
02:23:20.190 --> 02:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
the Statue of Liberty was a big deal for
 
02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:21.469 align:start position:0%
the Statue of Liberty was a big deal for
me

02:23:21.469 --> 02:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:23:24.190 --> 02:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
uh the poem on it The New
 
02:23:28.110 --> 02:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
Colossus uh talks about that statue as
 
02:23:30.349 --> 02:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
the mother of Exiles that's what this
 
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
country is most of us know the lines uh
 
02:23:36.990 --> 02:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
your huddle masses yearning to bre three
 
02:23:39.070 --> 02:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
but the first line of the quotation in
 
02:23:42.630 --> 02:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
there says keep ancient lands your
 
02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
storied pump we want the ones here the
 
02:23:49.630 --> 02:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
huddled masses who need what this
 
02:23:51.469 --> 02:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
country can provide
 
02:23:53.550 --> 02:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
we need to provide a way to make it
 
02:23:56.710 --> 02:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
easier for them to be here and asking
 
02:23:59.630 --> 02:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
our local police officers to help get
 
02:24:02.110 --> 02:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
rid of them is not the way to go about
 
02:24:10.030 --> 02:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:27.830 --> 02:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:30.190 align:start position:0%
 
good

02:24:30.190 --> 02:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
morning as you may be able to see I'm a
 
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%

02:24:45.230 --> 02:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
southeast Asia I was a participant and
 
02:24:47.070 --> 02:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
frequent Wind And for those who don't
 
02:24:49.190 --> 02:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
recall the history that's the fall of
 
02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:51.870 align:start position:0%
recall the history that's the fall of
Saigon

02:24:51.870 --> 02:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
Saigon
 
02:24:55.349 --> 02:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
I then went to the Philippines where I
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
met my fiance a Filipino woman and we
 
02:25:01.110 --> 02:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
were married when I brought her back to
 
02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
this country we did legal immigration we
 
02:25:06.750 --> 02:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
filed I had to sign an Affidavit of
 
02:25:10.349 --> 02:25:10.359 align:start position:0%
Support that she would never be a ward
 
02:25:14.670 --> 02:25:14.680 align:start position:0%
of the state which I kept for 30 years
 
02:25:18.309 --> 02:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
she was not I supported her I recently
 
02:25:20.349 --> 02:25:20.359 align:start position:0%
spoke to her were on friendly terms
 
02:25:23.230 --> 02:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
still she lives in San Francisco that
 
02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
immigration uh immigrants there that are
 
02:25:28.269 --> 02:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
all legal that she brought a family are
 
02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
insense that we are allowing illegal
 
02:25:33.150 --> 02:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
immigration into this country so what
 
02:25:35.670 --> 02:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking today is not immigration
 
02:25:38.830 --> 02:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
it's illegal immigration it's in the
 
02:25:40.830 --> 02:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
code if you don't have permission to
 
02:25:47.230 --> 02:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:49.870 --> 02:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
immigrant I don't believe any taxpayer
 
02:25:51.790 --> 02:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
money in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:25:54.590 --> 02:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
should be used on illegal
 
02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
immigration if you want to change the
 
02:25:58.790 --> 02:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
laws to make it easier for people to
 
02:26:00.950 --> 02:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
come that's
 
02:26:04.429 --> 02:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
fine but the one question was asked just
 
02:26:06.230 --> 02:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
recently by one of the
 
02:26:08.630 --> 02:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
representatives about crimes how many
 
02:26:10.750 --> 02:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
crimes well everyone that's illegal is
 
02:26:14.469 --> 02:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
already committed one crime under the US
 
02:26:17.670 --> 02:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
code so they're already committed a
 
02:26:20.750 --> 02:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
crime in the chesha county the sherff
 
02:26:24.110 --> 02:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
will not allow his deputies to cooperate
 
02:26:25.870 --> 02:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
with ice unless they actually have a
 
02:26:25.880 --> 02:26:27.469 align:start position:0%
with ice unless they actually have a
felony

02:26:27.469 --> 02:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
felony
 
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
warrant now as a former police officer
 
02:26:34.030 --> 02:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
if you stop somebody they have to
 
02:26:37.389 --> 02:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
identify themselves if they don't have
 
02:26:39.870 --> 02:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
an ID card or a driver's license then
 
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
you detain them until you can decide or
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
find out what their uh actual identity
 
02:26:48.750 --> 02:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
is and if it means a call to Ice that's
 
02:26:51.070 --> 02:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
what you do
 
02:26:55.230 --> 02:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
to not enforce any law as a police
 
02:26:58.349 --> 02:26:58.359 align:start position:0%
officer is a violation of your oath to
 
02:27:00.550 --> 02:27:00.560 align:start position:0%

everyone
 
02:29:02.750 --> 02:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
belongs um and uh the two things that uh
 
02:29:05.630 --> 02:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
we really focused on was um having an
 
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
open being
 
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
open-minded um you know sometimes you
 
02:29:11.190 --> 02:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
grow up in a small uh I grew up in
 
02:29:14.510 --> 02:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
conquer um and sometimes you grow up in
 
02:29:18.790 --> 02:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
a small town and it's easy to feel like
 
02:29:21.030 --> 02:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
um that there is not a bigger World
 
02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
outside of the uh place that you live in
 
02:29:27.630 --> 02:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
and uh you know for uh someone like me
 
02:29:30.269 --> 02:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
to come to the school and um being able
 
02:29:33.630 --> 02:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
to connect with the students and being
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
able to uh really show them that um you
 
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
know to we have to be open-minded um
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
because we're even the people who are in
 
02:29:44.830 --> 02:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
the in the same class with you they're
 
02:29:47.349 --> 02:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
not the same and now imagine if someone
 
02:29:50.670 --> 02:29:50.680 align:start position:0%
who uh lives in California or or maybe
 
02:29:53.190 --> 02:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
lives in Mexico or maybe lives in
 
02:29:56.910 --> 02:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
Liberia or Ivory Coast or um Europe
 
02:30:01.110 --> 02:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
comes to your front door and um how how
 
02:30:03.030 --> 02:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
do you receive that person how do you
 
02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
hear their story um how's your heart
 
02:30:07.349 --> 02:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
connecting with them which was the
 
02:30:08.990 --> 02:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
second thing that we talked on was
 
02:30:11.790 --> 02:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
empathy and empathy is the ability to
 
02:30:14.910 --> 02:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
put yourself in someone else's shoes um
 
02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
which was what we uh we were um doing at
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
John Stark today having these students
 
02:30:24.750 --> 02:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
um be able to get out of the shelves um
 
02:30:27.550 --> 02:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
most of them are coming you know from uh
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
different households um they have
 
02:30:32.070 --> 02:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
different beliefs and I say listen it's
 
02:30:34.269 --> 02:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
okay it's okay you have these different
 
02:30:36.309 --> 02:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
beliefs but right now I need your heart
 
02:30:38.790 --> 02:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
to be full of love um my heart is full
 
02:30:40.469 --> 02:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
of love and this is where we can connect
 
02:30:42.830 --> 02:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
with each other so I'm asking you today
 
02:30:45.550 --> 02:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
to to vote no on this on this bill
 
02:30:48.150 --> 02:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
because it it it doesn't allow you to
 
02:30:49.670 --> 02:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
have your heart full of love it doesn't
 
02:30:51.910 --> 02:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
allow you to be open-minded to the
 
02:30:54.510 --> 02:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
person that's coming at your door and
 
02:30:57.269 --> 02:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
and being able to listen to their story
 
02:30:59.790 --> 02:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
so that's all today blessings thank
 
02:31:02.349 --> 02:31:02.359 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony um
 
02:31:03.790 --> 02:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
before I call the next witness I want to
 
02:31:05.429 --> 02:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
remind everyone although we are keeping
 
02:31:07.309 --> 02:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
you to three minutes if you would like
 
02:31:10.030 --> 02:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
to submit written testimony you can um
 
02:31:12.030 --> 02:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
submit it through our portal email
 
02:31:13.790 --> 02:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
portal and it will become part of the
 
02:31:16.349 --> 02:31:16.359 align:start position:0%
record so with that I'll call the next
 
02:31:18.269 --> 02:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
witness I'm going to have to step out
 
02:31:20.389 --> 02:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
shortly cuz I have a medical appointment
 
02:31:21.630 --> 02:31:21.640 align:start position:0%
but the vice chair is going to take over
 
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
for the remainder of the hearing um and
 
02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to the chair
 
02:31:35.830 --> 02:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
Castello good afternoon chair and
 
02:31:40.750 --> 02:31:40.760 align:start position:0%

Castillo I live in Manchester I'm a
 
02:31:45.070 --> 02:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
citizen by
 
02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
choice um I'm here to speak in
 
02:31:50.590 --> 02:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill
 
02:31:54.190 --> 02:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
first of all uh I heard a lot of
 
02:31:57.349 --> 02:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
misinformation here uh we are not being
 
02:32:00.630 --> 02:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
invaded by anybody here in New Hampshire
 
02:32:03.870 --> 02:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
uh we do not have the infrastructure to
 
02:32:06.590 --> 02:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
House people uh people are not being
 
02:32:12.550 --> 02:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
given money to live in any city um this
 
02:32:14.750 --> 02:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
bill really doesn't do anything to keep
 
02:32:17.750 --> 02:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
us safe I have worked for many many
 
02:32:20.910 --> 02:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
years with different police departments
 
02:32:24.389 --> 02:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
and uh uh to build trust in the
 
02:32:27.150 --> 02:32:27.160 align:start position:0%
community a community is safer when
 
02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
every person that lives in that
 
02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
Community trusts the
 
02:32:37.269 --> 02:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
police uh it is not true that the police
 
02:32:39.510 --> 02:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
does not collaborate with ice when
 
02:32:42.550 --> 02:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
people are committing a crime they are
 
02:32:47.630 --> 02:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
turned over to ice the judges do not not
 
02:32:50.710 --> 02:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
put charges on people
 
02:32:53.870 --> 02:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh just to spare them from I you commit
 
02:32:57.110 --> 02:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
a crime you pay the consequences with
 
02:33:01.150 --> 02:33:01.160 align:start position:0%
immigration and with whatever criminal
 
02:33:04.349 --> 02:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
uh punishment you you get being a
 
02:33:07.309 --> 02:33:07.319 align:start position:0%
nondocumented person here is not a crime
 
02:33:11.429 --> 02:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
it is a civil violation if you reenter
 
02:33:13.670 --> 02:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
after being deported that's when it
 
02:33:16.150 --> 02:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
becomes a crime but our police
 
02:33:19.469 --> 02:33:19.479 align:start position:0%
departments all collaborate with ice the
 
02:33:21.070 --> 02:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
different is that they're not going to
 
02:33:22.910 --> 02:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
be just colonized when they find
 
02:33:25.230 --> 02:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
somebody that run through a red light or
 
02:33:27.309 --> 02:33:27.319 align:start position:0%
committed a traffic infraction and they
 
02:33:29.870 --> 02:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
find out that they do not have a
 
02:33:32.550 --> 02:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
driver's license but other than that
 
02:33:35.150 --> 02:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
every time I needs their collaboration
 
02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
they're there for them we have heard
 
02:33:41.150 --> 02:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
opposition from the largest cities in
 
02:33:43.070 --> 02:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where most of the
 
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
immigrants live from you heard
 
02:33:48.349 --> 02:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
opposition from the police departments
 
02:33:51.750 --> 02:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
there we do not tell a captain of a
 
02:33:54.630 --> 02:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
plane how to fly the planes how to
 
02:33:57.550 --> 02:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
handle the plane you know why do we have
 
02:33:59.790 --> 02:33:59.800 align:start position:0%
to tell police how to do their work they
 
02:34:01.990 --> 02:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
know what's best for their
 
02:34:06.269 --> 02:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
communities this uh Bill does nothing to
 
02:34:10.309 --> 02:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
help New Hampshire this bill is going to
 
02:34:12.990 --> 02:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
make us all less safe because when
 
02:34:15.790 --> 02:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
people fear the police and I'm not you
 
02:34:17.950 --> 02:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
know not only undocumented people fear
 
02:34:19.870 --> 02:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
the police we come from places who are
 
02:34:21.550 --> 02:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
our police departments are crooked
 
02:34:23.030 --> 02:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
they're mean they're the rapist and
 
02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
they're the bad people they're not an
 
02:34:27.230 --> 02:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
honorable profession for the most part
 
02:34:29.790 --> 02:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
like in this country so we come here and
 
02:34:32.269 --> 02:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
we grow with having that fear in the
 
02:34:34.230 --> 02:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
police and that's what we have inside in
 
02:34:36.790 --> 02:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
our hard disk so it takes a while to
 
02:34:40.670 --> 02:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
learn to to trust and to learn that not
 
02:34:43.150 --> 02:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
what we had in our countries from police
 
02:34:46.309 --> 02:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
is not what happens here many places the
 
02:34:50.990 --> 02:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
police are also the arm of the of the uh
 
02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
bad people so this doesn't happen here
 
02:34:55.389 --> 02:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
our police departments have worked
 
02:34:57.230 --> 02:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
really hard to make sure that every
 
02:34:58.950 --> 02:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
citizen that lives in New Hampshire
 
02:35:01.469 --> 02:35:01.479 align:start position:0%
every person trust them so they can
 
02:35:04.469 --> 02:35:04.479 align:start position:0%
protect all of us so please do the right
 
02:35:08.349 --> 02:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
thing and just itl this Bill thank you
 
02:35:09.389 --> 02:35:09.399 align:start position:0%

authorizing state and local law

been convicted of a

felony armed robbery rape think about
 
02:36:10.870 --> 02:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
felonies in the United States and
 
02:36:12.349 --> 02:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
deported left the United States after
 
02:36:15.750 --> 02:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
such conviction so the bottom line
 
02:36:19.309 --> 02:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
is that barring our police and other law
 
02:36:20.630 --> 02:36:20.640 align:start position:0%

state of those who convicted felonies
 
02:36:33.110 --> 02:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:36:36.429 --> 02:36:36.439 align:start position:0%
everybody's first choice I don't really
 
02:36:38.190 --> 02:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
see any reason why this is controversial
 
02:36:40.790 --> 02:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
in the slightest unless you want your
 
02:36:44.429 --> 02:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
communities to welcome convicted
 
02:36:46.590 --> 02:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
felons this should be a
 
02:36:48.630 --> 02:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
no-brainer and I'm certainly hoping that
 
02:36:50.830 --> 02:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
you will

02:38:51.590 --> 02:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
as a coalition we are adamantly opposed
 
02:38:53.309 --> 02:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
to SB
 
02:38:57.230 --> 02:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
563 we urge you to find it itl we urge
 
02:39:00.710 --> 02:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
you to unanimously find it itl our key
 
02:39:02.349 --> 02:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
points are that there simply are no
 
02:39:05.070 --> 02:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary cities in New Hampshire this
 
02:39:08.030 --> 02:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
is We Believe an intentional misnomer
 
02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
meant to generate alarm about a
 
02:39:14.429 --> 02:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
non-existent problem New Hampshire has a
 
02:39:16.429 --> 02:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
full complement of federal law
 
02:39:18.150 --> 02:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers including
 
02:39:20.510 --> 02:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
immigration enforcement who regularly
 
02:39:22.309 --> 02:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
interact with state and local law
 
02:39:24.389 --> 02:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement and they have an established
 
02:39:26.790 --> 02:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
relationship that is working for them
 
02:39:28.910 --> 02:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
which is why you have heard from law
 
02:39:30.630 --> 02:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement leaders from the state's
 
02:39:33.150 --> 02:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
largest cities to say that this bill
 
02:39:35.150 --> 02:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
they did not ask for it they do not need
 
02:39:38.269 --> 02:39:38.279 align:start position:0%
it and they do not want it and that is
 
02:39:39.710 --> 02:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
why they describe this bill as
 
02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and
 
02:39:44.590 --> 02:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
ill-advised the language that's being
 
02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
used to describe the need for this bill
 
02:39:49.590 --> 02:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
to address a a situation of undocumented
 
02:39:52.389 --> 02:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
immigration in New Hampshire is not only
 
02:39:55.110 --> 02:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
toxic it comes from a long tradition in
 
02:39:56.870 --> 02:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
this country of pitting groups of people
 
02:39:59.389 --> 02:39:59.399 align:start position:0%
against each other blaming the other for
 
02:40:01.590 --> 02:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
all manner of problems whether it's
 
02:40:04.990 --> 02:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
housing or employment or public health
 
02:40:07.349 --> 02:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
and it's careless with regard to
 
02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
definitions the word undocumented is
 
02:40:12.230 --> 02:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
applied to many many groups of people
 
02:40:14.830 --> 02:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
who have permission to be here they
 
02:40:16.710 --> 02:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
might have an application in process
 
02:40:18.469 --> 02:40:18.479 align:start position:0%
they might be exercising their legal
 
02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
right to seek asylum in the United
 
02:40:22.389 --> 02:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
States they might have one of the
 
02:40:24.790 --> 02:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
temporary permissions that exist in
 
02:40:26.590 --> 02:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
terms of deferred action for childhood
 
02:40:29.150 --> 02:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
arrivals or temporary protected status
 
02:40:31.309 --> 02:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
so the language and support of this bill
 
02:40:33.190 --> 02:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
not only is intended to generate fear
 
02:40:36.389 --> 02:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
but it's inaccurate and
 
02:40:38.750 --> 02:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
imprecise this bill the the people
 
02:40:40.790 --> 02:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
likely to suffer most from this bill are
 
02:40:42.790 --> 02:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
those US citizens and immigrants who
 
02:40:45.710 --> 02:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
will be targeted as looking like an
 
02:40:47.190 --> 02:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
immigrant and we know that that
 
02:40:49.590 --> 02:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
generates racial profiling and feeds
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
racial bias New Hampshire needs
 
02:40:54.469 --> 02:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
newcomers they're an essential part of
 
02:40:56.590 --> 02:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
our community health and well-being an
 
02:40:58.389 --> 02:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
essential part of our Workforce and our
 
02:41:01.510 --> 02:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
economy and regardless of an immigrant's
 
02:41:03.910 --> 02:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
status in the US this bill sends a
 
02:41:06.830 --> 02:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
message do not come do not bring your
 
02:41:08.750 --> 02:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
family members here it is not a safe
 
02:41:11.429 --> 02:41:11.439 align:start position:0%
place so there are others behind me who
 
02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
will talk about the the legal and
 
02:41:15.429 --> 02:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
constitutional problems with this bill
 
02:41:17.030 --> 02:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to leave you with our core
 
02:41:20.030 --> 02:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
message our letter is s has five pages
 
02:41:22.309 --> 02:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
of signatures Faith leaders nonprofit
 
02:41:24.590 --> 02:41:24.600 align:start position:0%

02:41:27.670 --> 02:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill I also have a
 
02:41:29.389 --> 02:41:29.399 align:start position:0%
packet of data that I think will be
 
02:41:31.790 --> 02:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
helpful to your understanding of the
 
02:41:33.870 --> 02:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
reality of of immigrants and their
 
02:41:36.230 --> 02:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
presence in our state I'm happy to
 
02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:42.030 --> 02:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
have no questions thank you very much

for your testimony thank
 
02:42:02.630 --> 02:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:04.070 --> 02:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair and members
 
02:42:05.950 --> 02:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm Bob Dunn the
 
02:42:07.990 --> 02:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
director of public policy for the Roman
 
02:42:10.469 --> 02:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
Catholic dasis of Manchester and I'm
 
02:42:12.070 --> 02:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
here today on behalf of Bishop Peter
 
02:42:14.710 --> 02:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
labashi to respectfully register our
 
02:42:17.870 --> 02:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
opposition to SB
 
02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
563 when uh I became assistant
 
02:42:22.510 --> 02:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of Safety
 
02:42:25.630 --> 02:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
back in 1992 one of the first things I
 
02:42:27.750 --> 02:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
learned and nothing over the last 30
 
02:42:30.590 --> 02:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
years has changed my mind on this is
 
02:42:33.030 --> 02:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
that the department of safety and the
 
02:42:34.910 --> 02:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Chiefs of Police
 
02:42:37.670 --> 02:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
Association have never been shy about
 
02:42:39.309 --> 02:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
coming before the
 
02:42:41.790 --> 02:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
legislature when they thought that there
 
02:42:43.670 --> 02:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
was some change that could be made to
 
02:42:45.389 --> 02:42:45.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law that would best
 
02:42:49.349 --> 02:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
protect the public safety and so uh I
 
02:42:51.269 --> 02:42:51.279 align:start position:0%
think that it's significant that while
 
02:42:53.190 --> 02:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
this bill has been brought
 
02:42:56.710 --> 02:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
forward uh as something to advance the
 
02:42:59.510 --> 02:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
public safety it has not been proposed
 
02:43:02.710 --> 02:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
by the very people that we have tasked
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
with protecting the Public Safety in New
 
02:43:08.950 --> 02:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you've heard about the
 
02:43:12.469 --> 02:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
concerns of uh what will happen if a
 
02:43:16.630 --> 02:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
bill like this passes and people uh are
 
02:43:21.150 --> 02:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
not inclined to go into to report crimes
 
02:43:23.429 --> 02:43:23.439 align:start position:0%
and that's um something that is
 
02:43:26.510 --> 02:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
significant because if people don't
 
02:43:30.309 --> 02:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
report crimes then it makes it more
 
02:43:32.750 --> 02:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
likely that criminals are going to be
 
02:43:35.269 --> 02:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
able to Prey Upon people that are
 
02:43:38.670 --> 02:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
already in a very vulnerable situation
 
02:43:42.349 --> 02:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
and so as a result uh we respectfully
 
02:43:46.309 --> 02:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
think that the question of how New
 
02:43:48.150 --> 02:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement authorities
 
02:43:50.510 --> 02:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
decide to use their discretion with
 
02:43:53.790 --> 02:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
respect to ice detainers is something
 
02:43:56.110 --> 02:43:56.120 align:start position:0%
that the state should leave to the
 
02:43:58.110 --> 02:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
discretion of the people that are the
 
02:44:01.389 --> 02:44:01.399 align:start position:0%
experts in this that we've asked we've
 
02:44:05.950 --> 02:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
tasked to decide what is the best way to
 
02:44:08.590 --> 02:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
advance the public safety and with that
 
02:44:11.349 --> 02:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
I'll close my testimony thank

we have somebody that has their time to

02:44:52.830 --> 02:44:52.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thanks for uh allowing me
 
02:44:54.830 --> 02:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify in strong
 
02:44:57.790 --> 02:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
support of Senate Bill 563 on behalf of
 
02:45:00.110 --> 02:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
the Federation for American Immigration
 
02:45:03.030 --> 02:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
Reform we are a nonprofit nonpartisan
 
02:45:06.030 --> 02:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
organization that was founded in 1979 we
 
02:45:07.910 --> 02:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
have 3 million members and supporters
 
02:45:11.590 --> 02:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
and approximately 4,000 in New Hampshire
 
02:45:14.190 --> 02:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
if enacted s SP 563 would prohibit
 
02:45:16.230 --> 02:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions from employing dangerous
 
02:45:18.150 --> 02:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
policies that provide a safe haven or
 
02:45:21.030 --> 02:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
sanctuary in which illegal aliens can
 
02:45:22.349 --> 02:45:22.359 align:start position:0%
work and live without fear of
 
02:45:24.910 --> 02:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
apprehension from immigration officials
 
02:45:27.110 --> 02:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
I am going to narrow my testimony down
 
02:45:29.309 --> 02:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
to some key points uh you all should
 
02:45:31.349 --> 02:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
have received my written testimony which
 
02:45:34.150 --> 02:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
is more specific proponents of sanctuary
 
02:45:36.150 --> 02:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
policies argue that enacting anti-
 
02:45:39.550 --> 02:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary legislation like SB 563 will
 
02:45:41.190 --> 02:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
result in public officials and Law
 
02:45:43.070 --> 02:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers discriminating
 
02:45:45.550 --> 02:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
against minorities however this issue
 
02:45:47.790 --> 02:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
has been addressed in the bill itself s
 
02:45:50.429 --> 02:45:50.439 align:start position:0%
SP 563 prohibits discrimination saying
 
02:45:52.150 --> 02:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
that a state or local government entity
 
02:45:54.309 --> 02:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
shall not consider an individual's race
 
02:45:56.670 --> 02:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
color religion language or national
 
02:45:58.910 --> 02:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
origin additionally opponents of the
 
02:46:00.510 --> 02:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
bill will say that anti- Sanctuary
 
02:46:02.630 --> 02:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
legislation requires New Hampshire to
 
02:46:04.670 --> 02:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
enforce immigration laws which is the
 
02:46:06.870 --> 02:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the federal government
 
02:46:08.590 --> 02:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
the truth is this legislation only
 
02:46:10.910 --> 02:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
ensures that state and local officials
 
02:46:12.870 --> 02:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
cannot block or prohibit communication
 
02:46:14.870 --> 02:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
and cooperation with Federal immigration
 
02:46:17.110 --> 02:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
officials moreover there's no
 
02:46:19.269 --> 02:46:19.279 align:start position:0%
requirement in the bill for public
 
02:46:21.469 --> 02:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
officials or law enforcement to comply
 
02:46:23.790 --> 02:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
with detainers issued by immigration
 
02:46:26.070 --> 02:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
officials it also it only says that
 
02:46:28.750 --> 02:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
cooperation cannot be prohibited we've
 
02:46:30.429 --> 02:46:30.439 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about detainers detainers
 
02:46:32.389 --> 02:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
are simply requests made by law
 
02:46:34.950 --> 02:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers asking another law
 
02:46:36.830 --> 02:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency to hold an individual
 
02:46:39.269 --> 02:46:39.279 align:start position:0%
for up to 48 hours so that individual
 
02:46:41.510 --> 02:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
can be picked up by an officer or agency
 
02:46:42.830 --> 02:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
making the
 
02:46:44.870 --> 02:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
request therefore New Hampshire
 
02:46:46.630 --> 02:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
officials are not arresting individuals
 
02:46:49.429 --> 02:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
on immigration matters detainer requests
 
02:46:51.750 --> 02:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
are not solely related to immigration in
 
02:46:53.830 --> 02:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
fact law enforcement officers are
 
02:46:55.950 --> 02:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
routinely asked by US Marshals or other
 
02:46:59.750 --> 02:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies to detain in
 
02:47:02.110 --> 02:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
individuals um likewise I want to touch
 
02:47:05.230 --> 02:47:05.240 align:start position:0%
on the committing crimes at a lower rate
 
02:47:07.269 --> 02:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
um the assumption that illegal aliens
 
02:47:08.950 --> 02:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
commit crimes at lower rates than
 
02:47:12.230 --> 02:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
American citizens is not true we had a
 
02:47:15.190 --> 02:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
study in 2019 of data from the federal
 
02:47:16.670 --> 02:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
government state Criminal Alien
 
02:47:19.389 --> 02:47:19.399 align:start position:0%
assistance program scap that illegal
 
02:47:20.550 --> 02:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
aliens are more likely to be
 
02:47:22.349 --> 02:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in state prisons and county
 
02:47:24.030 --> 02:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
jails than US citizens and legal
 
02:47:27.389 --> 02:47:27.399 align:start position:0%
immigrants in fact in this report in the
 
02:47:29.830 --> 02:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
states examined it found that illegal
 
02:47:31.830 --> 02:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
aliens are incarcerated up to five and a
 
02:47:33.990 --> 02:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
half times as frequently as Citizens and
 
02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:35.510 align:start position:0%
half times as frequently as Citizens and
legal

02:47:35.510 --> 02:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
legal
 
02:47:37.830 --> 02:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
immigrants Additionally the the report
 
02:47:39.070 --> 02:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
found that states with the highest
 
02:47:40.950 --> 02:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
incarceration rates of illegal aliens
 
02:47:43.510 --> 02:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
are also those that have the highest if
 
02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:52.560 --> 02:48:47.710 align:start position:0%

number of non-citizens reporting crimes
 
02:58:33.830 --> 02:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
or coming forward with testimony being
 
02:58:35.790 --> 02:58:35.800 align:start position:0%
criminalized besides the fact that
 
02:58:37.590 --> 02:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
anonymous tips can be given there are
 
02:58:39.229 --> 02:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
already a number of programs that allow
 
02:58:40.790 --> 02:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
state and local police to encourage
 
02:58:43.070 --> 02:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
victim and witness cooperation by
 
02:58:46.229 --> 02:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
granting lawful status to illegal aliens

who add in the prosecution of criminals
 
02:58:50.830 --> 02:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
if illegal aliens provide helpful
 
02:58:53.070 --> 02:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
information to police they may qualify
 
02:58:57.150 --> 02:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
for UTS or vaa non-immigrant visas which
 
02:58:59.229 --> 02:58:59.239 align:start position:0%
in turn would ultimately allow them to
 
02:59:01.349 --> 02:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
apply for permanent legal status in the
 
02:59:03.590 --> 02:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
United States Sanctuary policies
 
02:59:05.429 --> 02:59:05.439 align:start position:0%
actually prevent illegal alien victims

of crime from taking advantage of these
 
02:59:10.750 --> 02:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
programs in addition according to a
 
02:59:12.309 --> 02:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
recent report by the senator for
 
02:59:14.510 --> 02:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
immigration studies the data from the
 
02:59:16.429 --> 02:59:16.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice National Crime
 
02:59:18.630 --> 02:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
victimization survey shows that
 
02:59:21.190 --> 02:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
immigrant VI victimizations are just as
 
02:59:23.389 --> 02:59:23.399 align:start position:0%
likely and in some cases more likely to
 
02:59:25.309 --> 02:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
be reported to police than crimes
 
02:59:28.830 --> 02:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
against the native born ice has just two
 
02:59:31.190 --> 02:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
20,000 employees only half of who are
 
02:59:32.830 --> 02:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
dedicated to the apprehension and
 
02:59:35.510 --> 02:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
removal of illegal immigrants the
 
02:59:36.910 --> 02:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
cooperation of state and local
 
02:59:40.229 --> 02:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement who number about 900,000
 
02:59:42.630 --> 02:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
strong is a force multiplier vital to
 
02:59:44.990 --> 02:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
fiing out those Among Us who wish to
 
02:59:47.349 --> 02:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
cause us harm if isce is forced to go
 
02:59:49.510 --> 02:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
into community rather than the secure
 
02:59:51.950 --> 02:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
environment of local jails many who wish
 
02:59:54.429 --> 02:59:54.439 align:start position:0%
us harm will not be removed and others
 
03:00:01.229 --> 03:00:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:03.190 --> 03:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
cooperation we actually let you go over
 
03:00:04.750 --> 03:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit because we had a disruption
 
03:00:08.309 --> 03:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to take questions if need
 
03:00:13.710 --> 03:00:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:16.750 --> 03:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
Balden thanks for taking my question um
 
03:00:20.870 --> 03:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
in your written testimony you said that
 
03:00:25.950 --> 03:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire taxpayers spend one uh
 
03:00:28.309 --> 03:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
17.5 million annually on expenses
 
03:00:31.150 --> 03:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
resulting from illegal immigration do I
 
03:00:31.910 --> 03:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
understand correctly that the
 
03:00:37.150 --> 03:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
methodology for that study was um just
 
03:00:40.590 --> 03:00:40.600 align:start position:0%
to overestimate the cost of existing in
 
03:00:43.510 --> 03:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and then uh divide that by
 
03:00:46.550 --> 03:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
the estimated number of the guesstimated
 
03:00:48.790 --> 03:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
number of um
 
03:00:51.510 --> 03:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
illegal or undocumented individuals in
 
03:00:54.389 --> 03:00:54.399 align:start position:0%
the state so the methodology was used by
 
03:00:56.030 --> 03:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
our research team they looked at the
 
03:00:58.830 --> 03:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
number of um illegal aliens plus their
 
03:01:02.030 --> 03:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
us-born children um and figured out
 
03:01:04.469 --> 03:01:04.479 align:start position:0%
based on costs of Education cost of
 
03:01:07.990 --> 03:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
Justice costs of of Health Care Etc how
 
03:01:11.469 --> 03:01:11.479 align:start position:0%
much it would cost um each year above
 
03:01:14.190 --> 03:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
the amount that they paid in their
 
03:01:14.200 --> 03:01:15.830 align:start position:0%
the amount that they paid in their
taxes

03:01:15.830 --> 03:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
03:01:19.349 --> 03:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
so it's they we do recognize they pay
 
03:01:22.830 --> 03:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
taxes and or a lot of them do um so that
 
03:01:26.030 --> 03:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
is the amount that it's costing beyond
 
03:01:28.469 --> 03:01:28.479 align:start position:0%
that follow
 
03:01:30.750 --> 03:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
up do I understand correctly that in
 
03:01:32.910 --> 03:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
this methodology you assumed that all of
 
03:01:34.870 --> 03:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
these undocumented individuals are on
 
03:01:37.469 --> 03:01:37.479 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and consuming uh several other
 
03:01:40.070 --> 03:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
programs and receiving welfare uh we do
 
03:01:42.990 --> 03:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
not assume it's based on numbers that we
 
03:01:46.229 --> 03:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
can find out um it is not an assumption
 
03:01:49.590 --> 03:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
there is some Des work as to the numbers
 
03:01:53.150 --> 03:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
but um yeah as far as the the number of
 
03:01:55.229 --> 03:01:55.239 align:start position:0%
illegal aliens in the state because they
 
03:01:58.030 --> 03:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
are not accurate records as to that but
 
03:01:59.950 --> 03:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
it's based on
 
03:02:04.429 --> 03:02:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:07.510 --> 03:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
reports representative
 
03:02:09.830 --> 03:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
Muse can you tell me a little bit more
 
03:02:11.590 --> 03:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
about your organization and and
 
03:02:13.910 --> 03:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
specifically why the Southern Poverty
 
03:02:16.190 --> 03:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
Law Center has actually identified you
 
03:02:20.229 --> 03:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
as a hate group it representative Muse
 
03:02:23.110 --> 03:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
that plea please disregard that is not
 
03:02:24.870 --> 03:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
that is not
 
03:02:27.830 --> 03:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay why isn't that okay representative
 
03:02:30.870 --> 03:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
Muse that is not an acceptable
 
03:03:02.389 --> 03:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:16.750 --> 03:03:16.760 align:start position:0%

hearing
 
03:38:01.070 --> 03:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
for Senate Bill 563 and the committee
 
03:38:04.510 --> 03:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
recognizes uh G
 
03:38:28.790 --> 03:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:31.110 --> 03:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair members
 
03:38:33.229 --> 03:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is jel bisett
 
03:38:34.790 --> 03:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
and the legal director at the ACLU of
 
03:38:37.030 --> 03:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we respectfully um oppose
 
03:38:39.110 --> 03:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
this bill and would uh recommend that it
 
03:38:41.750 --> 03:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
be deemed inexpedient to legislate and I
 
03:38:44.309 --> 03:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
think this is I know I have very limited
 
03:38:45.910 --> 03:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
time and I know we've been here for a
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
while and I'll try to make my points
 
03:38:48.830 --> 03:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
very brief but I think this is really
 
03:38:51.189 --> 03:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
kind of a rare moment where you have
 
03:38:53.269 --> 03:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
groups like the ACLU New Hampshire
 
03:38:55.710 --> 03:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
Liberty Alliance Municipal Association
 
03:38:58.110 --> 03:38:58.120 align:start position:0%
and many in law enforcement um all
 
03:38:59.950 --> 03:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill for many reasons and
 
03:39:02.429 --> 03:39:02.439 align:start position:0%
I think that is kind of an overall sign
 
03:39:04.630 --> 03:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
that this bill may be problematic in
 
03:39:06.710 --> 03:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
various ways and I'm just going to share
 
03:39:08.510 --> 03:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
with you a few reasons why we think this
 
03:39:11.269 --> 03:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
bill is is problematic um first I do
 
03:39:12.309 --> 03:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
want to say that I know that there's
 
03:39:14.870 --> 03:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
been some data um about undocumented
 
03:39:17.710 --> 03:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
individuals and crime um there is kind
 
03:39:19.630 --> 03:39:19.640 align:start position:0%
of a running dispute with respect to
 
03:39:21.150 --> 03:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
that data and I'll I'll make sure that I
 
03:39:22.590 --> 03:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
provide that uh in an email to the
 
03:39:24.269 --> 03:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
committee so I don't spend a lot of time
 
03:39:26.910 --> 03:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
today talking about that um but I do
 
03:39:28.429 --> 03:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
want to to start at the outset I know
 
03:39:29.910 --> 03:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
that there was some testimony that this
 
03:39:32.910 --> 03:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
is you know a voluntary you know Bill
 
03:39:35.389 --> 03:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
you know municipalities you know um
 
03:39:37.309 --> 03:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
comply with detainers they they can
 
03:39:39.110 --> 03:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
elect to not comply with detainers I
 
03:39:40.990 --> 03:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
just don't think that's true um when you
 
03:39:43.830 --> 03:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
look at this bill uh and the intent
 
03:39:45.910 --> 03:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
behind it I mean this is a
 
03:39:48.309 --> 03:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
mandate that local police do the federal
 
03:39:50.429 --> 03:39:50.439 align:start position:0%
government's bidding with respect to
 
03:39:52.229 --> 03:39:52.239 align:start position:0%
Federal immigration enforcement and it
 
03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
does so uh without any training funds
 
03:39:57.030 --> 03:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
for training without funds for
 
03:39:58.750 --> 03:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
compliance and of course without funds
 
03:40:00.990 --> 03:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
for any litigation costs that may
 
03:40:03.950 --> 03:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
emanate from from this bill and and not
 
03:40:06.110 --> 03:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
only does it require compliance with
 
03:40:08.830 --> 03:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
detainers um it goes even further right
 
03:40:10.710 --> 03:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
to state that quote a law enforcement
 
03:40:13.349 --> 03:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
agency shall use best efforts to support
 
03:40:15.670 --> 03:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
the enforcement of federal immigration
 
03:40:16.870 --> 03:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
law now I know that there was some
 
03:40:18.150 --> 03:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
testimony Hey listen we're just trying
 
03:40:20.710 --> 03:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
to get at trying to make sure that local
 
03:40:23.269 --> 03:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
police make calls but best efforts means
 
03:40:25.389 --> 03:40:25.399 align:start position:0%
best efforts it is incredibly broad it
 
03:40:28.590 --> 03:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
is not defined and I think plausibly it
 
03:40:30.389 --> 03:40:30.399 align:start position:0%
it it could mean a whole host of things
 
03:40:32.189 --> 03:40:32.199 align:start position:0%
not just a call but having to hold
 
03:40:35.070 --> 03:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
people for ice at Ice's request when a
 
03:40:36.590 --> 03:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
local police department may not have the
 
03:40:38.990 --> 03:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
resources capacity or ability to do it
 
03:40:41.150 --> 03:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
or funding to do it particularly in
 
03:40:42.910 --> 03:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
smaller communities you can imagine how
 
03:40:45.630 --> 03:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
that would be a significant burden best
 
03:40:47.590 --> 03:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
efforts could also plausibly mean you
 
03:40:49.469 --> 03:40:49.479 align:start position:0%
know ice wants to conduct an immigration
 
03:40:51.670 --> 03:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
checkpoint where they stop everyone and
 
03:40:54.189 --> 03:40:54.199 align:start position:0%
they want you to comply uh they want
 
03:40:56.710 --> 03:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
your services well under this bill best
 
03:40:59.429 --> 03:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
efforts I think a very strong reading of
 
03:41:01.870 --> 03:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
that statute is you need to go do that
 
03:41:03.710 --> 03:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
for federal immigration enforcement may
 
03:41:06.389 --> 03:41:06.399 align:start position:0%
not be the intent but I do think it is
 
03:41:08.910 --> 03:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
incredibly um incredibly broad that
 
03:41:10.590 --> 03:41:10.600 align:start position:0%
sentence because there's a robust
 
03:41:12.630 --> 03:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism as well that
 
03:41:15.630 --> 03:41:15.640 align:start position:0%
accompanies this bill um and of course
 
03:41:17.070 --> 03:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
it does mandate compliance with
 
03:41:19.110 --> 03:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
detainers because if you voluntarily
 
03:41:21.070 --> 03:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
elect to say we're not going to you know
 
03:41:22.830 --> 03:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
comply with detainers that is a
 
03:41:24.510 --> 03:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
sanctuary policy right that is
 
03:41:27.429 --> 03:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
prohibited under the bill and that and I
 
03:41:28.750 --> 03:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
think really at its core what this
 
03:41:30.550 --> 03:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
undermines is the notion that really in
 
03:41:32.550 --> 03:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we know we don't require
 
03:41:35.189 --> 03:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
our local towns du the bidding of the
 
03:41:36.830 --> 03:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
federal government and in fact with
 
03:41:38.189 --> 03:41:38.199 align:start position:0%
respect to the things that the federal
 
03:41:40.070 --> 03:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
government's supposed to do we let them
 
03:41:41.710 --> 03:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
do it and lastly with detainers I just
 
03:41:43.110 --> 03:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
want to be very clear there's no due
 
03:41:46.189 --> 03:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
process baked in them I articulate that
 
03:41:48.870 --> 03:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
um in our in our testimony um and lastly
 
03:41:50.269 --> 03:41:50.279 align:start position:0%
I just would really strongly encourage
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
the committee to read the the letter
 
03:41:54.349 --> 03:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
submitted by many of the leaders um in
 
03:41:56.309 --> 03:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
law enforcement um that have expressed
 
03:41:58.110 --> 03:41:58.120 align:start position:0%
serious and real concerns with this
 
03:41:59.670 --> 03:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
particular piece of
 
03:42:01.670 --> 03:42:01.680 align:start position:0%

03:42:24.670 --> 03:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for taking my
 
03:42:26.030 --> 03:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and thank you to members of
 
03:42:28.389 --> 03:42:28.399 align:start position:0%

03:42:42.070 --> 03:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
American friend service committee I am a
 
03:42:44.110 --> 03:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
longtime granted stator lifelong granted
 
03:42:45.910 --> 03:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
stator and I'm also an immigrant from
 
03:42:48.269 --> 03:42:48.279 align:start position:0%
the Democratic Republic of Congo um I
 
03:42:50.229 --> 03:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
came to the United States when I was 2
 
03:42:52.870 --> 03:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
years old and for the majority of the
 
03:42:54.429 --> 03:42:54.439 align:start position:0%
the time that I have lived in the United
 
03:42:57.149 --> 03:42:57.159 align:start position:0%
States I have been undocumented and so
 
03:42:58.469 --> 03:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
I've heard I've had to sit in the
 
03:43:00.510 --> 03:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
audience and hear a lot of testimony
 
03:43:03.429 --> 03:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
about what quote unquote illegal
 
03:43:05.910 --> 03:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
immigrants can and cannot do what we
 
03:43:07.510 --> 03:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
believe they take away from our
 
03:43:10.070 --> 03:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
communities and I'm here to say that we
 
03:43:13.229 --> 03:43:13.239 align:start position:0%
our our role our work together both as
 
03:43:15.229 --> 03:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
advocates and as legislators is to make
 
03:43:17.830 --> 03:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire a safe and a safe state
 
03:43:20.429 --> 03:43:20.439 align:start position:0%
that is welcoming and a and able makes
 
03:43:22.429 --> 03:43:22.439 align:start position:0%
it possible for all who live here to be
 
03:43:25.110 --> 03:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
able to live here with uh support and to
 
03:43:27.269 --> 03:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
feel welcome here and so as an
 
03:43:28.590 --> 03:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrant I was an
 
03:43:30.149 --> 03:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrant when I was going
 
03:43:32.389 --> 03:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
to Webster School ofer elementary I was
 
03:43:33.990 --> 03:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
an undocumented immigrant when I made
 
03:43:35.870 --> 03:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
the Honor role at Bishop Brady High
 
03:43:37.750 --> 03:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
School I was an undocumented immigrant
 
03:43:40.269 --> 03:43:40.279 align:start position:0%
with my mother who is a longtime nurses
 
03:43:42.870 --> 03:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
assistant worked in almost every single
 
03:43:45.189 --> 03:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
nursing home uh both at the county level
 
03:43:47.110 --> 03:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
and the local level in Manchester taking
 
03:43:49.229 --> 03:43:49.239 align:start position:0%
care of community members and family
 
03:43:50.910 --> 03:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
members I'm sure possibly even taking
 
03:43:53.469 --> 03:43:53.479 align:start position:0%
care of even some of your loved ones and
 
03:43:55.269 --> 03:43:55.279 align:start position:0%
so I think it is really important for us
 
03:43:57.790 --> 03:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
to consider what is the spirit of this
 
03:43:59.309 --> 03:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
bill what does this bill actually do
 
03:44:01.710 --> 03:44:01.720 align:start position:0%
does it truly make our community our
 
03:44:05.349 --> 03:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
state a safer one does it truly uh solve
 
03:44:07.910 --> 03:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
the problem that uh the sponsors have
 
03:44:10.710 --> 03:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
stated is is there to be solved or does
 
03:44:13.429 --> 03:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
it in fact send a clear message not only
 
03:44:15.950 --> 03:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
to Immigrant community members but to
 
03:44:17.630 --> 03:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
Immigrant loved ones because immigrant
 
03:44:21.149 --> 03:44:21.159 align:start position:0%
communities are not a separate uh entity
 
03:44:24.070 --> 03:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
living apart from other residents um and
 
03:44:25.990 --> 03:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state we are part of
 
03:44:28.510 --> 03:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
your families we are your colleagues uh
 
03:44:31.469 --> 03:44:31.479 align:start position:0%
we are in your your schools uh we are in
 
03:44:33.710 --> 03:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
your grocery stores we are part of the
 
03:44:35.750 --> 03:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
fabric of this community and not only do
 
03:44:38.670 --> 03:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
we contribute billions of money and tax
 
03:44:41.389 --> 03:44:41.399 align:start position:0%
dollars uh to the state without being
 
03:44:45.510 --> 03:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
able to access any of the uh the the the
 
03:44:47.590 --> 03:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
social safety nets that some people here
 
03:44:50.309 --> 03:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
have claimed um that IM uh undocumented
 
03:44:52.269 --> 03:44:52.279 align:start position:0%
immigrants can we cannot we cannot get
 
03:44:54.550 --> 03:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
on Medicare we cannot receive welfare we
 
03:44:56.149 --> 03:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
cannot do a lot of things and yet we
 
03:44:58.670 --> 03:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
still continue to contribute to this
 
03:45:00.510 --> 03:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
great state and so I have the immense
 
03:45:03.870 --> 03:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
privilege of now being um a US citizen
 
03:45:05.670 --> 03:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
um but I know that it is important my
 
03:45:07.910 --> 03:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
work is to continue to raise the profile
 
03:45:09.870 --> 03:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
and raise the voices of communities that
 
03:45:12.630 --> 03:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
I come from knowing that not so long ago
 
03:45:14.590 --> 03:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
I was in those communities and we are
 
03:45:17.349 --> 03:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
not talking simply um we need to examine
 
03:45:19.870 --> 03:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
intent versus impact and the int the
 
03:45:21.550 --> 03:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
impact of this bill is that it will make
 
03:45:24.229 --> 03:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
it that much more difficult that much
 
03:45:27.030 --> 03:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
more scary that much less welcoming in
 
03:45:29.670 --> 03:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
our state not only for immigrants but
 
03:45:31.750 --> 03:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
also for the people who love them who
 
03:45:33.750 --> 03:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
work with them and are part of their
 
03:45:35.550 --> 03:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
lives and so I strongly urge the
 
03:45:37.590 --> 03:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
committee to really to consider what
 
03:45:39.790 --> 03:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
kind of state are we trying to be let us
 
03:45:42.469 --> 03:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
not fall into fear let us not fall into
 
03:45:44.630 --> 03:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
the false rhetoric that pits us against
 
03:45:46.269 --> 03:45:46.279 align:start position:0%
each other other but to really examine
 
03:45:48.189 --> 03:45:48.199 align:start position:0%
that there are many ways that we can
 
03:45:50.349 --> 03:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
contribute to a safer New Hampshire but
 
03:45:52.269 --> 03:45:52.279 align:start position:0%
this is not one of them so thank you for
 
03:45:55.349 --> 03:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony I'm happy to take
 
03:45:57.229 --> 03:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
03:46:00.269 --> 03:46:00.279 align:start position:0%
testimony there representative celik
 
03:46:01.590 --> 03:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and thank you for
 
03:46:03.670 --> 03:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you said in your
 
03:46:05.870 --> 03:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
testimony that you were not eligible to
 
03:46:08.469 --> 03:46:08.479 align:start position:0%
receive Services um could could you
 
03:46:10.070 --> 03:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
expand on that just a little bit more
 
03:46:13.710 --> 03:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
for us please yes so absolutely so um I
 
03:46:15.710 --> 03:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
come from a single parent household my
 
03:46:17.510 --> 03:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
mother was a single mother my father
 
03:46:19.269 --> 03:46:19.279 align:start position:0%
having passed away when I was only four
 
03:46:21.189 --> 03:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
years old and so she was a widow raising
 
03:46:24.790 --> 03:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
a child alone and so um Not only was she
 
03:46:27.149 --> 03:46:27.159 align:start position:0%
uh a single parent she were poor working
 
03:46:29.750 --> 03:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
class she worked multiple jobs um in
 
03:46:31.750 --> 03:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and she was eligible for
 
03:46:34.110 --> 03:46:34.120 align:start position:0%
many she would have been eligible for
 
03:46:35.830 --> 03:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
many different services including
 
03:46:39.110 --> 03:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Medicare um as well as Wick all
 
03:46:41.950 --> 03:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
these all these uh uh care packages that
 
03:46:44.990 --> 03:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
we have available to lowincome families
 
03:46:47.030 --> 03:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
with um with children but because we
 
03:46:49.710 --> 03:46:49.720 align:start position:0%
were undocumented we were not eligible
 
03:46:52.550 --> 03:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
for any of those services and that um
 
03:46:54.830 --> 03:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
that fact continues today so that we
 
03:46:57.030 --> 03:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
have even undocumented families now in
 
03:47:00.469 --> 03:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
2024 would not be eligible for those
 
03:47:05.149 --> 03:47:05.159 align:start position:0%
Services followup um and was was your
 
03:47:06.710 --> 03:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
mother in your case as you brought her
 
03:47:08.590 --> 03:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
up paying taxes during that time oh
 
03:47:11.389 --> 03:47:11.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely my mother worked for like I
 
03:47:13.750 --> 03:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
said for all different Nur nursing homes
 
03:47:15.110 --> 03:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire she pay
 
03:47:17.550 --> 03:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
taxes every single year and in fact even
 
03:47:20.349 --> 03:47:20.359 align:start position:0%
I when I was able to finally get some
 
03:47:23.389 --> 03:47:23.399 align:start position:0%
work um I worked as an art model um I
 
03:47:25.389 --> 03:47:25.399 align:start position:0%
know I'm very pretty um worked as an art
 
03:47:27.550 --> 03:47:27.560 align:start position:0%
model I worked at a Chinese restaurant
 
03:47:31.149 --> 03:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
and I paid my taxes my first tax that I
 
03:47:33.309 --> 03:47:33.319 align:start position:0%
uh income tax that I filed was for
 
03:47:36.070 --> 03:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
$7,000 worth of income in one year and I
 
03:47:37.870 --> 03:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
still pay taxes on that so we have been
 
03:47:40.510 --> 03:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
paying taxes for decades as many others
 
03:47:41.790 --> 03:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
have as
 
03:47:44.830 --> 03:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
well representative Reed thank you m
 
03:47:46.590 --> 03:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
Madam chair thank you for taking my
 
03:47:50.510 --> 03:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
question um what do what is the obstacle
 
03:47:54.070 --> 03:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
or obstacles that prevent um people from
 
03:47:56.790 --> 03:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
getting um citizenship when they're here
 
03:47:58.830 --> 03:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
for a majority of their lives it seems
 
03:48:02.110 --> 03:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
easier in my from my point of view to
 
03:48:04.269 --> 03:48:04.279 align:start position:0%
start the process so you get benefits
 
03:48:06.790 --> 03:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
that you contribute to it just sounds
 
03:48:09.750 --> 03:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
very difficult to navigate the system
 
03:48:12.030 --> 03:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
the way it is so can you shed some light
 
03:48:14.910 --> 03:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
on why it's hard for children brought
 
03:48:18.790 --> 03:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
here and go so long without citizenship
 
03:48:20.750 --> 03:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you yes absolutely thank you for
 
03:48:22.750 --> 03:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
that question so I know I will use my
 
03:48:25.269 --> 03:48:25.279 align:start position:0%
own case as an example the reality is is
 
03:48:27.389 --> 03:48:27.399 align:start position:0%
that our immigration system uh many
 
03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
folks I'm sure you've heard the phrase
 
03:48:31.469 --> 03:48:31.479 align:start position:0%
of uh speak to the fact of claiming that
 
03:48:33.510 --> 03:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
people need to get into line you need to
 
03:48:36.429 --> 03:48:36.439 align:start position:0%
get in line don't don't don't uh don't
 
03:48:38.870 --> 03:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know cross over somebody else but
 
03:48:40.630 --> 03:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
the reality is is within the immigration
 
03:48:43.189 --> 03:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
system there aren't a lot of Pathways to
 
03:48:45.269 --> 03:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
be able to regularize your sta
 
03:48:47.030 --> 03:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
so for instance in my case I came to the
 
03:48:50.149 --> 03:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
United States on a Visa um technically
 
03:48:52.510 --> 03:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
legal and then I fell out of status very
 
03:48:55.950 --> 03:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
shortly thereafter and so for decades I
 
03:48:58.189 --> 03:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
there was no way for me to regularize my
 
03:49:01.870 --> 03:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
status um there were we had the
 
03:49:04.550 --> 03:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be granted Asylum our
 
03:49:06.790 --> 03:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
case was particularly complicated so it
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
really because it takes the burden of
 
03:49:10.149 --> 03:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
proof for Asylum cases is on the
 
03:49:13.149 --> 03:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
petitioner right and so there isn't a
 
03:49:15.070 --> 03:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
lot of Pathways there's not a lot line
 
03:49:17.710 --> 03:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
to get into and so that's why a lot of
 
03:49:20.110 --> 03:49:20.120 align:start position:0%
people who are like me people who were
 
03:49:21.590 --> 03:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
on deferred action for childhood
 
03:49:24.269 --> 03:49:24.279 align:start position:0%
arrivals children who came as uh came as
 
03:49:26.790 --> 03:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
children and became undocumented there
 
03:49:28.750 --> 03:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
simply isn't a path forward and so even
 
03:49:31.389 --> 03:49:31.399 align:start position:0%
for myself my own story the only way
 
03:49:33.710 --> 03:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
that I was able to regularize is through
 
03:49:35.750 --> 03:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
my marriage to my spouse who I've been
 
03:49:39.030 --> 03:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
with for 15 years um but if that wasn't
 
03:49:40.750 --> 03:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
the case if we had broken up if we had
 
03:49:42.950 --> 03:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
decided not to get married I would still
 
03:49:44.830 --> 03:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
be sitting here with deferred action for
 
03:49:46.870 --> 03:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
childhood childhood arrivals I would not
 
03:49:49.429 --> 03:49:49.439 align:start position:0%
be a a documented
 
03:49:52.389 --> 03:49:52.399 align:start position:0%
resident representative
 
03:49:54.469 --> 03:49:54.479 align:start position:0%
Bowden thanks for taking my question
 
03:49:56.870 --> 03:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
earlier we heard about this number
 
03:50:00.309 --> 03:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
107 million is what it costs New
 
03:50:04.070 --> 03:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have undocumented immigrants
 
03:50:06.110 --> 03:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is the study
 
03:50:09.110 --> 03:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
includes costs attributed to immigrants
 
03:50:12.710 --> 03:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
being on Medicaid can you speak to that
 
03:50:14.830 --> 03:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
so I unfortunately cannot I don't quite
 
03:50:16.910 --> 03:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
have the numbers I will just say that it
 
03:50:18.990 --> 03:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
costs the state money to have anybody
 
03:50:20.910 --> 03:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
living here um but I think what's also
 
03:50:22.429 --> 03:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
important to look at in terms of that
 
03:50:25.149 --> 03:50:25.159 align:start position:0%
kind of data is how much money do people
 
03:50:27.550 --> 03:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
contribute to the state and whether in
 
03:50:30.750 --> 03:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
tax dollars um locally or at the state
 
03:50:33.630 --> 03:50:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:41.510 --> 03:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
you is
 
03:50:46.750 --> 03:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
this if the Mr Halt and if there is
 
03:50:48.750 --> 03:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
anybody here that wishes to testify that
 
03:50:50.670 --> 03:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
has not turned in a pink card now is
 
03:50:53.269 --> 03:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
your time to do so because this is our
 
03:51:00.149 --> 03:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:03.149 --> 03:51:03.159 align:start position:0%
Bill have another person coming up hi uh
 
03:51:04.550 --> 03:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing me my name is
 
03:51:07.830 --> 03:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
David Holt I'm here to oppose SB 563
 
03:51:09.590 --> 03:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
which is going to make the state unsafe
 
03:51:12.389 --> 03:51:12.399 align:start position:0%
for me and everyone here
 
03:51:15.189 --> 03:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
um I'm opposed to this as a are police
 
03:51:17.309 --> 03:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
across the state uh I'm a second
 
03:51:19.429 --> 03:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
generation immigrant my grandmother came
 
03:51:21.630 --> 03:51:21.640 align:start position:0%
here actually before there was any
 
03:51:24.070 --> 03:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
immigration legislation as so many did
 
03:51:26.590 --> 03:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
unless you are an indigenous person or a
 
03:51:28.790 --> 03:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
person who's is descended from people
 
03:51:30.389 --> 03:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
that were brought here against their
 
03:51:33.950 --> 03:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
will um I guess I would like to ask have
 
03:51:35.950 --> 03:51:35.960 align:start position:0%
you been out in our community lately you
 
03:51:37.870 --> 03:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
can't walk five feet without seeing a
 
03:51:39.990 --> 03:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
help wanted sign there is a labor
 
03:51:42.110 --> 03:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
shortage and we need immigrants to work
 
03:51:44.070 --> 03:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
and many do jobs that no one else will
 
03:51:44.080 --> 03:51:45.070 align:start position:0%
and many do jobs that no one else will
do

03:51:45.070 --> 03:51:45.080 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:51:46.750 --> 03:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh without immigrations New Hampshire's
 
03:51:49.149 --> 03:51:49.159 align:start position:0%
populations would have shrunk last
 
03:51:52.070 --> 03:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
year um along the same line there's a
 
03:51:54.389 --> 03:51:54.399 align:start position:0%
housing shortage and who are the people
 
03:51:56.469 --> 03:51:56.479 align:start position:0%
that work in construction it's mostly
 
03:52:00.429 --> 03:52:00.439 align:start position:0%
immigrants um and the problem is
 
03:52:04.349 --> 03:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
with all of the the anti-immigrant uh
 
03:52:06.469 --> 03:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
actions that are taking place if we
 
03:52:08.550 --> 03:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
decrease the number we're going to have
 
03:52:11.510 --> 03:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
even less housing uh constructed so
 
03:52:13.229 --> 03:52:13.239 align:start position:0%
we're biting off our nose despite our
 
03:52:16.429 --> 03:52:16.439 align:start position:0%
face uh with the limited uh resources
 
03:52:18.070 --> 03:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
that developers have these days they're
 
03:52:20.950 --> 03:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
of course choosing to uh build the more
 
03:52:23.870 --> 03:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
profitable luxury apartments which are
 
03:52:26.710 --> 03:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
not helping out uh any of our
 
03:52:29.910 --> 03:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
citizens um we should all be aware that
 
03:52:31.870 --> 03:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
the federal government is responsible
 
03:52:35.070 --> 03:52:35.080 align:start position:0%
for immigration uh specifically this is
 
03:52:37.070 --> 03:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
planned out so that state and local
 
03:52:39.510 --> 03:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
police can build positive relationships
 
03:52:42.229 --> 03:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
with everyone in our community uh this
 
03:52:44.990 --> 03:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
bill will Foster a lack of trust among
 
03:52:47.710 --> 03:52:47.720 align:start position:0%
all immigrants and bipo and everyone
 
03:52:50.550 --> 03:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
else in our community uh fostering
 
03:52:54.030 --> 03:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
racism and it will make us or our state
 
03:52:57.910 --> 03:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
less safe um one of the things that has
 
03:53:01.950 --> 03:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
come up uh previously was uh about taxes
 
03:53:04.229 --> 03:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh immigrants actually do pay taxes they
 
03:53:06.550 --> 03:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
contribute to our economy but even when
 
03:53:08.990 --> 03:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
they are naturalized which usually takes
 
03:53:12.149 --> 03:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
years and years there is then a 5year
 
03:53:14.149 --> 03:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
waiting period or gap before they're
 
03:53:17.469 --> 03:53:17.479 align:start position:0%
able to accept or receive any uh
 
03:53:21.229 --> 03:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
benefits um the there are refugees which
 
03:53:23.910 --> 03:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
are a very small portion of immigrants
 
03:53:26.309 --> 03:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
that actually do receive sub assistance
 
03:53:28.750 --> 03:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
but it is uh
 
03:53:30.990 --> 03:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
laughable um and then I'd also like to
 
03:53:33.990 --> 03:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
state if you all have a a cell phone if
 
03:53:36.510 --> 03:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
you could just Google uh Fair you'll
 
03:53:37.870 --> 03:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
find that the Southern Poverty Law
 
03:53:40.710 --> 03:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
Center has named that to be a hate group
 
03:53:45.990 --> 03:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's easy to find for anyone thank you
 
03:53:53.110 --> 03:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:02.670 --> 03:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:05.110 --> 03:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
Davis yes thank you I thought card had
 
03:54:06.349 --> 03:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
been submitted so I'm glad you mentioned
 
03:54:08.349 --> 03:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
that thank you uh Reverend John gregy
 
03:54:10.510 --> 03:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
Davis with my partner Susan I co-pastor
 
03:54:12.110 --> 03:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
the Congregational Church in Meridan New
 
03:54:13.830 --> 03:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where we've been for the past
 
03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
30 years
 
03:54:17.110 --> 03:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
and we are one of three Sanctuary
 
03:54:19.309 --> 03:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
churches in New Hampshire and we live
 
03:54:21.790 --> 03:54:21.800 align:start position:0%
just below Lebanon Hanover those
 
03:54:23.149 --> 03:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
pernicious communities that have
 
03:54:24.870 --> 03:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
declared themselves welcoming and
 
03:54:27.229 --> 03:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
therefore must be hot beds of dangerous
 
03:54:28.870 --> 03:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
potential anti-terrorists I mean
 
03:54:30.990 --> 03:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
terrorists I'm sorry I would just
 
03:54:32.710 --> 03:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
suggest that we've had just the opposite
 
03:54:34.590 --> 03:54:34.600 align:start position:0%
experience and I want to begin first by
 
03:54:36.590 --> 03:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
expressing some dismay that we've
 
03:54:39.510 --> 03:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
allowed the language of illegal to be
 
03:54:41.830 --> 03:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
used too many times today you know a
 
03:54:43.309 --> 03:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
young woman from China in our
 
03:54:45.429 --> 03:54:45.439 align:start position:0%
congregation want asked me how can any
 
03:54:47.910 --> 03:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
human being be illegal I'll leave it to
 
03:54:49.910 --> 03:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
you to answer that I said to her no
 
03:54:52.070 --> 03:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
human being is illegal there may be
 
03:54:53.750 --> 03:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
people are undocumented but they are not
 
03:54:55.670 --> 03:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
illegal so I hope henceforth we will not
 
03:54:58.269 --> 03:54:58.279 align:start position:0%
use that language I want to just submit
 
03:55:01.469 --> 03:55:01.479 align:start position:0%
that the this legislation is based upon
 
03:55:04.830 --> 03:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
fear uh and imagines terrible people the
 
03:55:06.790 --> 03:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
next 911 terrorists I mean we could we
 
03:55:08.349 --> 03:55:08.359 align:start position:0%
could argue that in my mostly White
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
Community where people like me reside
 
03:55:12.229 --> 03:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
we're harboring the next uh Timothy
 
03:55:14.469 --> 03:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
McVey it's it's it's it's it's
 
03:55:16.030 --> 03:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
ridiculous in terms of saying that just
 
03:55:18.349 --> 03:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
because someone looks like a terrorist
 
03:55:19.950 --> 03:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
that everyone else who looks like them
 
03:55:21.590 --> 03:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
is going to be terrorists we had the
 
03:55:23.469 --> 03:55:23.479 align:start position:0%
privilege of hosting a Brazilian family
 
03:55:25.670 --> 03:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
in our home for eight months it was a
 
03:55:28.590 --> 03:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
tremendous benefit to our family they I
 
03:55:30.030 --> 03:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
wish I could snap my fingers for a
 
03:55:32.189 --> 03:55:32.199 align:start position:0%
moment and make every undocumented
 
03:55:34.469 --> 03:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
immigrant disappear from this nation I
 
03:55:36.790 --> 03:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
suspect I'd hear a great howl and outcry
 
03:55:38.269 --> 03:55:38.279 align:start position:0%
what's happening where are all the
 
03:55:40.269 --> 03:55:40.279 align:start position:0%
services that we've taken for granted I
 
03:55:41.710 --> 03:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
didn't know until we had Brazilians
 
03:55:43.429 --> 03:55:43.439 align:start position:0%
living with us that for example many
 
03:55:45.189 --> 03:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
Brazilians clean clean the buildings
 
03:55:47.229 --> 03:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
overnight that many of us expect to be
 
03:55:49.990 --> 03:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
clean when we go into the the
 
03:55:51.870 --> 03:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity there our kids play with
 
03:55:53.630 --> 03:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
their kids they are neighbors their
 
03:55:55.990 --> 03:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
language their culture enriches Our
 
03:55:58.630 --> 03:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
Lives as well and I'm sure you've heard
 
03:56:00.030 --> 03:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
from a number of people from our church
 
03:56:03.070 --> 03:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
already saying that uh we would we would
 
03:56:06.189 --> 03:56:06.199 align:start position:0%
urge you to um to to urge your
 
03:56:08.510 --> 03:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill and I want just
 
03:56:10.550 --> 03:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
conclude with uh the last line of my
 
03:56:12.710 --> 03:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
testimony which I'll submit to you just
 
03:56:16.510 --> 03:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
saying that s SP 563 is unnecessary and
 
03:56:18.710 --> 03:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
harmful and does not reflect the New
 
03:56:20.590 --> 03:56:20.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire values of hospitality and
 
03:56:22.790 --> 03:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
Community safety our imigrant friends
 
03:56:25.149 --> 03:56:25.159 align:start position:0%
and neighbors throughout our state and
 
03:56:27.269 --> 03:56:27.279 align:start position:0%
we their friends and neighbors are
 
03:56:30.389 --> 03:56:30.399 align:start position:0%
counting on you to oppose this misguided
 
03:56:33.429 --> 03:56:33.439 align:start position:0%
Bill thank
 
03:56:36.710 --> 03:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
you representative Reed thank you thank
 
03:56:38.590 --> 03:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question does your
 
03:56:40.550 --> 03:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
church receive any funds from the
 
03:56:42.630 --> 03:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
federal or state government for taking
 
03:56:47.070 --> 03:56:47.080 align:start position:0%
in any of our um immigrant population
 
03:56:49.510 --> 03:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
wow that would be so nice no that
 
03:56:51.070 --> 03:56:51.080 align:start position:0%
somehow that questions never come up
 
03:56:54.070 --> 03:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
about offering us funds no it's been
 
03:56:56.389 --> 03:56:56.399 align:start position:0%
quite the opposite actually or or at
 
03:56:58.469 --> 03:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
least we've needed to rely on on our own
 
03:57:00.229 --> 03:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
resources and fortunately we've had an
 
03:57:03.110 --> 03:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
outpouring of resources to help us with
 
03:57:03.120 --> 03:57:04.950 align:start position:0%
outpouring of resources to help us with
that

03:57:04.950 --> 03:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:57:14.349 --> 03:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:14.359 --> 03:57:26.429 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:57:26.429 --> 03:57:26.439 align:start position:0%

me
 
03:57:49.510 --> 03:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
um currently I reside in Nashua at 22
 
03:57:52.349 --> 03:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
King Street but I came to this country I
 
03:57:54.990 --> 03:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
too am an immigrant I came to this
 
03:57:57.550 --> 03:57:57.560 align:start position:0%
country in
 
03:58:01.070 --> 03:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
1972 um as a visitor I then turned
 
03:58:04.429 --> 03:58:04.439 align:start position:0%
around and um applied well my family
 
03:58:07.750 --> 03:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
applied for permanent residency for me
 
03:58:12.070 --> 03:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
and although all of my siblings made it
 
03:58:15.590 --> 03:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
I did not I was not accepted simply
 
03:58:18.750 --> 03:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
because I had aged
 
03:58:21.910 --> 03:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
out I had to start the whole process all
 
03:58:26.149 --> 03:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
over on my own to become a legal
 
03:58:30.070 --> 03:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
resident because I aged out the
 
03:58:32.910 --> 03:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
immigration let's call it Im Just
 
03:58:32.920 --> 03:58:36.309 align:start position:0%
immigration let's call it Im Just
immigration

03:58:36.309 --> 03:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:39.910 --> 03:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
um put me in a status of
 
03:58:39.920 --> 03:58:41.750 align:start position:0%
um put me in a status of
illegal

03:58:41.750 --> 03:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
03:58:44.590 --> 03:58:44.600 align:start position:0%
immigrant and I was told
 
03:58:48.590 --> 03:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
told in so many words that if I kept my
 
03:58:53.030 --> 03:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
nose clean not caus any problems that
 
03:58:56.550 --> 03:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't have an issue and that
 
03:58:59.070 --> 03:58:59.080 align:start position:0%
would allow me to continue my
 
03:59:03.309 --> 03:59:03.319 align:start position:0%
preparations for legal
 
03:59:06.510 --> 03:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
residency and I was successful at
 
03:59:10.389 --> 03:59:10.399 align:start position:0%
that now before I gained legal residency
 
03:59:13.870 --> 03:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
I had no access to any of the privilege
 
03:59:17.389 --> 03:59:17.399 align:start position:0%
of of a legal or of a citizen of the
 
03:59:22.630 --> 03:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:26.510 --> 03:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
because I was an illegal immigrant an
 
03:59:26.520 --> 03:59:28.349 align:start position:0%
because I was an illegal immigrant an
illegal

03:59:28.349 --> 03:59:28.359 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
03:59:33.670 --> 03:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
alien I gained my residency my permanent
 
03:59:36.070 --> 03:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
residency but I was still limited to
 
03:59:37.070 --> 03:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
what I
 
03:59:40.469 --> 03:59:40.479 align:start position:0%
could access as far as um Federal
 
03:59:43.510 --> 03:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
programs and and stuff like that I too
 
03:59:43.520 --> 03:59:44.590 align:start position:0%
programs and and stuff like that I too
accepted

03:59:44.590 --> 03:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
03:59:48.149 --> 03:59:48.159 align:start position:0%
that because I wasn't a
 
03:59:50.790 --> 03:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
citizen I became a citizen and it
 
03:59:53.910 --> 03:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
allowed me or afforded me a whole lot of
 
03:59:58.389 --> 03:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
other benefits that this country
 
04:00:03.750 --> 04:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
provides and I like that I cannot
 
04:00:06.790 --> 04:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
understand why people are
 
04:00:06.800 --> 04:00:09.630 align:start position:0%
understand why people are
making

04:00:09.630 --> 04:00:09.640 align:start position:0%
making
 
04:00:13.070 --> 04:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
excuses for becoming a legal resident of
 
04:00:15.070 --> 04:00:15.080 align:start position:0%
the country
 
04:00:17.590 --> 04:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
in any country you go to I travel a lot
 
04:00:20.670 --> 04:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
right now I travel abroad in any country
 
04:00:23.550 --> 04:00:23.560 align:start position:0%
you go to you have to
 
04:00:26.670 --> 04:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
register being in that country because
 
04:00:29.349 --> 04:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
they want to know who's coming in who's
 
04:00:34.870 --> 04:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:38.229 --> 04:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
for that is their
 
04:00:44.670 --> 04:00:44.680 align:start position:0%

04:03:39.670 --> 04:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
introduce to you today Senate Bill
 
04:03:42.710 --> 04:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
578 this bill provides that individuals
 
04:03:44.830 --> 04:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
who are indigen and charged with a crime
 
04:03:46.630 --> 04:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
do not have to pay the cost of their own
 
04:03:48.910 --> 04:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring equipment if their
 
04:03:51.830 --> 04:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
case terminates without a conviction for
 
04:03:54.030 --> 04:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
any offense and I want you to hold in
 
04:03:55.630 --> 04:03:55.640 align:start position:0%
your mind plea deals until we get to the
 
04:03:57.870 --> 04:03:57.880 align:start position:0%
end of this bill because I have a a
 
04:04:00.590 --> 04:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
suggestion to make kind of on the fly
 
04:04:03.149 --> 04:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
but I I would appreciate your Indulgence
 
04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
um this bill actually came the idea for
 
04:04:06.870 --> 04:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
this bill came from work that you'd
 
04:04:09.670 --> 04:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
already been doing in the area of bail
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
reform um and is tailored to meet uh you
 
04:04:16.950 --> 04:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
know fit in with a particular part of
 
04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know the pre-trial monitoring to
 
04:04:20.309 --> 04:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
pull that out I've actually had talked
 
04:04:22.630 --> 04:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
to representative Roy about the work on
 
04:04:24.590 --> 04:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
this in the Senate so that we could find
 
04:04:26.710 --> 04:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
a way to bring this about either through
 
04:04:28.870 --> 04:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
this one tailored bill or through what I
 
04:04:31.630 --> 04:04:31.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately hope is a broader package so
 
04:04:34.110 --> 04:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
the idea started here um and we were
 
04:04:35.469 --> 04:04:35.479 align:start position:0%
listening I had been listening to some
 
04:04:38.309 --> 04:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
of the experiences from different
 
04:04:41.710 --> 04:04:41.720 align:start position:0%
counties from folks who had been um who
 
04:04:43.750 --> 04:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
had been through trials or incarcerated
 
04:04:45.510 --> 04:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
different counties and as you may
 
04:04:48.429 --> 04:04:48.439 align:start position:0%
remember there was an individual um from
 
04:04:51.910 --> 04:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
straford County Corrections that said
 
04:04:53.950 --> 04:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
said something that really struck you
 
04:04:56.990 --> 04:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
know struck me and it also stuck with me
 
04:04:59.790 --> 04:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
which was that the cost was $5 a day for
 
04:05:02.349 --> 04:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
an electronic monitoring if they if they
 
04:05:03.990 --> 04:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
had if it was a requirement for them to
 
04:05:07.269 --> 04:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
wear one which sometimes which if they
 
04:05:09.990 --> 04:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't pay that physical labor was
 
04:05:12.429 --> 04:05:12.439 align:start position:0%
required I'm not necessarily like I
 
04:05:13.830 --> 04:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
understand that there needs there need
 
04:05:15.990 --> 04:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
to be conditions in place but I'm not
 
04:05:17.630 --> 04:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
sure that this is the best way to get at
 
04:05:20.269 --> 04:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
it considering that this could cost up
 
04:05:20.279 --> 04:05:21.469 align:start position:0%
it considering that this could cost up
to

04:05:21.469 --> 04:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:05:25.550 --> 04:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
$150 or more and for some who are
 
04:05:27.189 --> 04:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
struggling already to pay rent
 
04:05:29.349 --> 04:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
supporting their families trying to hold
 
04:05:31.910 --> 04:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
down one or more jobs I think that
 
04:05:33.870 --> 04:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
there's a tradeoff here where we have to
 
04:05:38.710 --> 04:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
think about do we want them to be in a
 
04:05:41.590 --> 04:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
County Jail what it costs per day to be
 
04:05:45.070 --> 04:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
in a County Jail versus is what we may
 
04:05:47.349 --> 04:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
excuse for that period of time and
 
04:05:49.710 --> 04:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
especially and and in particularly if
 
04:05:52.870 --> 04:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
their case ends um without any it
 
04:05:54.630 --> 04:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
terminates without any type of
 
04:05:57.070 --> 04:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
conviction so I'm asking to think about
 
04:05:59.830 --> 04:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
what that tradeoff might be I would
 
04:06:02.269 --> 04:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
prefer to keep folks who it's again
 
04:06:05.070 --> 04:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate and who can't afford this
 
04:06:08.309 --> 04:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
out of prison with their families
 
04:06:10.670 --> 04:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
working um within their communities and
 
04:06:13.149 --> 04:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
staying connected up until a point where
 
04:06:16.670 --> 04:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
there's a conviction or not U and it
 
04:06:18.510 --> 04:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
just seems this seems to be in my
 
04:06:21.870 --> 04:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
experience both serving locally as well
 
04:06:24.950 --> 04:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
as here is that it's not our way to
 
04:06:27.630 --> 04:06:27.640 align:start position:0%
force the lower income members of our
 
04:06:29.990 --> 04:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
community to do things such as might
 
04:06:32.510 --> 04:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
maybe be phys physical labor to pay for
 
04:06:34.790 --> 04:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
a device who've been charged with a
 
04:06:37.189 --> 04:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
crime and have not yet had a trial now I
 
04:06:39.349 --> 04:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
know this is only one story but I just
 
04:06:41.030 --> 04:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
again want you to think about this in
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
the broader context um
 
04:06:45.630 --> 04:06:45.640 align:start position:0%
I wanted to make it clear and I had
 
04:06:47.830 --> 04:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
already stated this that I think there
 
04:06:50.189 --> 04:06:50.199 align:start position:0%
needs I'm not suggesting that there
 
04:06:52.149 --> 04:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
should be nothing at all but we should
 
04:06:55.349 --> 04:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
consider how to approach this um rather
 
04:06:57.790 --> 04:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
than rather than you know labor there's
 
04:06:59.990 --> 04:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
still if there needs to be some there
 
04:07:01.750 --> 04:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be the pre-trial electronic
 
04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
monitoring I'm all in favor of that it's
 
04:07:07.950 --> 04:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
how is that paid for especially when
 
04:07:09.349 --> 04:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
they're Char they're innocent until
 
04:07:11.870 --> 04:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
proven guilty and the way the bill is
 
04:07:14.349 --> 04:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
written it sets it up so that that
 
04:07:16.950 --> 04:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
determination not of their status on the
 
04:07:19.630 --> 04:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
crime but whether they qualify for this
 
04:07:21.510 --> 04:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
pre-trial monitoring electronic
 
04:07:25.030 --> 04:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
monitoring is done up in front um and
 
04:07:27.349 --> 04:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
then if the case terminates without a
 
04:07:29.790 --> 04:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
conviction they don't have to pay that
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
back I still contend and we don't have
 
04:07:33.469 --> 04:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
all of the data and I understand the
 
04:07:35.510 --> 04:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
county will speak to some of the count
 
04:07:38.109 --> 04:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
representative from the Cy's Association
 
04:07:40.469 --> 04:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
will speak to some of this but I I still
 
04:07:43.030 --> 04:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
contend that that would be um
 
04:07:46.309 --> 04:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
potentially less than what it would cost
 
04:07:49.990 --> 04:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
up to close to $300 a day for them to be
 
04:07:51.790 --> 04:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
in a um in a
 
04:07:55.750 --> 04:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
jaila so you know these bracelets
 
04:07:58.030 --> 04:07:58.040 align:start position:0%
again the the well the electronic
 
04:08:00.550 --> 04:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
monitoring devices they serve an
 
04:08:02.109 --> 04:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
important purpose for somebody again
 
04:08:04.349 --> 04:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
who's been determined that they are not
 
04:08:06.149 --> 04:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
and they've not committed a serious
 
04:08:08.269 --> 04:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
crime that they are you know going to go
 
04:08:10.469 --> 04:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
to trial for they're not a threat or a
 
04:08:12.830 --> 04:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
danger to the community uh we want to
 
04:08:14.349 --> 04:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
put them back in the community again be
 
04:08:16.389 --> 04:08:16.399 align:start position:0%
with their families work their jobs you
 
04:08:18.030 --> 04:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
know support their families and be
 
04:08:20.670 --> 04:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
connected U this is a way to achieve
 
04:08:23.309 --> 04:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
that but again not everyone can afford
 
04:08:27.149 --> 04:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
that $5 a day and you know I have to say
 
04:08:29.790 --> 04:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
um my own you know it's like my own
 
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
Catholic guilt moment is that when I go
 
04:08:34.990 --> 04:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
and I buy my daily cup of coffee I spend
 
04:08:36.630 --> 04:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
just about that and to think that
 
04:08:38.790 --> 04:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
somebody else doesn't have that money to
 
04:08:42.269 --> 04:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
cover a cost like this is you
 
04:08:44.750 --> 04:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
know I I'm starting to think twice about
 
04:08:47.790 --> 04:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
that and my mother has reminded me so
 
04:08:51.750 --> 04:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
again not being found guilty of a
 
04:08:54.870 --> 04:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
crime done at the beginning of you know
 
04:08:57.550 --> 04:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
the the process using the indigen
 
04:09:01.109 --> 04:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
Defense Language um that has been you
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
know there's some precedent on this as
 
04:09:07.750 --> 04:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
well um in in statute and and as well as
 
04:09:10.790 --> 04:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
in the court system using that language
 
04:09:12.990 --> 04:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
U so that we have a that we have a place
 
04:09:15.429 --> 04:09:15.439 align:start position:0%
to go with this so I'm proposing again
 
04:09:15.439 --> 04:09:16.710 align:start position:0%
to go with this so I'm proposing again
that

04:09:16.710 --> 04:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:09:19.469 --> 04:09:19.479 align:start position:0%
we that we set up the system where if
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
somebody at pre-trial it's required for
 
04:09:22.510 --> 04:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
them to have an electronic monitoring
 
04:09:25.149 --> 04:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
device if we use the Indigent Defense
 
04:09:27.990 --> 04:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
Language to narrow that down to that
 
04:09:29.830 --> 04:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
they qualify for this that we're not
 
04:09:33.070 --> 04:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
charging them per day if they are
 
04:09:35.830 --> 04:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
cleared um when their case terminates so
 
04:09:38.030 --> 04:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
plea deals um I hear there's a concern
 
04:09:39.990 --> 04:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's come up recently about plea deals
 
04:09:41.870 --> 04:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
not being covered and how many people
 
04:09:43.750 --> 04:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
plea out and that this could again
 
04:09:45.590 --> 04:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
become a cost for the counties this is
 
04:09:47.790 --> 04:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
very new to me today I wasn't aware of
 
04:09:52.389 --> 04:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
it so I would ask for the possibility to
 
04:09:54.670 --> 04:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
work further with the counties to see if
 
04:09:56.630 --> 04:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
we can amend this because we've actually
 
04:09:58.830 --> 04:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
amended this already once working with
 
04:10:00.189 --> 04:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
County government to try to make this
 
04:10:01.750 --> 04:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
work I'd like the opportunity to do that
 
04:10:05.229 --> 04:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
again if you should so see fit um so
 
04:10:08.429 --> 04:10:08.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time and um
 
04:10:09.990 --> 04:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
I know you have a busy afternoon I'll do
 
04:10:12.309 --> 04:10:12.319 align:start position:0%
my best to answer any questions you may
 
04:10:15.830 --> 04:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
have thank you very much representative
 
04:10:18.030 --> 04:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
man did you have a question
 
04:10:18.040 --> 04:10:20.189 align:start position:0%
man did you have a question
representative

04:10:20.189 --> 04:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:10:20.199 --> 04:10:22.229 align:start position:0%
representative
Muse

04:10:22.229 --> 04:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
Muse
 
04:10:26.349 --> 04:10:26.359 align:start position:0%
hi um I do have a question about um your
 
04:10:30.189 --> 04:10:30.199 align:start position:0%
bill versus um the bail bill which is uh
 
04:10:32.349 --> 04:10:32.359 align:start position:0%
uh HB 318 that just went over to the
 
04:10:36.630 --> 04:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
Senate um there are um there are
 
04:10:39.750 --> 04:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
Provisions uh for the state to pay uh
 
04:10:42.429 --> 04:10:42.439 align:start position:0%
for uh monitoring and pre-trial services
 
04:10:45.429 --> 04:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
for people who are Indigent in that bill
 
04:10:47.510 --> 04:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh but I believe it's only in the cases
 
04:10:52.790 --> 04:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
in in the case of 3 318 it's only for uh
 
04:10:55.630 --> 04:10:55.640 align:start position:0%
uh protective uh monitoring and and and
 
04:10:57.630 --> 04:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor domestic violence cases
 
04:11:00.309 --> 04:11:00.319 align:start position:0%
where people are released so your bill
 
04:11:03.429 --> 04:11:03.439 align:start position:0%
would actually apply beyond that wider
 
04:11:07.229 --> 04:11:07.239 align:start position:0%
for any any reason a person may actually
 
04:11:10.389 --> 04:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh be asked to be monitored right
 
04:11:13.630 --> 04:11:13.640 align:start position:0%
correct and again not deemed by the
 
04:11:16.389 --> 04:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
judge a threat to Public Safety it is
 
04:11:20.590 --> 04:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
not a you know a a higher a higher
 
04:11:24.950 --> 04:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
charge quick followup followup and uh I
 
04:11:27.229 --> 04:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
I just have you had a chance to uh
 
04:11:29.550 --> 04:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
review the language of 318 and and if
 
04:11:32.269 --> 04:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
you have um what did you think are there
 
04:11:34.189 --> 04:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
conflicts are there are there things in
 
04:11:36.550 --> 04:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
there that uh need to be incorporated
 
04:11:38.790 --> 04:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
that are part of your bill so thank you
 
04:11:40.910 --> 04:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
um representative Muse for not just the
 
04:11:43.510 --> 04:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
first question but the second one so I I
 
04:11:46.670 --> 04:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
have and I've also spoken um with
 
04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative Roy about this in trying
 
04:11:53.389 --> 04:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
to um you know in I think that the
 
04:11:56.229 --> 04:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of intentionality between
 
04:11:59.670 --> 04:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
the two of them uh mine is a little
 
04:12:02.229 --> 04:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
broader the the the house bill is a
 
04:12:03.750 --> 04:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
little narrower but I think they could
 
04:12:06.790 --> 04:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
get us close to the same place so I what
 
04:12:09.030 --> 04:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like is for one or the other to land
 
04:12:11.189 --> 04:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
and I like the I I'm you know partial to
 
04:12:14.030 --> 04:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
the to working on the bail reform but if
 
04:12:16.750 --> 04:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
there's if things don't settle um with
 
04:12:18.309 --> 04:12:18.319 align:start position:0%
that in the Senate this would give us at
 
04:12:20.910 --> 04:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
least one piece to work with so thank
 
04:12:23.510 --> 04:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
04:12:25.910 --> 04:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
you this is your sign to please pass our
 
04:12:29.990 --> 04:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
bail bills I I hear
 
04:12:32.349 --> 04:12:32.359 align:start position:0%
you I don't see any further questions
 
04:12:34.309 --> 04:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony oh you're
 
04:12:36.750 --> 04:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
welcome and thank you
 
04:12:43.990 --> 04:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:59.389 --> 04:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:02.630 --> 04:13:02.640 align:start position:0%

Vice chair uh I'm Erin Creed I'm the
 
04:13:06.750 --> 04:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
general counsel for the judicial branch
 
04:13:09.229 --> 04:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm appearing as hype woman for Kate
 
04:13:12.070 --> 04:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
Horan uh but Kate Horan from the New
 
04:13:13.790 --> 04:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association
 
04:13:16.590 --> 04:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
counties thank you so much um I know
 
04:13:18.189 --> 04:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
we've had an opportunity to speak in the
 
04:13:19.750 --> 04:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
past about similar Concepts while you
 
04:13:21.389 --> 04:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
were working on your bail package and
 
04:13:23.189 --> 04:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
I've appreciated so much the ability to
 
04:13:26.349 --> 04:13:26.359 align:start position:0%
work with so many of you um we did have
 
04:13:28.189 --> 04:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
some follow on conversations in the
 
04:13:29.910 --> 04:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
finance committee I know you're you're
 
04:13:33.149 --> 04:13:33.159 align:start position:0%
part of those as well um for those who
 
04:13:34.630 --> 04:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
are coming from other states or from the
 
04:13:36.349 --> 04:13:36.359 align:start position:0%
federal system they may believe that
 
04:13:38.269 --> 04:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
there's a robust pre-trial division in
 
04:13:40.229 --> 04:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire judicial branch that
 
04:13:41.630 --> 04:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen to be the case in New
 
04:13:43.550 --> 04:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we don't administer any
 
04:13:45.149 --> 04:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring and we do not have
 
04:13:47.990 --> 04:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
any staff uh that works in this area
 
04:13:49.550 --> 04:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring in the state of
 
04:13:50.950 --> 04:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is administered by the
 
04:13:53.870 --> 04:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
counties um so we worked uh with rep Roy
 
04:13:57.070 --> 04:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
and others to change uh HB 318 to sort
 
04:13:59.309 --> 04:13:59.319 align:start position:0%
of voluntarily transmission transmit
 
04:14:00.750 --> 04:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
some of those responsibilities from the
 
04:14:02.510 --> 04:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
courts over to the counties where the
 
04:14:04.830 --> 04:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
expertise and the knowledge is um I
 
04:14:06.510 --> 04:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
think the Senate helpfully improved this
 
04:14:08.950 --> 04:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
bill by adding the counties in my
 
04:14:10.830 --> 04:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
suggestion would be to to take the
 
04:14:13.309 --> 04:14:13.319 align:start position:0%
courts out uh and then you will have
 
04:14:15.510 --> 04:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
completed uh the transition over to the
 
04:14:17.309 --> 04:14:17.319 align:start position:0%
party with the most knowledge and and
 
04:14:19.990 --> 04:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility in the area um we do not
 
04:14:22.790 --> 04:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
have a policy position as we generally
 
04:14:24.590 --> 04:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
do not on the underlying Bill however
 
04:14:26.229 --> 04:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to give you any technical
 
04:14:28.309 --> 04:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
feedback that you might find useful and
 
04:14:30.109 --> 04:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
otherwise I transmit you to the counties
 
04:14:32.030 --> 04:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
for more expertise on electronic
 
04:14:34.550 --> 04:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
monitoring thank you Aaron um thank you
 
04:14:36.950 --> 04:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um so just to
 
04:14:38.269 --> 04:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
start at front we are happy to work with
 
04:14:40.109 --> 04:14:40.119 align:start position:0%
Senator Apprentice on any language that
 
04:14:43.229 --> 04:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
she would like to to amend or see uh and
 
04:14:45.149 --> 04:14:45.159 align:start position:0%
I'll Echo aerin's comments that we did a
 
04:14:46.990 --> 04:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
lot of work in Senate Finance around
 
04:14:49.630 --> 04:14:49.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 318 and we believe that is
 
04:14:51.429 --> 04:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
the method that goes forward just a
 
04:14:53.070 --> 04:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
couple of concerns the counties wanted
 
04:14:57.109 --> 04:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
to flag for everyone um so we do believe
 
04:15:00.269 --> 04:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
that collecting fees after someone has
 
04:15:02.070 --> 04:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
been convicted is going to be an
 
04:15:04.870 --> 04:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
administrative burden on someone right
 
04:15:08.550 --> 04:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
now it's done by weekly uh or bi-weekly
 
04:15:10.469 --> 04:15:10.479 align:start position:0%
depending upon the county cuz as you all
 
04:15:13.349 --> 04:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
remember from your study this last fall
 
04:15:15.389 --> 04:15:15.399 align:start position:0%
each County's program is very very
 
04:15:18.710 --> 04:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
different uh to address the straford uh
 
04:15:23.030 --> 04:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
call so no one is forced to do labor um
 
04:15:25.269 --> 04:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
we work with straford County works with
 
04:15:27.189 --> 04:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
each person who is on electronic
 
04:15:29.429 --> 04:15:29.439 align:start position:0%
monitoring to find something that they
 
04:15:32.750 --> 04:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
are willing to do if they are unable to
 
04:15:35.550 --> 04:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
pay back so that could be yes they do
 
04:15:37.389 --> 04:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
have the option to do wood stacking
 
04:15:40.950 --> 04:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
because straford County does cut and uh
 
04:15:43.309 --> 04:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
sell wood and that's a profit to to the
 
04:15:46.070 --> 04:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
county uh you can also work with Special
 
04:15:48.229 --> 04:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
Olympics who happens to be their charity
 
04:15:50.670 --> 04:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
for this year in doing office things
 
04:15:53.189 --> 04:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
stuffing envelopes things like that
 
04:15:54.590 --> 04:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know somebody wants to get
 
04:15:56.510 --> 04:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
outside and was the the sheriff's
 
04:15:59.269 --> 04:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
Cruisers great we will work with you to
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
find something that you want to do but I
 
04:16:03.109 --> 04:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear no one is forced
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
to do hard labor to get on electronic
 
04:16:06.000 --> 04:16:08.349 align:start position:0%
to do hard labor to get on electronic
monitoring

04:16:08.349 --> 04:16:08.359 align:start position:0%
monitoring
 
04:16:10.950 --> 04:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
um and I'll leave it that you guys can
 
04:16:13.510 --> 04:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
can uh read our letter but just the
 
04:16:16.269 --> 04:16:16.279 align:start position:0%
concern getting so most people don't get
 
04:16:17.910 --> 04:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
a conviction most people end up with a
 
04:16:20.109 --> 04:16:20.119 align:start position:0%
plea deal that's not a conviction the
 
04:16:22.750 --> 04:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
way this bill is written and the fact
 
04:16:24.189 --> 04:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
that we have to wait until they're
 
04:16:26.750 --> 04:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
convicted very we hold very few
 
04:16:29.910 --> 04:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
convicted inmates most of them are going
 
04:16:32.030 --> 04:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
to the state prison where we may or may
 
04:16:35.229 --> 04:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
not ever see them again so um but happy
 
04:16:40.950 --> 04:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:43.469 --> 04:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
has did you have a question
 
04:16:45.830 --> 04:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
Representative no thank you madam chair
 
04:16:47.349 --> 04:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to clarify I'm going
 
04:16:48.830 --> 04:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
through and what you had said was to
 
04:16:51.590 --> 04:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
remove the court um and so I'm going
 
04:16:54.550 --> 04:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
through here I got um in line six um
 
04:16:56.790 --> 04:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
shall be paid for by the New Hampshire
 
04:16:58.269 --> 04:16:58.279 align:start position:0%
Court in which the defendant is charged
 
04:16:59.870 --> 04:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
that court is providing and requiring
 
04:17:01.189 --> 04:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring so what you're
 
04:17:02.830 --> 04:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
saying is that it's not the case for one
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
thing um so it doesn't necessarily apply
 
04:17:06.550 --> 04:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
I just want to kind of be clear about
 
04:17:08.550 --> 04:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
things that might need to be uh amended
 
04:17:10.189 --> 04:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
in this um that would make it
 
04:17:11.950 --> 04:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate so I'm kind of looking for
 
04:17:14.469 --> 04:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
different references but the one thing
 
04:17:17.590 --> 04:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
um that I wanted to um discuss
 
04:17:18.910 --> 04:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
specifically is as I'm going through and
 
04:17:20.389 --> 04:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
finding those specific things there's
 
04:17:22.510 --> 04:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
the court shall develop uniform criteria
 
04:17:24.149 --> 04:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
to evaluate and determine so that's kind
 
04:17:25.590 --> 04:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
of something that is the responsibility
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
of the court it's not in a list as most
 
04:17:29.990 --> 04:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
of these are as the the the court the
 
04:17:31.910 --> 04:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
county or agency this is something that
 
04:17:33.590 --> 04:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
is specifically assigning that to the
 
04:17:35.950 --> 04:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
court so what would we be replacing that
 
04:17:38.030 --> 04:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
with great question and I I will turn it
 
04:17:39.630 --> 04:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
over to Kate in just one moment but you
 
04:17:41.710 --> 04:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
had very similar uh language in your
 
04:17:44.149 --> 04:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
bail package and I do believe that the
 
04:17:46.149 --> 04:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
counties asked for that to be changed
 
04:17:47.510 --> 04:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
that it would be the counties making
 
04:17:49.510 --> 04:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
that determination in that instance as
 
04:17:51.670 --> 04:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
well uh you know certainly it's your
 
04:17:52.910 --> 04:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
policy judgment if you want the courts
 
04:17:54.269 --> 04:17:54.279 align:start position:0%
to be more involved but I can turn it
 
04:17:55.670 --> 04:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
over to Kate to tell you a little bit
 
04:17:56.830 --> 04:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
more about how the counties would
 
04:17:59.429 --> 04:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
administer that sure so uh I'll just
 
04:18:00.870 --> 04:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
point out that just because you're
 
04:18:02.429 --> 04:18:02.439 align:start position:0%
Indigent in one County doesn't
 
04:18:04.109 --> 04:18:04.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean you're Indigent in
 
04:18:07.710 --> 04:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
another County and also um because
 
04:18:09.550 --> 04:18:09.560 align:start position:0%
you're just because you're Indigent for
 
04:18:12.309 --> 04:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
a lawyer doesn't mean you can't afford
 
04:18:14.750 --> 04:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
electron monitoring and since each
 
04:18:17.030 --> 04:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
program is different in terms of what
 
04:18:19.469 --> 04:18:19.479 align:start position:0%
they ask to reimburse so some counties
 
04:18:21.109 --> 04:18:21.119 align:start position:0%
just ask for the reimbursement of the
 
04:18:23.630 --> 04:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
bracelets some counties include the cost
 
04:18:24.990 --> 04:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
of the bracelet the software the
 
04:18:26.830 --> 04:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
hardware and the Personnel to manage
 
04:18:29.870 --> 04:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
that um so giving the counties as much
 
04:18:32.429 --> 04:18:32.439 align:start position:0%
flexibility as possible to administer
 
04:18:35.550 --> 04:18:35.560 align:start position:0%
these programs and incorporate each
 
04:18:37.950 --> 04:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
unique feature for those programs would
 
04:18:43.389 --> 04:18:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:06.429 --> 04:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
much is there anybody else here wishing
 
04:19:10.990 --> 04:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
to testify on Senate Bill 578 that has
 
04:19:12.990 --> 04:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
not turned in a pink card seeing none I
 
04:19:14.630 --> 04:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
will close the public hearing for Senate
 
04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 578 and let me
 
04:19:21.670 --> 04:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
see does the committee members need a a
 
04:19:23.750 --> 04:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
few minute recess um before we open up
 
04:19:25.790 --> 04:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
the next hearing or are we good we're
 
04:19:34.149 --> 04:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
um I will open the public hearing for
 
04:19:39.870 --> 04:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:43.149 --> 04:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
591 and recognize the prime sponsor to
 
04:19:55.149 --> 04:19:55.159 align:start position:0%

04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
tell I didn't hear
 
04:20:10.469 --> 04:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
you get hold on one second I think he
 
04:20:11.630 --> 04:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
might be out in the
 
04:20:42.910 --> 04:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:45.229 --> 04:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
wow this representative sub did you want
 
04:20:49.630 --> 04:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
to um take a minute and introduce the
 
04:20:58.469 --> 04:20:58.479 align:start position:0%

I am introducing this bill as apparently
 
04:21:09.710 --> 04:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
our sponsors are not able to be here at
 
04:21:14.389 --> 04:21:14.399 align:start position:0%

questions because I know nothing about

this bill other than what's on the paper
 
04:21:36.429 --> 04:21:36.439 align:start position:0%
but I know that we have some outstanding
 
04:21:41.070 --> 04:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:44.229 --> 04:21:44.239 align:start position:0%

04:22:11.520 --> 04:22:41.429 align:start position:0%
 
quick

04:22:41.429 --> 04:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:41.439 --> 04:23:11.429 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:23:11.429 --> 04:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:05.469 --> 04:24:05.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:07.349 --> 04:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
Senator representative selig introduced
 
04:24:09.030 --> 04:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
the bill but clearly she just read the
 
04:24:12.630 --> 04:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
title for us so um I will reopen the
 
04:24:16.309 --> 04:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
public hearing for Senate B
 
04:24:18.990 --> 04:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
591 and
 
04:24:23.670 --> 04:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:26.990 --> 04:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
Bradley that this is um representative
 
04:24:29.429 --> 04:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
Roy's Thor I just really make fun of it
 
04:24:32.070 --> 04:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately I needed it today
 
04:24:35.189 --> 04:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
so anyway um thank you very much
 
04:24:37.550 --> 04:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
apologize for being across the street
 
04:24:39.630 --> 04:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
we're all trying to do too much with too
 
04:24:39.640 --> 04:24:40.630 align:start position:0%
we're all trying to do too much with too
little

04:24:40.630 --> 04:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
little
 
04:24:43.550 --> 04:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
time so I would like
 
04:24:46.750 --> 04:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
to introduce four committee members a
 
04:24:50.109 --> 04:24:50.119 align:start position:0%
letter from the attorneys that are
 
04:24:50.119 --> 04:24:58.030 align:start position:0%
letter from the attorneys that are
involv

04:24:58.030 --> 04:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:01.830 --> 04:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
this so as I for the record Jeb Bradley
 
04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
Senate District 3 appreciate um the
 
04:25:07.710 --> 04:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify on behalf of
 
04:25:11.229 --> 04:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 591 want to thank all the
 
04:25:13.990 --> 04:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan Co sponsors that are on this
 
04:25:17.109 --> 04:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
bill and talk about the importance of
 
04:25:18.630 --> 04:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
the bill I think anybody that's been
 
04:25:21.750 --> 04:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
following the recent trial knows exactly
 
04:25:24.550 --> 04:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
how important this bill is um my good
 
04:25:26.870 --> 04:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
friend and colleague Karen
 
04:25:31.309 --> 04:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
umberger um filed the first legislation
 
04:25:35.429 --> 04:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1677 as I recall in 2022 that
 
04:25:39.830 --> 04:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
started the settlement process um as you
 
04:25:42.790 --> 04:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
will hear from the attorney General I
 
04:25:44.550 --> 04:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
think later this afternoon the
 
04:25:46.670 --> 04:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
settlement process is
 
04:25:49.429 --> 04:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
proceeding um but there are some
 
04:25:51.469 --> 04:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
significant changes that should be made
 
04:25:55.510 --> 04:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
to improve that process that will better
 
04:26:00.630 --> 04:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
enable um the clients of the attorneys
 
04:26:03.750 --> 04:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
that are here today from Nixon peid and
 
04:26:06.830 --> 04:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
Riley Associates uh to be able to
 
04:26:06.840 --> 04:26:08.950 align:start position:0%
Riley Associates uh to be able to
recommend

04:26:08.950 --> 04:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
04:26:11.830 --> 04:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
that the people they represent enter the
 
04:26:13.990 --> 04:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
settle process as opposed to the
 
04:26:17.149 --> 04:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
litigation process if there are some
 
04:26:23.149 --> 04:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
1,000 cases maybe more um if they were
 
04:26:25.950 --> 04:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
not to settle on a large number of those
 
04:26:29.309 --> 04:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
it would clog our courts up um for years
 
04:26:33.070 --> 04:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
with unknown outcomes um in the
 
04:26:36.030 --> 04:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
litigation process unknown outcomes
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
could mean a huge um expenditure for the
 
04:26:43.469 --> 04:26:43.479 align:start position:0%
state that is not
 
04:26:46.630 --> 04:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
only not able to be determined but not
 
04:26:50.229 --> 04:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
able to be managed therefore both sides
 
04:26:53.550 --> 04:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
have come together um as they did a
 
04:26:55.630 --> 04:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago to negotiate the
 
04:26:59.550 --> 04:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
first uh settlement process and they've
 
04:27:01.590 --> 04:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
come back with I think what is a more
 
04:27:03.830 --> 04:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
comprehensive approach that will better
 
04:27:08.309 --> 04:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
enable um as they say in this letter the
 
04:27:10.469 --> 04:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
improved process
 
04:27:13.269 --> 04:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
to uh to recommend ending the improved
 
04:27:16.030 --> 04:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
process to the vast majority of our
 
04:27:18.389 --> 04:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
clients as appropriate based on the
 
04:27:20.550 --> 04:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
facts and circumstances of each case
 
04:27:22.229 --> 04:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
there will probably be some cases as
 
04:27:24.630 --> 04:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
there is the case currently right now
 
04:27:26.189 --> 04:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
that will go through the court system
 
04:27:31.950 --> 04:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
but if we can um pass this bill as is um
 
04:27:34.349 --> 04:27:34.359 align:start position:0%
I think it will better enable us to
 
04:27:39.070 --> 04:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
manage this process so if I can um touch
 
04:27:43.269 --> 04:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
on the high points of the bill
 
04:27:46.790 --> 04:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
um there is a new
 
04:27:49.510 --> 04:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
definition on the first page of the bill
 
04:27:53.630 --> 04:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
on line 15 egregious sexual
 
04:27:57.309 --> 04:27:57.319 align:start position:0%
abuse so egregious sexual abuse is will
 
04:27:59.830 --> 04:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
be a heightened term that will be
 
04:28:03.269 --> 04:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
eligible for a heightened
 
04:28:05.990 --> 04:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
settlement that's the first big change
 
04:28:10.590 --> 04:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
on line 25 physical abuse would change
 
04:28:14.670 --> 04:28:14.680 align:start position:0%
to other abuse with some of the
 
04:28:19.950 --> 04:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
criteria um outlined on lines 28 27 28
 
04:28:23.750 --> 04:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
and 29 unlawful restraint strip
 
04:28:28.830 --> 04:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:34.830 --> 04:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:38.109 --> 04:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
um there is a change where you would
 
04:28:40.590 --> 04:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
have a cause of action for an invasion
 
04:28:43.149 --> 04:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
of privacy
 
04:28:46.229 --> 04:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
that's lines five and six there's a
 
04:28:49.229 --> 04:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
definition of unlawful strip search and
 
04:28:51.630 --> 04:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
again I'm just hitting the highlights
 
04:28:54.109 --> 04:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
because um this is a long Bill and you
 
04:28:56.710 --> 04:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
can ask questions
 
04:29:01.149 --> 04:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
um so on page three a very important
 
04:29:06.109 --> 04:29:06.119 align:start position:0%
criteria is that um the payout would be
 
04:29:08.229 --> 04:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
payable under terms and conditions is
 
04:29:11.189 --> 04:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
determined by the administrator accepted
 
04:29:13.070 --> 04:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
by the claim it subject to the
 
04:29:15.550 --> 04:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
limitations of the statute so that
 
04:29:15.560 --> 04:29:16.670 align:start position:0%
limitations of the statute so that
better

04:29:16.670 --> 04:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:29:19.910 --> 04:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
defines um the role of the administrator
 
04:29:24.510 --> 04:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
and how payouts would happen um the bill
 
04:29:27.229 --> 04:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
on line 18 on page three allows for
 
04:29:29.550 --> 04:29:29.560 align:start position:0%
assistant administrators I think Justice
 
04:29:32.429 --> 04:29:32.439 align:start position:0%
bradrick um is doing a very good job
 
04:29:36.550 --> 04:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
under trying circumstances but with what
 
04:29:38.870 --> 04:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
I think everybody hopes for acceleration
 
04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
of the process of more settlement cases
 
04:29:46.389 --> 04:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
there will be a need for more um folks
 
04:29:49.590 --> 04:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
to work with the um Justice
 
04:29:54.790 --> 04:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:59.109 --> 04:29:59.119 align:start position:0%
um on line 28 number four aggravating
 
04:30:01.189 --> 04:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
and mitigating factors was already in
 
04:30:06.030 --> 04:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
the statute but um there is new language
 
04:30:08.750 --> 04:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
added about multiple forms of sexual and
 
04:30:13.950 --> 04:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:17.349 --> 04:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
on page five um as I said before
 
04:30:21.309 --> 04:30:21.319 align:start position:0%
egregious sexual abuse would be eligible
 
04:30:25.550 --> 04:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
for instead of a maximum $1.5 million
 
04:30:28.429 --> 04:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
settlement it would be eligible up to
 
04:30:28.439 --> 04:30:30.189 align:start position:0%
settlement it would be eligible up to
$2.5

04:30:30.189 --> 04:30:30.199 align:start position:0%
$2.5
 
04:30:34.309 --> 04:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
million um for egregious sexual abuse
 
04:30:39.469 --> 04:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
and other abuse would increase from
 
04:30:42.910 --> 04:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
150,000 to 200
 
04:30:46.429 --> 04:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
50,000 these new numbers while yes
 
04:30:50.030 --> 04:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
higher will enable more settlements more
 
04:30:52.950 --> 04:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
settlements equals more predictability
 
04:30:57.030 --> 04:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
for the state over a longer term and
 
04:30:58.830 --> 04:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
ability for the State of New Hampshire
 
04:31:02.950 --> 04:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to manage its budget and meet
 
04:31:09.389 --> 04:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
the um need for closure and compensation
 
04:31:12.389 --> 04:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
for these victims that were the subject
 
04:31:14.109 --> 04:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
of some pretty
 
04:31:18.070 --> 04:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
significant um and horrific abuse under
 
04:31:24.790 --> 04:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:30.349 --> 04:31:30.359 align:start position:0%
care they're on page six on line
 
04:31:34.710 --> 04:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
11 the date for filing for settlements
 
04:31:38.030 --> 04:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
is extended to June 30th of 2025 it's
 
04:31:40.710 --> 04:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
currently the end of this year that will
 
04:31:43.309 --> 04:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
allow a little bit more time given that
 
04:31:46.030 --> 04:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
we are making
 
04:31:46.040 --> 04:31:47.550 align:start position:0%
we are making
changes

04:31:47.550 --> 04:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
changes
 
04:31:47.560 --> 04:31:50.189 align:start position:0%
changes
um

04:31:50.189 --> 04:31:50.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:53.510 --> 04:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
then there are numerous places where
 
04:31:56.910 --> 04:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
other abuse um as opposed to physical
 
04:31:58.630 --> 04:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
abuse comes in for instance at the
 
04:32:03.870 --> 04:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:06.790 --> 04:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
33 also at the top of page seven but you
 
04:32:10.670 --> 04:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
see that numerous times so I'm going to
 
04:32:10.680 --> 04:32:12.309 align:start position:0%
see that numerous times so I'm going to
um

04:32:12.309 --> 04:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:14.189 --> 04:32:14.199 align:start position:0%
flip to page
 
04:32:18.269 --> 04:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
nine uh actually
 
04:32:22.030 --> 04:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
10 um new language has been
 
04:32:27.469 --> 04:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
added on page 10 excuse me line 18 and
 
04:32:31.469 --> 04:32:31.479 align:start position:0%
line 17 about investigations being
 
04:32:33.830 --> 04:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
conducted in a trauma informed
 
04:32:37.469 --> 04:32:37.479 align:start position:0%
respectful and dignified manner um this
 
04:32:39.750 --> 04:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
is obviously part of the settlement to
 
04:32:42.229 --> 04:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
make sure that victims are treated
 
04:32:44.109 --> 04:32:44.119 align:start position:0%
appropriately because that's what they
 
04:32:48.469 --> 04:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:53.990 --> 04:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
victims again um hitting the highlights
 
04:32:57.790 --> 04:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
on page 11 the Attorney General design
 
04:33:00.189 --> 04:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
and the claiming or claimants may also
 
04:33:03.189 --> 04:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
engage in discussions to resolve claims
 
04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:16.750 --> 04:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
sense so at the bottom of um page 12 is
 
04:33:20.830 --> 04:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
a um provision that allows a claim to be
 
04:33:24.310 --> 04:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:26.789 --> 04:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
installments which is very important in
 
04:33:30.429 --> 04:33:30.439 align:start position:0%
the managing of our budget situation um
 
04:33:34.070 --> 04:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
we are projecting in this bill and that
 
04:33:38.029 --> 04:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
would mean please turn to page um
 
04:33:38.039 --> 04:33:40.230 align:start position:0%
would mean please turn to page um
13

04:33:40.230 --> 04:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
13
 
04:33:43.470 --> 04:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
that approx imately $75
 
04:33:46.670 --> 04:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
million um would need to be appropriated
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
in any given fiscal year so the Attorney
 
04:33:52.910 --> 04:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
General can probably give more upto-date
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
numbers but my understanding is there
 
04:33:58.429 --> 04:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
are well over a 100 cases that have
 
04:34:00.789 --> 04:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
settled at about
 
04:34:02.709 --> 04:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
$450 to
 
04:34:06.390 --> 04:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
$500,000 on average per claim so I think
 
04:34:10.670 --> 04:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
you can see the need for managing the
 
04:34:12.830 --> 04:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
budget process for to the state while at
 
04:34:15.910 --> 04:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
the same time protecting the
 
04:34:18.189 --> 04:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
rights of the victims and the
 
04:34:23.869 --> 04:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:28.070 --> 04:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
compensation on line 20 the
 
04:34:30.269 --> 04:34:30.279 align:start position:0%
administrator will have
 
04:34:33.470 --> 04:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
discretion within available
 
04:34:35.709 --> 04:34:35.719 align:start position:0%
Appropriations to determine whether a
 
04:34:38.029 --> 04:34:38.039 align:start position:0%
claim should be paid as a lump
 
04:34:41.990 --> 04:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
sum or in increments over a several year
 
04:34:44.750 --> 04:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
period again this is a budget
 
04:34:47.390 --> 04:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
management um
 
04:34:52.789 --> 04:34:52.799 align:start position:0%
tool there on line 26 in order to make
 
04:34:55.150 --> 04:34:55.160 align:start position:0%
that fair for the
 
04:35:00.310 --> 04:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
victim a 5% interest um will go along
 
04:35:02.750 --> 04:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
with the the extended payments as
 
04:35:07.949 --> 04:35:07.959 align:start position:0%
opposed to a lump sum payment that was
 
04:35:12.590 --> 04:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
um a agreed upon percentage between the
 
04:35:15.390 --> 04:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and the
 
04:35:17.390 --> 04:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
attorneys from Nix and PE buy I think
 
04:35:20.310 --> 04:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
that's fair given that there could be
 
04:35:22.990 --> 04:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
extended um
 
04:35:23.000 --> 04:35:24.670 align:start position:0%
extended um
settlements

04:35:24.670 --> 04:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
settlements
 
04:35:29.709 --> 04:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
um so I think I skipped over a little
 
04:35:33.310 --> 04:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
bit uh the $75 million that's what's
 
04:35:36.390 --> 04:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
anticipated that the administrator could
 
04:35:39.070 --> 04:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
not authorize more than 75 million in
 
04:35:44.551 --> 04:35:44.561 align:start position:0%
any fiscal year but the administ rator
 
04:35:48.109 --> 04:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
um is allowed to ask the fiscal
 
04:35:51.310 --> 04:35:51.320 align:start position:0%
committee to um exceed that amount
 
04:35:56.029 --> 04:35:56.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:56.039 --> 04:35:59.670 align:start position:0%
 
necessary

04:35:59.670 --> 04:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:02.240 --> 04:36:02.250 align:start position:0%
um on page
 
04:36:02.250 --> 04:36:03.551 align:start position:0%
um on page
[Music]

04:36:03.551 --> 04:36:03.561 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:36:06.869 --> 04:36:06.879 align:start position:0%
14 um this again talks about what
 
04:36:09.869 --> 04:36:09.879 align:start position:0%
happens if the administrator feels
 
04:36:12.029 --> 04:36:12.039 align:start position:0%
believes there's a shortfall in the
 
04:36:15.830 --> 04:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
settlement fund um to after consultation
 
04:36:19.629 --> 04:36:19.639 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general um can make a
 
04:36:22.150 --> 04:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
request of an additional
 
04:36:26.910 --> 04:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation on lines 22 and 20 through
 
04:36:31.230 --> 04:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
24 um the state treasurer is authorized
 
04:36:32.789 --> 04:36:32.799 align:start position:0%
with the approval of the fiscal
 
04:36:35.670 --> 04:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
committee to borrow if that becomes
 
04:36:38.029 --> 04:36:38.039 align:start position:0%
necessary hopefully it never becomes
 
04:36:40.670 --> 04:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
necessary because we're trying to design
 
04:36:42.269 --> 04:36:42.279 align:start position:0%
a process
 
04:36:45.150 --> 04:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
manages the
 
04:36:49.310 --> 04:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and then the last
 
04:36:53.709 --> 04:36:53.719 align:start position:0%
uh um critical piece and I apologize I
 
04:36:56.551 --> 04:36:56.561 align:start position:0%
was using the bill as introduced um I'll
 
04:36:58.830 --> 04:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
go to the senate pass version the only
 
04:37:02.150 --> 04:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
amendment that the Senate made to the
 
04:37:08.869 --> 04:37:08.879 align:start position:0%
bill um was on page 19 adding the $60
 
04:37:08.879 --> 04:37:10.269 align:start position:0%
bill um was on page 19 adding the $60
million

04:37:10.269 --> 04:37:10.279 align:start position:0%
million
 
04:37:13.789 --> 04:37:13.799 align:start position:0%
appropriation um on line 19 that was at
 
04:37:15.510 --> 04:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
the recommendation of the Attorney
 
04:37:18.590 --> 04:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
General's office this is a uh large
 
04:37:21.230 --> 04:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
amount of money on top of the100 million
 
04:37:23.029 --> 04:37:23.039 align:start position:0%
that's already been
 
04:37:25.629 --> 04:37:25.639 align:start position:0%
segregated from the rainy day fund for
 
04:37:29.029 --> 04:37:29.039 align:start position:0%
purposes of trying to resolve this so um
 
04:37:31.349 --> 04:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
I apologize for taking a long amount of
 
04:37:33.310 --> 04:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
time I just want to walk through the
 
04:37:36.150 --> 04:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
highlights and again stress the
 
04:37:39.709 --> 04:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
importance of a um unless there's
 
04:37:41.990 --> 04:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
agreement between the attorney General's
 
04:37:45.750 --> 04:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
office and the attorneys that this is a
 
04:37:48.869 --> 04:37:48.879 align:start position:0%
package and it holds together because
 
04:37:51.510 --> 04:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
there was cooperation um and quite
 
04:37:53.349 --> 04:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
frankly both sides should be
 
04:37:55.470 --> 04:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
congratulated for the cooperation that
 
04:37:58.709 --> 04:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
they've um exhibited so please no
 
04:38:00.869 --> 04:38:00.879 align:start position:0%
amendments unless both sides have agreed
 
04:38:03.189 --> 04:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
to an amendment that doesn't mean there
 
04:38:06.510 --> 04:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
may not be good ideas but please um this
 
04:38:09.670 --> 04:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
is a settlement piece of legislation and
 
04:38:13.029 --> 04:38:13.039 align:start position:0%
again um this allows
 
04:38:16.949 --> 04:38:16.959 align:start position:0%
us to do right by victims but at the
 
04:38:19.230 --> 04:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
same time protect the longer term
 
04:38:22.230 --> 04:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
Financial Health of the state that's a
 
04:38:26.551 --> 04:38:26.561 align:start position:0%
very difficult task for all of us and I
 
04:38:29.390 --> 04:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
think that's why the Senate voted for
 
04:38:31.629 --> 04:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
this 24 to nothing because I think
 
04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
people on both sides of the aisle have
 
04:38:37.150 --> 04:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
seen this as a way to resolve these
 
04:38:40.269 --> 04:38:40.279 align:start position:0%
egregious problems of the past doing
 
04:38:42.629 --> 04:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
right by victims but but protecting the
 
04:38:44.990 --> 04:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
state so happy to answer any questions
 
04:38:49.070 --> 04:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:51.429 --> 04:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
chair representative
 
04:38:54.029 --> 04:38:54.039 align:start position:0%
Muse I I did have one question and for
 
04:38:56.830 --> 04:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
forgive my ignorance on this but are
 
04:38:59.310 --> 04:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
settlements are not not settlements but
 
04:39:01.269 --> 04:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
are judgments that are independent of
 
04:39:03.070 --> 04:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
the settlement process paid out of the
 
04:39:05.429 --> 04:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
settlement fund or do they come from
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
another fin that's probably the Attorney
 
04:39:09.070 --> 04:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
General could better answer than me but
 
04:39:11.029 --> 04:39:11.039 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the attorney general
 
04:39:13.830 --> 04:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
or already has the authority to make
 
04:39:17.429 --> 04:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
settlement cases up to I believe it's
 
04:39:20.070 --> 04:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
$475,000 if an attorney general deems
 
04:39:22.830 --> 04:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
that is in the best interest of the
 
04:39:25.390 --> 04:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
state and it would be outside of this
 
04:39:29.310 --> 04:39:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:32.070 --> 04:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
you representative Harry
 
04:39:35.629 --> 04:39:35.639 align:start position:0%
gather thank you madam chair um on page
 
04:39:38.390 --> 04:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
19 you mentioned can you tell me again
 
04:39:41.948 --> 04:39:41.958 align:start position:0%
what was on page 19 because what I have
 
04:39:45.030 --> 04:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
only goes up to I believe 16 so I just
 
04:39:48.270 --> 04:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to capture what you said I think
 
04:39:50.708 --> 04:39:50.718 align:start position:0%
that was in the original
 
04:39:54.750 --> 04:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
maybe I think I said 19 and I apologize
 
04:39:57.910 --> 04:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
I should have said 15 so the amendment
 
04:40:01.948 --> 04:40:01.958 align:start position:0%
that the Senate adopted was on page 15
 
04:40:05.750 --> 04:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
l19 um the $60 million appropriation on
 
04:40:08.948 --> 04:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
top of the $100 million that the
 
04:40:11.350 --> 04:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
previous legislature put into a
 
04:40:13.788 --> 04:40:13.798 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund for this
 
04:40:16.670 --> 04:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
purpose thank you
 
04:40:18.910 --> 04:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
mhm seeing no further questions thank
 
04:40:21.948 --> 04:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:45.470 --> 04:40:45.480 align:start position:0%

04:41:15.750 --> 04:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
facilities my colleagues wish that they
 
04:41:17.750 --> 04:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
could be here today although they are
 
04:41:19.628 --> 04:41:19.638 align:start position:0%
unable to attend because they're

meaningful changes to the settlement
 
04:41:39.470 --> 04:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
fund that we believe will make the fund
 
04:41:43.270 --> 04:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
more attractive to to our clients the
 
04:41:46.110 --> 04:41:46.120 align:start position:0%

04:42:05.190 --> 04:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
settlement process and represent those
 
04:42:07.830 --> 04:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
clients through all stages of the
 
04:42:09.470 --> 04:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
settlement fund
 
04:42:12.110 --> 04:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
process however to date a small
 
04:42:14.830 --> 04:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of our clients have actually
 
04:42:18.310 --> 04:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
submitted claims to the fund and that's
 
04:42:20.788 --> 04:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons including the
 
04:42:24.230 --> 04:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
fact that the Caps are too low on
 
04:42:26.470 --> 04:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
compensation in the current uh form of
 
04:42:30.150 --> 04:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
the program and also because the program
 
04:42:34.270 --> 04:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
only compensates victims for a limited
 
04:42:36.750 --> 04:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
scope of abuse and by that I mean
 
04:42:40.350 --> 04:42:40.360 align:start position:0%
strictly sexual abuse and physical abuse
 
04:42:41.948 --> 04:42:41.958 align:start position:0%
um it's also problematic that the
 
04:42:45.350 --> 04:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
current fund is cumbersome uh time
 
04:42:48.628 --> 04:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
consuming um and at times not victim
 
04:42:51.788 --> 04:42:51.798 align:start position:0%
friendly however the bill before this
 
04:42:55.350 --> 04:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
committee addresses those issues and I'd
 
04:42:56.788 --> 04:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
like to take a moment to thank the
 
04:42:59.350 --> 04:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office for their
 
04:43:01.910 --> 04:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
cooperation um in coming to these
 
04:43:04.590 --> 04:43:04.600 align:start position:0%
compromises that are reflected in the
 
04:43:08.430 --> 04:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
bill before the committee um namely
 
04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
those include um increased caps like you
 
04:43:14.190 --> 04:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
heard uh Senator Bradley refer to um
 
04:43:19.510 --> 04:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
caps on sexual abuse um and caps on um
 
04:43:22.270 --> 04:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
other abuse um other abuse is a
 
04:43:26.270 --> 04:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
significant compromise in this bill um
 
04:43:28.190 --> 04:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
whereas the current fund only
 
04:43:30.430 --> 04:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
compensates for sexual abuse and
 
04:43:34.390 --> 04:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
physical abuse the improvements that are
 
04:43:38.030 --> 04:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
recommended in the bill would make it so
 
04:43:40.030 --> 04:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
that there's a category of sexual abuse
 
04:43:42.390 --> 04:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
and other abuse and other abuse would
 
04:43:45.430 --> 04:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
Encompass not only physical abuse but
 
04:43:48.150 --> 04:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
other types of abuse such as solitary
 
04:43:56.788 --> 04:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:00.430 --> 04:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
endangerment and so we support this bill
 
04:44:07.110 --> 04:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
for our clients because um it makes it
 
04:44:11.350 --> 04:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
so that our clients feel validated feel
 
04:44:14.550 --> 04:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
that their abuse um is validated I've
 
04:44:17.830 --> 04:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
heard from clients who are so encouraged
 
04:44:19.830 --> 04:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
at the prospect that they could receive
 
04:44:23.708 --> 04:44:23.718 align:start position:0%
compensation for the very lengthy
 
04:44:26.350 --> 04:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement that they endured
 
04:44:28.948 --> 04:44:28.958 align:start position:0%
at YDC and the other state facilities
 
04:44:32.190 --> 04:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with victims of egregious
 
04:44:35.948 --> 04:44:35.958 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse that feel validated that
 
04:44:39.550 --> 04:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
there could now be a cap of $2.5 million
 
04:44:41.910 --> 04:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh for what they went through
 
04:44:44.708 --> 04:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
and while not all of our clients are
 
04:44:46.510 --> 04:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
excited to talk about what happened to
 
04:44:49.030 --> 04:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
them most of them are certainly eager to
 
04:44:51.310 --> 04:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
settle their claims as quickly as
 
04:44:54.350 --> 04:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
possible and this bill provides the
 
04:44:57.190 --> 04:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
framework for a much more expeditious
 
04:45:00.830 --> 04:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
process uh including because it permits
 
04:45:03.070 --> 04:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
the administrator to appoint assistant
 
04:45:06.070 --> 04:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
administrators which would speed up the
 
04:45:08.350 --> 04:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
processing of individual
 
04:45:11.910 --> 04:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
claims overall we support the changes in
 
04:45:15.230 --> 04:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
the bill we encourage the committee to
 
04:45:17.990 --> 04:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
pass it and as our letter to Senator
 
04:45:21.030 --> 04:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
Bradley indicated um if this bill is
 
04:45:24.470 --> 04:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
enacted we anticipate recommending the
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
fund to the vast majority of our clients
 
04:45:30.430 --> 04:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
as appropriate based on the facts and
 
04:45:32.788 --> 04:45:32.798 align:start position:0%
circumstances of each case thank you and
 
04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions thank
 
04:45:37.230 --> 04:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony I
 
04:45:39.430 --> 04:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
don't see no questions thank you very
 
04:45:42.430 --> 04:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
04:45:43.440 --> 04:45:43.450 align:start position:0%
Mr attorney
 
04:45:43.450 --> 04:45:55.670 align:start position:0%
Mr attorney
[Music]

04:45:55.670 --> 04:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:58.110 --> 04:45:58.120 align:start position:0%
general thank you madam chair uh members
 
04:45:59.830 --> 04:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee good afternoon uh just
 
04:46:03.270 --> 04:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
for the record John formela attorney
 
04:46:07.110 --> 04:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
general um whenever I speak about this
 
04:46:08.270 --> 04:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
topic whether it's in front of the
 
04:46:09.830 --> 04:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
legislature or anywhere else I always
 
04:46:11.390 --> 04:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
just like to start by acknowleding ing
 
04:46:13.230 --> 04:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
the difficulty of the topic and the
 
04:46:14.750 --> 04:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
difficulty of the material and
 
04:46:17.590 --> 04:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
acknowledge what the victims that we're
 
04:46:19.628 --> 04:46:19.638 align:start position:0%
speaking about have been through I think
 
04:46:22.750 --> 04:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
it's always important to to keep in mind
 
04:46:25.110 --> 04:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
that you know we we have a lot of people
 
04:46:27.830 --> 04:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
involved here and each one has a a
 
04:46:29.590 --> 04:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
different story and it's important to
 
04:46:31.310 --> 04:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
remember that they're each individuals
 
04:46:34.150 --> 04:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
and so while you know with a with a case
 
04:46:36.230 --> 04:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
like this that involves so many victims
 
04:46:38.430 --> 04:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
we just try not to lose lose sight of
 
04:46:41.150 --> 04:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
that um just take a moment want to
 
04:46:43.548 --> 04:46:43.558 align:start position:0%
remind the committee as well that you
 
04:46:45.270 --> 04:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
know as attorney
 
04:46:47.788 --> 04:46:47.798 align:start position:0%
general for something like this I play a
 
04:46:49.670 --> 04:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
really unique role because I have to
 
04:46:51.948 --> 04:46:51.958 align:start position:0%
oversee both the office's civil
 
04:46:54.310 --> 04:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
litigation function and the criminal
 
04:46:56.310 --> 04:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
investigation the criminal prosecutions
 
04:46:59.270 --> 04:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
so that that is a you know it's
 
04:47:00.868 --> 04:47:00.878 align:start position:0%
something that has been discussed in the
 
04:47:04.548 --> 04:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
Press it's a concept that I admit can be
 
04:47:07.270 --> 04:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to Grapple with um it is just
 
04:47:09.510 --> 04:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
part of the very unique role that we
 
04:47:10.948 --> 04:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
play at the Attorney General's office
 
04:47:12.270 --> 04:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
office and we we take our
 
04:47:14.190 --> 04:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities very seriously to try
 
04:47:16.910 --> 04:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
to separate those functions and to
 
04:47:19.510 --> 04:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
perform both of those functions in good
 
04:47:21.510 --> 04:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
faith and on behalf of the people of the
 
04:47:24.910 --> 04:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
state but it does it will perhaps limit
 
04:47:26.868 --> 04:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
some of the questions I can answer I'll
 
04:47:29.030 --> 04:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
take all every question you have at at
 
04:47:31.350 --> 04:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
the end of my remarks but it may limit
 
04:47:33.190 --> 04:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
me and what what I can answer and what I
 
04:47:35.270 --> 04:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
can say but I just like to to put that
 
04:47:36.948 --> 04:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
out there and remind members of the
 
04:47:38.670 --> 04:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
committee of
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
that as many of you will recall we uh
 
04:47:45.548 --> 04:47:45.558 align:start position:0%
came to the legislature in 2022 to
 
04:47:48.430 --> 04:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
establish the YDC uh claims fund and
 
04:47:53.110 --> 04:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
settlement process at the time over 400
 
04:47:56.430 --> 04:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
victims had come forward so even in 2022
 
04:47:58.350 --> 04:47:58.360 align:start position:0%
we already knew that this was a major
 
04:48:00.910 --> 04:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
undertaking and we were dealing with a
 
04:48:07.548 --> 04:48:07.558 align:start position:0%
situation in which many people as who uh
 
04:48:08.990 --> 04:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with the situation
 
04:48:11.470 --> 04:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
involving many people who are suffered
 
04:48:14.788 --> 04:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
some Terrible Things terrible abuse
 
04:48:17.150 --> 04:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
physical and sexual abuse as children
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
while in state
 
04:48:22.190 --> 04:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
custody when we brought this to the
 
04:48:25.750 --> 04:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
legislature in 2022 we also made clear
 
04:48:28.430 --> 04:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
that we still didn't know the full scope
 
04:48:29.868 --> 04:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
of what we were dealing with and we
 
04:48:31.510 --> 04:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
didn't think we were going to know the
 
04:48:33.150 --> 04:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
full scope of what we were dealing with
 
04:48:34.430 --> 04:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
for some
 
04:48:38.110 --> 04:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
time we also talked about the fact
 
04:48:41.788 --> 04:48:41.798 align:start position:0%
that these are difficult cases and
 
04:48:44.310 --> 04:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
difficult stories to hear and grapple
 
04:48:46.910 --> 04:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
with for a number of reasons one of
 
04:48:51.470 --> 04:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
course is the just the uh the terrible
 
04:48:53.230 --> 04:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
stories you hear about abuse that that
 
04:48:56.590 --> 04:48:56.600 align:start position:0%
kids suffered in state custody um what
 
04:48:58.350 --> 04:48:58.360 align:start position:0%
also makes it difficult is that this
 
04:49:01.510 --> 04:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
happened many many years ago and so
 
04:49:03.590 --> 04:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
cases involving sexual assault
 
04:49:05.788 --> 04:49:05.798 align:start position:0%
especially and cases involving sexual
 
04:49:09.830 --> 04:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
assault of kids are incredibly difficult
 
04:49:11.830 --> 04:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
um to
 
04:49:15.350 --> 04:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
to investigate and prosecute or to
 
04:49:17.628 --> 04:49:17.638 align:start position:0%
evaluate for purposes of civil
 
04:49:19.628 --> 04:49:19.638 align:start position:0%
litigation if they happened very
 
04:49:22.708 --> 04:49:22.718 align:start position:0%
recently they're all the more difficult
 
04:49:25.110 --> 04:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
to address and deal with if they've
 
04:49:27.788 --> 04:49:27.798 align:start position:0%
happened many years ago so we talked
 
04:49:29.230 --> 04:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
about that when we had brought this
 
04:49:31.150 --> 04:49:31.160 align:start position:0%
forward back in
 
04:49:34.230 --> 04:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
2022 um and then of course we talked
 
04:49:39.390 --> 04:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
about the um difficulty of assessing
 
04:49:43.150 --> 04:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
really what the legal exposure is to the
 
04:49:44.430 --> 04:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
state when you're dealing with
 
04:49:47.190 --> 04:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
potentially at the time hundreds and now
 
04:49:50.190 --> 04:49:50.200 align:start position:0%
over a thousand cases so I say all of
 
04:49:54.150 --> 04:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
that just to um emphasize that this
 
04:49:57.270 --> 04:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
is I look at this as an incredibly
 
04:49:59.510 --> 04:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
important piece of legislation and I
 
04:50:01.190 --> 04:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
look at this process as incredibly
 
04:50:03.670 --> 04:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
important for the state not just to
 
04:50:06.990 --> 04:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
limit the state's exposure in litigation
 
04:50:11.910 --> 04:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
but to um make right what was a terrible
 
04:50:14.270 --> 04:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
wrong that was done to to many kids in
 
04:50:16.390 --> 04:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
state custody of
 
04:50:19.390 --> 04:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
course all situations are unique and all
 
04:50:21.350 --> 04:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
victims had their own experience and
 
04:50:24.190 --> 04:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
every particular case needs to be vetted
 
04:50:27.230 --> 04:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
based on the facts of that case but when
 
04:50:30.510 --> 04:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
you think of this in totality um again
 
04:50:32.750 --> 04:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's difficult for a lot of reasons
 
04:50:34.750 --> 04:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
we also recognized at doj that the
 
04:50:36.868 --> 04:50:36.878 align:start position:0%
traditional litigation process can be
 
04:50:39.350 --> 04:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
difficult right and that's what led to
 
04:50:42.548 --> 04:50:42.558 align:start position:0%
establishing this process and based on
 
04:50:45.070 --> 04:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
all of those things we recommended in
 
04:50:47.750 --> 04:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
2022 that we establish this claims fund
 
04:50:50.030 --> 04:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
and settlement process as an alternative
 
04:50:53.270 --> 04:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
to traditional litigation um as an
 
04:50:56.628 --> 04:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
alternative to a process that can be
 
04:50:59.070 --> 04:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
very difficult for anyone who may have
 
04:51:00.788 --> 04:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
to interact with the court system but
 
04:51:03.510 --> 04:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
can be especially difficult for someone
 
04:51:06.350 --> 04:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
who was the victim of physical or sexual
 
04:51:08.910 --> 04:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
abuse as a
 
04:51:13.270 --> 04:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
child so the legisl ped hb1 1677 in 2022
 
04:51:15.430 --> 04:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
and it set up the process we have
 
04:51:19.430 --> 04:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
today um I I am
 
04:51:21.750 --> 04:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
very you know there it can be difficult
 
04:51:23.590 --> 04:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
to find the right words but I'm proud of
 
04:51:26.110 --> 04:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
the work that we have done as a state in
 
04:51:28.708 --> 04:51:28.718 align:start position:0%
current times to to address this
 
04:51:28.718 --> 04:51:30.230 align:start position:0%
current times to to address this
situation

04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:51:34.190 --> 04:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
um I I think that the state
 
04:51:36.708 --> 04:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
should you know should should take pride
 
04:51:38.628 --> 04:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
in the fact that we have confronted a
 
04:51:40.990 --> 04:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
wrong that took place many years ago and
 
04:51:43.030 --> 04:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
that we are doing our best as Senator
 
04:51:45.708 --> 04:51:45.718 align:start position:0%
Bradley said to try to respect the need
 
04:51:48.910 --> 04:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
to compensate victims respect the um the
 
04:51:51.350 --> 04:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
rights and dignity of victims while
 
04:51:53.430 --> 04:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
protecting the state's bottom line and
 
04:51:56.150 --> 04:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
the state's ability to to budget to date
 
04:52:00.830 --> 04:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
we've resolved 147 claims for a total of
 
04:52:03.990 --> 04:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
about $715 million and the average claim
 
04:52:06.430 --> 04:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
paid so far is about
 
04:52:08.910 --> 04:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
$486,000 that average has been pretty
 
04:52:10.830 --> 04:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
consistent throughout the process so
 
04:52:12.670 --> 04:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
that just gives you a sense of of the
 
04:52:15.990 --> 04:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
numbers um and I think while we can
 
04:52:18.628 --> 04:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
expect those numbers to continue to move
 
04:52:21.910 --> 04:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
that generally Falls in fact below the
 
04:52:25.230 --> 04:52:25.240 align:start position:0%
projections we made in 2022 so 147
 
04:52:28.470 --> 04:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
claims resolved to date 71.5 million an
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:34.548 --> 04:52:34.558 align:start position:0%
$486,000 uh as Council for Nixon puddy
 
04:52:36.270 --> 04:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
or accounts for the from Nixon pey for
 
04:52:38.548 --> 04:52:38.558 align:start position:0%
the plaintiffs mentioned when we were
 
04:52:41.670 --> 04:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
having these negotiations back in 202 22
 
04:52:44.150 --> 04:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
there since the process has begun there
 
04:52:45.670 --> 04:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
have been
 
04:52:48.628 --> 04:52:48.638 align:start position:0%
three primary topics that have prevented
 
04:52:51.190 --> 04:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
many claimants from coming into the
 
04:52:55.190 --> 04:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
fund the first is that the Caps were too
 
04:52:57.948 --> 04:52:57.958 align:start position:0%
low the second is that the scope was too
 
04:53:00.110 --> 04:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
limited and that the third is that the
 
04:53:02.270 --> 04:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
process was overly complex and
 
04:53:04.910 --> 04:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
burdensome so last fall we began
 
04:53:06.990 --> 04:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
negotiations we reopened negotiations
 
04:53:09.230 --> 04:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
with Nixon puddy and and Russ Riley
 
04:53:13.270 --> 04:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
because we wanted to take another shot
 
04:53:15.230 --> 04:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
at getting to agreement on something
 
04:53:18.670 --> 04:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
that could provide a fair and reasonable
 
04:53:20.548 --> 04:53:20.558 align:start position:0%
and more victim centered and Trauma
 
04:53:22.510 --> 04:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
informed approach for the vast majority
 
04:53:24.868 --> 04:53:24.878 align:start position:0%
of the victims involved in this case and
 
04:53:27.788 --> 04:53:27.798 align:start position:0%
we spent months with those negotiations
 
04:53:30.030 --> 04:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
and what you see before you today is a
 
04:53:34.150 --> 04:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
product of um difficult but respectful
 
04:53:36.750 --> 04:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
negotiations um sometimes contentious
 
04:53:38.510 --> 04:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
but I think always conducted in good
 
04:53:41.788 --> 04:53:41.798 align:start position:0%
faith so I want to certainly thank Nixon
 
04:53:44.110 --> 04:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
peab buddy and Russ Riley specifically
 
04:53:47.230 --> 04:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
Dave venanzo Mark Knights Dan Dean
 
04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
certainly want to thank attorney caner
 
04:53:50.948 --> 04:53:50.958 align:start position:0%
for her involvement in the process and I
 
04:53:52.548 --> 04:53:52.558 align:start position:0%
want to thank those from my team who
 
04:53:54.590 --> 04:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
have been involved Matt Broadhead is
 
04:53:57.070 --> 04:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
here today Sam Garland is here today Jen
 
04:53:59.390 --> 04:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
Ramsey here today they're all with my
 
04:54:01.750 --> 04:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
office this and I certainly want to
 
04:54:02.868 --> 04:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
thank Senator Bradley and all the
 
04:54:05.830 --> 04:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
legislators involved at crafting what
 
04:54:08.230 --> 04:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
sits before you as as a compromise it is
 
04:54:10.910 --> 04:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
it is a true compromise in that there
 
04:54:14.430 --> 04:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
are pieces in this bill that if I could
 
04:54:16.310 --> 04:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
write the bill the way I wanted to write
 
04:54:18.110 --> 04:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
it or write a settlement process the way
 
04:54:19.948 --> 04:54:19.958 align:start position:0%
I wanted to write it I wouldn't have in
 
04:54:21.868 --> 04:54:21.878 align:start position:0%
there and there are certainly pieces in
 
04:54:23.430 --> 04:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
the bill that if plaintiff's council
 
04:54:26.070 --> 04:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to to put or that plaintiff's
 
04:54:27.670 --> 04:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
council probably didn't want in there
 
04:54:29.150 --> 04:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
and there are pieces that they wanted in
 
04:54:30.670 --> 04:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
there that didn't make it in it is a
 
04:54:32.990 --> 04:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
true compromise that that sits before
 
04:54:37.150 --> 04:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
you and it is a collective uh best
 
04:54:39.150 --> 04:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
effort to address a very difficult
 
04:54:41.670 --> 04:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
situation we do not claim it is perfect
 
04:54:44.510 --> 04:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
by any means but what I can represent to
 
04:54:46.830 --> 04:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
you in my role as attorney general is I
 
04:54:49.230 --> 04:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
think this is a very good faith effort
 
04:54:53.830 --> 04:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
to address a very difficult and complex
 
04:54:57.150 --> 04:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
uh problem and to make right a wrong
 
04:54:59.670 --> 04:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
that was done to many victims so I don't
 
04:55:01.788 --> 04:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
want to repeat too much what you've
 
04:55:03.670 --> 04:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
already heard because Senator Bradley
 
04:55:04.990 --> 04:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
gave you a lot of details of what the
 
04:55:06.750 --> 04:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
bill does I just want to hit a couple
 
04:55:09.190 --> 04:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
high points and then I'll be happy to
 
04:55:11.110 --> 04:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
04:55:13.310 --> 04:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
but as I mentioned one of the big issues
 
04:55:15.110 --> 04:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
with the previous or with the current
 
04:55:17.510 --> 04:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
process is that the Caps were too low
 
04:55:18.470 --> 04:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
that was one of the issues that
 
04:55:21.788 --> 04:55:21.798 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs had raised so this bill
 
04:55:24.310 --> 04:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
raises the cap for abuse that would fall
 
04:55:26.030 --> 04:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
into the category of egregious sexual
 
04:55:29.350 --> 04:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
abuse from 1.5 million to $2.5
 
04:55:31.230 --> 04:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
million there's a definition of
 
04:55:33.670 --> 04:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
egregious sexual abuse in the bill it is
 
04:55:37.708 --> 04:55:37.718 align:start position:0%
generally defined as sexual abuse that
 
04:55:41.190 --> 04:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
is um just of a nature that's much worse
 
04:55:43.270 --> 04:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
than most other instances of sexual
 
04:55:45.430 --> 04:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
abuse that you've seen from victims that
 
04:55:48.350 --> 04:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
have come forward who who are at YDC
 
04:55:50.590 --> 04:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
ultimately the the determination will
 
04:55:52.350 --> 04:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
need to be made by the administrator
 
04:55:54.150 --> 04:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
administrator John bradrick so there's
 
04:55:56.150 --> 04:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
discretion left to the administrator but
 
04:55:57.590 --> 04:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's the general definition of
 
04:55:59.510 --> 04:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
egregious sexual
 
04:56:01.750 --> 04:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
abuse there's a number of other factors
 
04:56:04.868 --> 04:56:04.878 align:start position:0%
listed in the bill that you you uh the
 
04:56:06.548 --> 04:56:06.558 align:start position:0%
administrator can look at to determine
 
04:56:08.070 --> 04:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
whether something's egregious I won't
 
04:56:09.390 --> 04:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
read through them but I'm happy to
 
04:56:11.788 --> 04:56:11.798 align:start position:0%
answer question questions on
 
04:56:14.590 --> 04:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
them the definition of sexual abuse was
 
04:56:17.110 --> 04:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
also expanded to include things like
 
04:56:20.310 --> 04:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
indecent exposure um invasion of privacy
 
04:56:23.470 --> 04:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
a common law invasion of privacy I just
 
04:56:26.708 --> 04:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
point out that not all sexual abuse is
 
04:56:29.548 --> 04:56:29.558 align:start position:0%
valued the same so while the category of
 
04:56:32.230 --> 04:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse is expanded in the current
 
04:56:34.270 --> 04:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines you know the worst forms of
 
04:56:36.310 --> 04:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse are valued at
 
04:56:39.788 --> 04:56:39.798 align:start position:0%
$200,000 and um as you go down the list
 
04:56:41.948 --> 04:56:41.958 align:start position:0%
the lowest value is
 
04:56:44.548 --> 04:56:44.558 align:start position:0%
$25,000 saying all that of course it's
 
04:56:46.510 --> 04:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
important to acknowledge that there's
 
04:56:48.948 --> 04:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
really no dollar amount you can put on
 
04:56:52.350 --> 04:56:52.360 align:start position:0%
this type of abuse right and there it I
 
04:56:55.270 --> 04:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
think we all have sort of this gut
 
04:56:57.310 --> 04:56:57.320 align:start position:0%
negative reaction to even putting a
 
04:57:00.548 --> 04:57:00.558 align:start position:0%
number on on something like this but
 
04:57:03.590 --> 04:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
that that is the way the law compensates
 
04:57:05.990 --> 04:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
for injury it compensates with with
 
04:57:08.110 --> 04:57:08.120 align:start position:0%
dollars and so we're doing our best to
 
04:57:10.788 --> 04:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
put a dollar number on it um but in
 
04:57:12.628 --> 04:57:12.638 align:start position:0%
reality no amount of money could ever
 
04:57:15.470 --> 04:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
truly compensate for abuse like
 
04:57:19.510 --> 04:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
this as attorney caner as attorney caner
 
04:57:23.910 --> 04:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned we also expand sort physical
 
04:57:25.750 --> 04:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
abuse so we remove the category of
 
04:57:27.948 --> 04:57:27.958 align:start position:0%
physical abuse and it now includes other
 
04:57:30.990 --> 04:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
abuse so other abuse includes the
 
04:57:33.350 --> 04:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
physical abuse that's in the current
 
04:57:36.270 --> 04:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
process so it includes what already was
 
04:57:38.670 --> 04:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
listed as physical abuse but we add a
 
04:57:41.430 --> 04:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
few things like Reckless conduct
 
04:57:44.270 --> 04:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening child endangerment
 
04:57:46.350 --> 04:57:46.360 align:start position:0%
unlawful strip searches intentional
 
04:57:49.190 --> 04:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
Affliction of emotional distress and
 
04:57:52.628 --> 04:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
unlawful restraint again this is a this
 
04:57:54.390 --> 04:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
is a compromise I know when we talked
 
04:57:57.070 --> 04:57:57.080 align:start position:0%
about the bill in 2022 some of these
 
04:57:59.270 --> 04:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
categories of abuse we decided not to
 
04:58:02.470 --> 04:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
include but we have I would say a couple
 
04:58:04.390 --> 04:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
things to that one we have a lot more
 
04:58:06.948 --> 04:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
information now two years later about
 
04:58:09.510 --> 04:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
what happened at YDC based on the claims
 
04:58:11.030 --> 04:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
that have come through through we've
 
04:58:15.270 --> 04:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of stories um and we have
 
04:58:17.628 --> 04:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
you know it it can be difficult to talk
 
04:58:20.990 --> 04:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
about these things in the abstract it it
 
04:58:22.910 --> 04:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
you really get a better understanding of
 
04:58:25.470 --> 04:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
what happened when you hear stories from
 
04:58:27.190 --> 04:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
specific victims and it was based on
 
04:58:29.430 --> 04:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
those stories and based on discussions
 
04:58:32.310 --> 04:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
with plaintiff's council um that we made
 
04:58:35.030 --> 04:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
the decision to include these categories
 
04:58:38.150 --> 04:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
of abuse again the cap on other abuse is
 
04:58:38.160 --> 04:58:40.190 align:start position:0%
of abuse again the cap on other abuse is
$250,000

04:58:40.190 --> 04:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
$250,000
 
04:58:42.230 --> 04:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
so the cap on sexual abuse that's not
 
04:58:45.670 --> 04:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
egregious remains 1.5 million while we
 
04:58:48.548 --> 04:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
have sort of expanded the other category
 
04:58:50.548 --> 04:58:50.558 align:start position:0%
from physical abuse to other abuse and
 
04:58:53.310 --> 04:58:53.320 align:start position:0%
added additional things the cap goes up
 
04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
from $150,000 to
 
04:58:57.628 --> 04:58:57.638 align:start position:0%
$250,000 for that category but it's
 
04:58:59.230 --> 04:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
still just
 
04:59:01.590 --> 04:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
$250,000 so I say that to just remind
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
the committee that there's still sort of
 
04:59:05.510 --> 04:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
tear of the values of the various
 
04:59:06.708 --> 04:59:06.718 align:start position:0%
categories of
 
04:59:10.070 --> 04:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
abuse for solitary confinement which
 
04:59:13.350 --> 04:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
which was a major uh topic of discussion
 
04:59:15.990 --> 04:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
the first time we discussed this in 2022
 
04:59:17.948 --> 04:59:17.958 align:start position:0%
the cap on that is
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
$150,000 so we felt it was important to
 
04:59:23.150 --> 04:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
acknowledge those victims who who
 
04:59:24.830 --> 04:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
suffered in
 
04:59:27.230 --> 04:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
unreasonably uh
 
04:59:30.230 --> 04:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
long um periods of solitary confinement
 
04:59:31.708 --> 04:59:31.718 align:start position:0%
we felt that it was important to
 
04:59:34.510 --> 04:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledge and compensate for that
 
04:59:36.510 --> 04:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's council have have shared
 
04:59:38.910 --> 04:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
with us studies that show that that can
 
04:59:41.270 --> 04:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
be really damaging to to a child but at
 
04:59:43.910 --> 04:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
the same time we you know we cap that
 
04:59:46.750 --> 04:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:49.230 --> 04:59:49.240 align:start position:0%
$150,000 the other two big things that
 
04:59:52.628 --> 04:59:52.638 align:start position:0%
this bill does and this again represents
 
04:59:55.190 --> 04:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
the compromise in exchange for expanding
 
04:59:58.030 --> 04:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
the scope and increasing the Caps the
 
05:00:00.470 --> 05:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
bill now provides that the administrator
 
05:00:02.910 --> 05:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
can decide that a claim could be paid
 
05:00:06.868 --> 05:00:06.878 align:start position:0%
over a period of years and the the
 
05:00:10.030 --> 05:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
reasons for this are are really two one
 
05:00:13.230 --> 05:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
there's a state interest in spreading
 
05:00:15.150 --> 05:00:15.160 align:start position:0%
out these payments over time because
 
05:00:17.110 --> 05:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
while we acknowledge that we need to do
 
05:00:18.670 --> 05:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
the right thing by these victims and we
 
05:00:21.110 --> 05:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
need to pay Fair compensation there's a
 
05:00:24.150 --> 05:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
reality to what the state can do
 
05:00:26.628 --> 05:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
financially and so this bill allows for
 
05:00:28.910 --> 05:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
some claims to be paid out over a period
 
05:00:31.948 --> 05:00:31.958 align:start position:0%
of years it caps the administrator's
 
05:00:34.110 --> 05:00:34.120 align:start position:0%
Authority I should say it obligates the
 
05:00:35.708 --> 05:00:35.718 align:start position:0%
administrator to monitor the fund
 
05:00:39.270 --> 05:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
balance and caps his authority uh to
 
05:00:42.350 --> 05:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
make payouts at no more than $75 million
 
05:00:45.110 --> 05:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
in any one fiscal year that number could
 
05:00:47.350 --> 05:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
go up for a particular fiscal year if he
 
05:00:49.350 --> 05:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
can come and get if he comes and gets
 
05:00:51.430 --> 05:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
approval from the executive counsel and
 
05:00:53.030 --> 05:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee I should say the
 
05:00:54.310 --> 05:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
governor and counsel and the fiscal
 
05:00:56.948 --> 05:00:56.958 align:start position:0%
committee but it generally imposes that
 
05:01:00.670 --> 05:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
$75 million Pere cap in order to enable
 
05:01:01.910 --> 05:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
the state to have some
 
05:01:03.590 --> 05:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
predictability and then as Senator
 
05:01:05.510 --> 05:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
Bradley mentioned there's a 5% interest
 
05:01:08.910 --> 05:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
for payments made made over time the
 
05:01:11.830 --> 05:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill also addressed is uh making the
 
05:01:14.350 --> 05:01:14.360 align:start position:0%
process more efficient and you know
 
05:01:16.150 --> 05:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
really the the major thing it does with
 
05:01:19.868 --> 05:01:19.878 align:start position:0%
that is that it it removes some of the
 
05:01:22.230 --> 05:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
mandatory timelines or gives more
 
05:01:24.750 --> 05:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility on the timelines but it also
 
05:01:26.230 --> 05:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
and this is very
 
05:01:29.708 --> 05:01:29.718 align:start position:0%
important um removes the obligation of
 
05:01:31.030 --> 05:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office the
 
05:01:32.788 --> 05:01:32.798 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's design to take a
 
05:01:35.350 --> 05:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
position on a claim
 
05:01:40.670 --> 05:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
before a claimant has had their uh
 
05:01:43.548 --> 05:01:43.558 align:start position:0%
um their uh Hearing in front of the
 
05:01:45.548 --> 05:01:45.558 align:start position:0%
administrator and the reason why that's
 
05:01:48.990 --> 05:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
important is this right now we at the
 
05:01:50.270 --> 05:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office take a
 
05:01:52.470 --> 05:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
position on a claim often before we've
 
05:01:55.230 --> 05:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
ever seen or heard from the
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
claimant and I think anyone who's worked
 
05:02:00.708 --> 05:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
with victims can tell you that without
 
05:02:03.430 --> 05:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
either you yourself talking to a victim
 
05:02:05.430 --> 05:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
or you yourself at least being able to
 
05:02:07.948 --> 05:02:07.958 align:start position:0%
listen to what a victim is saying listen
 
05:02:09.910 --> 05:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
to to what they have to say in their own
 
05:02:13.070 --> 05:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
words hear them testify it is very
 
05:02:15.430 --> 05:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
difficult to assess credibility and
 
05:02:17.350 --> 05:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
really think about how a claim should be
 
05:02:19.868 --> 05:02:19.878 align:start position:0%
valued the way this bill changes the
 
05:02:21.510 --> 05:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
process we will have much more of an
 
05:02:24.910 --> 05:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to do that to at least
 
05:02:26.990 --> 05:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
listen to a victim's testimony before we
 
05:02:28.868 --> 05:02:28.878 align:start position:0%
take a position on a claim and I think
 
05:02:30.788 --> 05:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
that's going to be really valuable for
 
05:02:30.798 --> 05:02:31.788 align:start position:0%
that's going to be really valuable for
the

05:02:31.788 --> 05:02:31.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:02:34.470 --> 05:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
process again the bill also extends the
 
05:02:36.990 --> 05:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
filing deadline to June 30th 2025 I
 
05:02:38.350 --> 05:02:38.360 align:start position:0%
think that's going to be important
 
05:02:39.310 --> 05:02:39.320 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have to rewrite
 
05:02:41.670 --> 05:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
the guidelin lines um the last point I
 
05:02:43.510 --> 05:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
will make and again there's a lot more I
 
05:02:44.910 --> 05:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
could cover here and I've already talked
 
05:02:46.788 --> 05:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
really longer than I intended to but
 
05:02:48.628 --> 05:02:48.638 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of information here I just
 
05:02:49.750 --> 05:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
want to make sure you have it because
 
05:02:53.470 --> 05:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
it's an important bill but um the the
 
05:02:58.230 --> 05:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
last point I will make is is
 
05:02:58.240 --> 05:03:00.230 align:start position:0%
last point I will make is is
this

05:03:00.230 --> 05:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:03:02.230 --> 05:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
the there's
 
05:03:05.030 --> 05:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
no I said it before there's no amount of
 
05:03:07.750 --> 05:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
money that can truly compensate for what
 
05:03:09.470 --> 05:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
happened to somebody for abuse you
 
05:03:11.070 --> 05:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
suffer for as a child there's just no
 
05:03:12.190 --> 05:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
amount of money that can truly
 
05:03:16.510 --> 05:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
compensate for that and there is an
 
05:03:18.548 --> 05:03:18.558 align:start position:0%
understandable desire for for many
 
05:03:21.948 --> 05:03:21.958 align:start position:0%
people myself included to want to be
 
05:03:24.430 --> 05:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
sure that we
 
05:03:27.670 --> 05:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
are that we're determining what happened
 
05:03:29.750 --> 05:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
to each victim with with enough
 
05:03:32.270 --> 05:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
certainty that we're paying the right
 
05:03:35.510 --> 05:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
amount of money um for a situation like
 
05:03:37.310 --> 05:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
this that involves so many victims that
 
05:03:39.910 --> 05:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
happened so many years ago
 
05:03:41.430 --> 05:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
never going to land we're never going to
 
05:03:43.948 --> 05:03:43.958 align:start position:0%
land on a perfect process right this
 
05:03:46.510 --> 05:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
this is per Perfection will never be
 
05:03:49.190 --> 05:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
something that we can achieve with this
 
05:03:51.350 --> 05:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
but I think our goal as a state should
 
05:03:54.510 --> 05:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
be to to make the best good faith effort
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
we can to pay some Fair compensation to
 
05:04:01.948 --> 05:04:01.958 align:start position:0%
people who suffered terrible abuse while
 
05:04:05.390 --> 05:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
in state care at the same time
 
05:04:06.788 --> 05:04:06.798 align:start position:0%
understanding that this is never going
 
05:04:08.590 --> 05:04:08.600 align:start position:0%
to be a perfect process but we need to
 
05:04:10.350 --> 05:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
do the best we can
 
05:04:12.230 --> 05:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
I think if we if we look at this
 
05:04:13.990 --> 05:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
legislation look at this process with
 
05:04:18.150 --> 05:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
that philosophy in mind then I think my
 
05:04:20.350 --> 05:04:20.360 align:start position:0%
hope would be that you would see the
 
05:04:22.830 --> 05:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
product you have before you as as an
 
05:04:25.750 --> 05:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
attempt to do that and as a fair
 
05:04:28.030 --> 05:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
compromise among people who have really
 
05:04:32.070 --> 05:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
worked hard in good faith to come to a
 
05:04:35.070 --> 05:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
process that can be a good alternative
 
05:04:38.470 --> 05:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
for the vast majority of victims um with
 
05:04:40.708 --> 05:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take questions and I
 
05:04:43.190 --> 05:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate you listening to my uh long
 
05:04:45.670 --> 05:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
explanation and long set of
 
05:04:49.230 --> 05:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
remarks um I I just have um a question
 
05:04:52.110 --> 05:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
so as an example where where the term
 
05:04:54.948 --> 05:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
egregious sexual abuse is in here is
 
05:04:57.110 --> 05:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
this a is this something that will just
 
05:04:59.430 --> 05:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
be a permanent a permanent new
 
05:05:02.628 --> 05:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
definition and statute no so this is a
 
05:05:04.750 --> 05:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
definition solely for purposes of the
 
05:05:08.708 --> 05:05:08.718 align:start position:0%
YDC okay yeah settlement process okay so
 
05:05:11.510 --> 05:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
um someday when we when this process has
 
05:05:14.628 --> 05:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
concluded this statute will disappear so
 
05:05:17.350 --> 05:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
this is not a permanent definition okay
 
05:05:20.510 --> 05:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah representative
 
05:05:22.708 --> 05:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you madam chair and thank
 
05:05:25.948 --> 05:05:25.958 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I'm just
 
05:05:28.150 --> 05:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
trying to understand this this isn't a
 
05:05:30.310 --> 05:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
judicial process this won't take place
 
05:05:31.990 --> 05:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
in court could you just give us a
 
05:05:34.350 --> 05:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
nutshell like somebody files a claim
 
05:05:36.190 --> 05:05:36.200 align:start position:0%
sure then when do you get the testimony
 
05:05:38.190 --> 05:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
and how does the administrator and who
 
05:05:40.430 --> 05:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
is he how do he get there and
 
05:05:42.270 --> 05:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
what happens so that they go through and
 
05:05:43.948 --> 05:05:43.958 align:start position:0%
pick this one and that one and whatever
 
05:05:46.910 --> 05:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
to come up with a solution for that
 
05:05:48.628 --> 05:05:48.638 align:start position:0%
particulars absolutely thank you
 
05:05:50.430 --> 05:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
representative yes so this this is
 
05:05:52.110 --> 05:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
separate from the judicial process it's
 
05:05:54.670 --> 05:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
meant to be an alternative to that
 
05:05:57.350 --> 05:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
because uh I think as many of you
 
05:06:02.030 --> 05:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
probably know or at least can can um
 
05:06:04.390 --> 05:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
ascertain uh if you file a lawsuit it
 
05:06:06.230 --> 05:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
takes years often to get it resolved
 
05:06:07.910 --> 05:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
right and this is so this is meant to be
 
05:06:10.110 --> 05:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
a a much more efficient way to resolve a
 
05:06:13.510 --> 05:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
claim so at a high
 
05:06:17.390 --> 05:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
level a claimant submits a claim form
 
05:06:18.990 --> 05:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
and there's a CL we went through this
 
05:06:21.070 --> 05:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
whole process in 2022 to develop what
 
05:06:23.030 --> 05:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
the claim form looks like claim and
 
05:06:24.310 --> 05:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
submits a claim form to the
 
05:06:26.670 --> 05:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
administrator's office the administrator
 
05:06:28.708 --> 05:06:28.718 align:start position:0%
determines makes a determination on when
 
05:06:30.788 --> 05:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
it's complete there might be a back and
 
05:06:32.670 --> 05:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
forth between the administrator's office
 
05:06:34.110 --> 05:06:34.120 align:start position:0%
and the claim in if there's missing
 
05:06:36.628 --> 05:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
information and the goal is really to to
 
05:06:39.030 --> 05:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
help help get all the information in the
 
05:06:41.990 --> 05:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
form that necessary to to look at the
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
claim um the way the process works right
 
05:06:47.390 --> 05:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
now is once a claim form is complete it
 
05:06:49.270 --> 05:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
gets sent to the Attorney General's
 
05:06:51.990 --> 05:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
office and the Attorney General's design
 
05:06:54.788 --> 05:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
reviews the claim and we take a position
 
05:06:57.868 --> 05:06:57.878 align:start position:0%
on what what we think the value should
 
05:07:00.430 --> 05:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
be and we can have a back and forth
 
05:07:02.948 --> 05:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
discussion with the claimant and if we
 
05:07:05.708 --> 05:07:05.718 align:start position:0%
can come to an agreement then the case
 
05:07:08.350 --> 05:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
we just settle the case if we can't come
 
05:07:11.070 --> 05:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
to an agreement then it's submitted to
 
05:07:13.270 --> 05:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
the administrator for for a for a
 
05:07:15.548 --> 05:07:15.558 align:start position:0%
hearing process and the administrator
 
05:07:17.868 --> 05:07:17.878 align:start position:0%
will ultimately make a decision on the
 
05:07:21.470 --> 05:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
value of the claim the way that we value
 
05:07:23.070 --> 05:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
the claim and the way the administrator
 
05:07:25.030 --> 05:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
values the claim is by using the
 
05:07:27.708 --> 05:07:27.718 align:start position:0%
guidelines that we developed back in
 
05:07:31.708 --> 05:07:31.718 align:start position:0%
2022 and those guidelines set out um
 
05:07:34.070 --> 05:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
what different instance incidents of
 
05:07:36.990 --> 05:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
abuse are are worth from a monetary
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
perspective so um I hate to use the word
 
05:07:42.070 --> 05:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
formula for something like this but it's
 
05:07:44.430 --> 05:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
kind of like a formula so we use a
 
05:07:46.510 --> 05:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
worksheet or claimant uses a worksheet
 
05:07:48.548 --> 05:07:48.558 align:start position:0%
we kind of use the same worksheet the
 
05:07:50.708 --> 05:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
administrator uses the same worksheet if
 
05:07:52.990 --> 05:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
if he has to decide the claim but that
 
05:07:55.030 --> 05:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
is at a high level generally the process
 
05:07:56.670 --> 05:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
our goals to have it take no more than
 
05:07:56.680 --> 05:07:58.310 align:start position:0%
our goals to have it take no more than
six

05:07:58.310 --> 05:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
six
 
05:07:58.320 --> 05:07:59.990 align:start position:0%
six
months

05:07:59.990 --> 05:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
months
 
05:08:02.270 --> 05:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
followup yeah my only followup would be
 
05:08:04.070 --> 05:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
so you have you you have some kind of
 
05:08:07.150 --> 05:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
formula that was developed in 2022 and
 
05:08:09.470 --> 05:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
then this bill just amends the various
 
05:08:11.390 --> 05:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
values and things and puts in new
 
05:08:13.430 --> 05:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
definitions so it's a combination of
 
05:08:16.350 --> 05:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
what you had in 2022 as amended by this
 
05:08:18.030 --> 05:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
bill and then that process as you
 
05:08:20.590 --> 05:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
described it yes thank you and and just
 
05:08:23.590 --> 05:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
to just to clarify for you um at risk of
 
05:08:24.868 --> 05:08:24.878 align:start position:0%
giving you more information than you
 
05:08:27.510 --> 05:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
asked for the the guidelines and and the
 
05:08:30.310 --> 05:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
claim form that were developed in 2022
 
05:08:31.788 --> 05:08:31.798 align:start position:0%
that was separate for the leg from the
 
05:08:33.830 --> 05:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
legislation we had to draft those in
 
05:08:35.628 --> 05:08:35.638 align:start position:0%
consultation with clayman's Council and
 
05:08:37.070 --> 05:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
then get them approved by the fiscal
 
05:08:39.868 --> 05:08:39.878 align:start position:0%
committee if this bill passes will have
 
05:08:41.670 --> 05:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
to do the same thing because there are
 
05:08:43.670 --> 05:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
changes being made in the legislation
 
05:08:45.150 --> 05:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
we'll have to go back through the fiscal
 
05:08:47.510 --> 05:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
committee working with climens Council
 
05:08:50.548 --> 05:08:50.558 align:start position:0%
and now the administrator to amend those
 
05:08:52.670 --> 05:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
guidelines and that formula and that
 
05:08:55.590 --> 05:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
worksheet and in order for this bill
 
05:08:58.310 --> 05:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
really to truly take effect thank you
 
05:09:00.708 --> 05:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
that helps a lot yep representative
 
05:09:00.718 --> 05:09:02.110 align:start position:0%
that helps a lot yep representative
Harry

05:09:02.110 --> 05:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
Harry
 
05:09:05.150 --> 05:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
gther thank you madam chair um my
 
05:09:07.270 --> 05:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
question is um the administrator since
 
05:09:08.830 --> 05:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
they have the opportunity to make the
 
05:09:12.350 --> 05:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
decisions the final decision um is there
 
05:09:14.990 --> 05:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
anything in there say if a person is 60
 
05:09:19.990 --> 05:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
versus 40 and um just a question if
 
05:09:21.948 --> 05:09:21.958 align:start position:0%
you're 60 your lifespan is probably a
 
05:09:24.590 --> 05:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
little bit shorter and if you're 40
 
05:09:27.030 --> 05:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
might be a little longer so is there
 
05:09:28.910 --> 05:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
anything in there that says that based
 
05:09:32.230 --> 05:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
on age or something that um that might
 
05:09:34.548 --> 05:09:34.558 align:start position:0%
help to form the decision rather to pay
 
05:09:37.910 --> 05:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
immediately or go over spand of time
 
05:09:39.868 --> 05:09:39.878 align:start position:0%
yeah so serous yeah thank you for the
 
05:09:41.430 --> 05:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
question I think it's it's a really good
 
05:09:43.590 --> 05:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
one yeah it's ultimately up to the
 
05:09:45.910 --> 05:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
administrator as to whether to award a
 
05:09:48.070 --> 05:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
claim in a lump sum or have the claim
 
05:09:50.948 --> 05:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
paid out over a period of years and
 
05:09:54.350 --> 05:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
while there's no set list of criteria
 
05:09:55.708 --> 05:09:55.718 align:start position:0%
that the administrator has to consider
 
05:09:57.830 --> 05:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
when deciding that he has discretion and
 
05:10:00.070 --> 05:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
I can tell you in talking with
 
05:10:01.910 --> 05:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's counsil and talking with the
 
05:10:03.830 --> 05:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
administrator I think that's certainly
 
05:10:05.150 --> 05:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
something that would be taken into
 
05:10:08.350 --> 05:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
account whether someone is older or we
 
05:10:11.150 --> 05:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
have had claim in who who might be ill
 
05:10:12.628 --> 05:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
and may not think they have a very long
 
05:10:15.430 --> 05:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
life expectancy and I think in those
 
05:10:17.750 --> 05:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
situations that certainly would be more
 
05:10:19.548 --> 05:10:19.558 align:start position:0%
likely to either be a lump sum or at
 
05:10:21.430 --> 05:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
least a payment maybe over two or three
 
05:10:24.670 --> 05:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
years as opposed to five or six thank
 
05:10:27.430 --> 05:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
you y representative
 
05:10:30.310 --> 05:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
Pratt hello thank you for the questions
 
05:10:32.750 --> 05:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
um I have a question has anybody since
 
05:10:34.708 --> 05:10:34.718 align:start position:0%
this all started the reporting has any
 
05:10:35.910 --> 05:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
children passed
 
05:10:38.708 --> 05:10:38.718 align:start position:0%
away has any of these 1400 people passed
 
05:10:38.718 --> 05:10:40.788 align:start position:0%
away has any of these 1400 people passed
away

05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
away
 
05:10:44.350 --> 05:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know that off the top of my
 
05:10:48.670 --> 05:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
head what I can tell you is that the way
 
05:10:51.788 --> 05:10:51.798 align:start position:0%
we have what the way the bill addresses
 
05:10:54.750 --> 05:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
that is once a claim is filed if someone
 
05:10:58.030 --> 05:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
passes away their estate can continue
 
05:11:00.830 --> 05:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
with the claims process um if you
 
05:11:03.070 --> 05:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
haven't filed a claim yet the estate
 
05:11:05.310 --> 05:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
can't file a claim they can't but I
 
05:11:08.230 --> 05:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
don't know whether anyone has has passed
 
05:11:11.628 --> 05:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
away on that note you know I can um and
 
05:11:13.430 --> 05:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
this addresses I think representative
 
05:11:16.868 --> 05:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
Muse's question from earlier outside of
 
05:11:19.750 --> 05:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
this process the attorney general has
 
05:11:23.110 --> 05:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
the authority to settle settle any case
 
05:11:25.110 --> 05:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
and the cap is actually it's quite a bit
 
05:11:26.868 --> 05:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
higher than Senator Bradley mentioned
 
05:11:30.150 --> 05:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
the cap is all the way up to um I think
 
05:11:33.590 --> 05:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's you know 1/4 of 1% uh for a
 
05:11:36.590 --> 05:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
particular claim or case 1/4 of 1% of
 
05:11:40.310 --> 05:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
the previous year's uh general fund
 
05:11:42.708 --> 05:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
revenues so that's about up to $5
 
05:11:45.030 --> 05:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
million for a case so we have a lot of
 
05:11:47.230 --> 05:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
flexibility to settle a case even
 
05:11:50.110 --> 05:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
outside of this process and we would
 
05:11:52.510 --> 05:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
always consider I mean the job of the
 
05:11:53.868 --> 05:11:53.878 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice is always to
 
05:11:55.868 --> 05:11:55.878 align:start position:0%
consider the interests of justice and if
 
05:11:59.590 --> 05:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
there were a unique case like that we
 
05:12:01.788 --> 05:12:01.798 align:start position:0%
would certainly or for that reason or
 
05:12:04.190 --> 05:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
for another reason we would consider
 
05:12:06.990 --> 05:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
using that authority to to do justice
 
05:12:11.910 --> 05:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:14.670 --> 05:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:12:17.390 --> 05:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
scitec I can't resist did formala
 
05:12:18.910 --> 05:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
developed the
 
05:12:22.270 --> 05:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
formula uh prob would you agree that the
 
05:12:24.390 --> 05:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
most important part of your testimony is
 
05:12:28.708 --> 05:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:32.310 --> 05:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
bradick I would say that I yeah I think
 
05:12:33.628 --> 05:12:33.638 align:start position:0%
it's important that the
 
05:12:35.948 --> 05:12:35.958 align:start position:0%
administrator is someone like John
 
05:12:38.190 --> 05:12:38.200 align:start position:0%
bradrick who served as the Chief Justice
 
05:12:41.230 --> 05:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
of the Hampshire Supreme Court and is
 
05:12:44.990 --> 05:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know clearly I think respected in
 
05:12:48.430 --> 05:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
the bar so yeah yeah I think that who
 
05:12:50.350 --> 05:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
the administrator is is always an
 
05:12:52.948 --> 05:12:52.958 align:start position:0%
important question and yes the fact that
 
05:12:54.590 --> 05:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
it's John bradick someone that the state
 
05:12:56.110 --> 05:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
trusted to be the Chief Justice of our
 
05:12:58.350 --> 05:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court should give people
 
05:13:03.948 --> 05:13:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:06.470 --> 05:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
work all right see no more questions
 
05:13:07.670 --> 05:13:07.680 align:start position:0%

05:13:09.910 --> 05:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
