00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
I will start by uh welcoming everybody
 
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
asking you to please silence your phones
 
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
if they have not been yet as a
 
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
reminder and um there are a lot of
 
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 align:start position:0%
people to speak on this bill coming up
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
as our first bill so I wanted to um also
 
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
mention that if you you handed in a card
 
00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
to speak and somebody else has already
 
00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
said everything that you were going to
 
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
say and you don't feel like you want to
 
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 align:start position:0%
say anything it's perfectly okay to just
 
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
wave off and say no I'm not going to and
 
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
we'll just pass by okay uh don't feel
 
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
like you have to get up just because we
 
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
call you if you don't have anything to
 
00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 align:start position:0%
say at that point um and if you have do
 
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 align:start position:0%
want to speak and haven't handed in a
 
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 align:start position:0%
card yet please fill one in and pass it
 
00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 align:start position:0%
Forward um the order that I try to go
 
00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
through these cards to have uh the after
 
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor introduces we try to
 
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
go to the general public who's here on
 
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 align:start position:0%
their time uh and as a courtesy let them
 
00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 align:start position:0%
get back on with their day we'll then go
 
00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 align:start position:0%
to the department and then any lobbyists
 
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
that have been showing up and with that
 
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
I will open the public hearing on hb720
 
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the importation and sale of
 
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
state the chair recognizes Patrick long
 
00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
the prime
 
00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
bill good morning Mr chairman members of
 
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
the committee uh I'm Patrick en long aka
 
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
the other Pat long uh representing
 
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 26 and I want to start off
 
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
with uh a story about my personal
 
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
connection to this bill uh so I grew up
 
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
in Tennessee and I will confess that I
 
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
have never caught a bass or a trout
 
00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 align:start position:0%
because I don't have the attention span
 
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh but what I did catch a lot of in the
 
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
first 16 years of my life was Tennessee
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
shiners uh and I would use them to catch
 
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
frogs and was hoping to use the frogs to
 
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
catch snakes to freak my grandma out but
 
00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 align:start position:0%
unfortunately going back to my short
 
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
attention span never succeeded in that
 
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.790 align:start position:0%
attention span never succeeded in that
but

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
um one thing I learned from my uh
 
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
catching all these shiners is that they
 
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
are an invasive species in several of
 
00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
the neighboring states and so that
 
00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
brought home to me our responsibility to
 
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.230 align:start position:0%
brought home to me our responsibility to
protect

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
protect
 
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
uh our ecology protect our ecosystems
 
00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
from invasive
 
00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
species You could argue maybe I should
 
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
be cheering on my native Spa States
 
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
Wildlife uh taking over new places but I
 
00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's the responsible
 
00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
thing to
 
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
do so this is a proactive step to
 
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
protect our Fisheries from invasive
 
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
species and Aquatic diseases before they
 
00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
become widespread uh costly problems the
 
00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
importation of bait fish is one of the
 
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
most significant Pathways for
 
00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
introducing invasive species and harmful
 
00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
pathogens into our Waters these fish
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
often farmed in States like Aransas are
 
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
transported here in water that can carry
 
00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
microscopic hitchhikers uh plant
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
fragments invasive larvi uh and Aquatic
 
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
diseases but it's not just the water uh
 
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 align:start position:0%
the fish themselves can be invasive
 
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
species or can carry harmful pathogens
 
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
that threaten our
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
ecosystems uh New Hampshire does require
 
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
permits for Bait fish Imports and those
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
permits are only granted to suppliers in
 
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
states with disease monitoring programs
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
however uh this approach puts control in
 
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
the hands of other states rather than
 
00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 align:start position:0%
protecting New Hampshire directly uh
 
00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
even well-regulated programs only test
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
for a limited set of known
 
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
pathogens uh meaning new or emergency
 
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
dise or emerging diseases can still slip
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
through uh additionally these programs
 
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
don't test for a species type so there
 
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
is no monitoring for invasive species uh
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
studies conducted in other states have
 
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
found invasive species and harmful
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
pathogens in The Bait fish trade uh even
 
00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
when those certification requirements
 
00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:45.790 align:start position:0%
when those certification requirements
were

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:48.919 align:start position:0%
followed uh once invasive species are
 
00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
introduced they're nearly impossible to
 
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
eliminate for example the Asian basket
 
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
clam which is already established in New
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh has cost us over a billion
 
00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:00.039 align:start position:0%
dollars in damag
 
00:08:03.309 --> 00:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
by clogging water systems and disrupting
 
00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
ecosystems while this bill won't address
 
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
species already here it will help
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
prevent future introductions before they
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
become the next costly
 
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
problem New Hampshire would be joining
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
other states in taking action Maine
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
Minnesota Utah Montana Oregon and Alaska
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
have all implemented similar or stricter
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
regulations to protect their Fisheries
 
00:08:30.149 --> 00:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
from invasive species and disease
 
00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:31.639 align:start position:0%
and two things you'll notice about that
 
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
list of states first thing you notice is
 
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
probably that this is not all blue
 
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
States this is a mix of blue states red
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
States purple States this is not a part
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
as an issue it's just about protecting
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
our Fisheries the second thing you'll
 
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
notice uh a lot of the critics of the
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
bill have claimed that it will destroy
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
ice fishing in New Hampshire but several
 
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
of those States uh Alaska Minnesota
 
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
Maine Montana and Idaho
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
are big ice fishing States and similar
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
or stricter regulations have not
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
destroyed ice fishing
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
there uh to be clear uh so I've
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
submitted an amendment uh to clarify the
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
bill and make sure it only applies to
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
importation from out of state uh and
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't affect saltwater uh
 
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
fishing so this would only
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
impact uh importations from out of state
 
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
does not impact the Harvest or sale of
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
bait fish within New Hampshire engers
 
00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:36.519 align:start position:0%
will still be able to use live bait and
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
local bait shops can uh continue selling
 
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
locally har Bait fish harvested Bait
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
fish uh this is a common sense measure
 
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
to protect New Hampshire's Fisheries
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation economy and Aquatic
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
ecosystems and I encourage you all to
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
support this
 
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you um do you have a copy of
 
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
that amendment that you
 
00:10:01.069 --> 00:10:01.079 align:start position:0%
uh had submitted uh I do not have a copy
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
with me today I emailed you a copy I can
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
provide another distribute a copy to the
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
committee but um having a paper copy
 
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
would be um good if you can go to the
 
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
fourth floor and get some copies made I
 
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
can Prov time we exec we would have that
 
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
handy thank you I can do that after
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
lunch if that would work for the
 
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
committee that's fine um is anybody have
 
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.829 align:start position:0%
committee that's fine um is anybody have
any

00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
questions representative Harvey thank
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
question so uh you're saying that um
 
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
bait shops could still have locally
 
00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:39.399 align:start position:0%
harvested Bait fish um in their shop
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
right um so where do they get
 
00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:46.839 align:start position:0%
those well from the local
 
00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
waterways oh so they catch them a
 
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:55.240 align:start position:0%
followup followup so they are harvesting
 
00:10:58.629 --> 00:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
those local fish on their own or is
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
there some place that they purchase them
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
from that's what's confusing me
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh I am not aware of how they currently
 
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
do it but certainly they could make
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
arrangements to either catch them on
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
their own or uh contract that workout
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
the same way that they buy bait fish
 
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
from out of state now you just have to
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative tutor thank you
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
question I guess I'm just to go how you
 
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
would enforce this I mean how would you
 
00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:36.839 align:start position:0%
tell a Pittsburgh Shiner from an
 
00:11:39.629 --> 00:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
Arkansas one
 
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
well uh I think you would want to ask a
 
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
biologist that there are lots of
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
um the I mean right now there's already
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
a licensing procedure in place for out
 
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.430 align:start position:0%
a licensing procedure in place for out
ofate

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
ofate
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
importations so we know where the fish
 
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
are coming
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
from we know who
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
um so I think there's yeah there may be
 
00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
some difficulty in enforcement but I I
 
00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:19.959 align:start position:0%
think I think it's like enforcing any
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
other law you do inspections and you
 
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
on representative KH
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman representative
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my questions uh if
 
00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
I understand right that you mentioned
 
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
that uh you for your fishing habit you
 
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
didn't use
 
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
any uh uh bait the bait we are talking
 
00:12:48.189 --> 00:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
about but I was wondering what motivated
 
00:12:51.389 --> 00:12:51.399 align:start position:0%
you to introduce this bill well I
 
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
believe in uh protecting our environment
 
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
our local ecosystems um and making sure
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
people can enjoy the great outdoors
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:05.079 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
Durkin thank you Mr speaker thank you
 
00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:10.839 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um how many
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
times uh in the last say 15 years have
 
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
we had a report of any uh infected Bait
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
fish uh in the state whether it's
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
imported or uh caught local as a native
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
I not sure about the answer to that
 
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
representative and I'm not sure that we
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
would have a report even if it was
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
infected uh because we are relying on
 
00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
the reporting from uh Arkansas's system
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
or whatever state they're coming
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
from followup followup and uh part two
 
00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:45.079 align:start position:0%
of that would be as far as an invasive
 
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
species have we had any reports of
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
whether imported of invasive species or
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh local St uh neighboring states having
 
00:13:54.389 --> 00:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
any invasive
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
species um well certainly we've had the
 
00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:00.519 align:start position:0%
Asian basket Clan demonstrating that
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
sorry as far as a bait fish so a lot of
 
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
the fish that are used
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
are not native here some of them uh
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
there's speculation that they couldn't
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
establish their populations locally
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
because it's too cold here but uh there
 
00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
was the same issue with the Asian basket
 
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
clam uh initially it was believed that
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
it couldn't reproduce here because it
 
00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
was too cold uh and there's ice in the
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
water too much the year uh so people
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
didn't take it seriously enough when it
 
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:36.279 align:start position:0%
infestation representative
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
Fox no okay any other further
 
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
Rollins you need to come up to the if
 
00:15:02.829 --> 00:15:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
and the button for the microphone is
 
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
on all right thank you um my name is
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
Doug Rollins um I'm a native to uh the
 
00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I'm also an Avid
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
Angler uh Sportsman um and my family is
 
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
as well I am a local real estate agent
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
and I am also a local business business
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
owner I own the winnisquam bait and
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
tackle shop on Lake
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
winnisquam um we
 
00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
currently um rely heavily on this
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
business in the winter months as you
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
know um in The Lakes Region it's a
 
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
resort area a lot of the businesses die
 
00:15:52.309 --> 00:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
down and uh since Co we have a ton of
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
people moving to the state of New
 
00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the lifestyle that we
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
provide with the sporting of fish
 
00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:00.790 align:start position:0%
provide with the sporting of fish
and

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
whatnot um I think I believe this bill
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
is very premature if not
 
00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
ridiculous um we've had several years
 
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
and it's been commented there's never
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
been any indication that there's any
 
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
invasive species coming into the state
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
um we rely heavily on the importation of
 
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
smelt and shiners currently um as the
 
00:16:27.629 --> 00:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
years have gone by several bait shops
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
have gone out of business
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
a lot of mom and pop shops have gone out
 
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
of business alls you have left of the
 
00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
Big Bass Pros and whatnot which can't
 
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
keep up with the demand of local
 
00:16:43.309 --> 00:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
fisheries and nor do they understand the
 
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
local lakes and ponds and the fish that
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
uh we rely on um in that um fashion I
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
also believe that during the winter
 
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
months I can speak for myself it could
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
be upwards to almost 70% of our business
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
um we have a convenience store as part
 
00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:05.559 align:start position:0%
of our Bait and Tackle but if we didn't
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
have the bait fish um importation we
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
would be very strained on business
 
00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
during the winter months so for that
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
reason um I oppose this bill and um I I
 
00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:21.559 align:start position:0%
don't believe there's any scientific
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
evidence that shows that um there's a
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
huge impact because we're bringing
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
shiners and smel into the state the
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
fishing game already requires us to be
 
00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:34.039 align:start position:0%
licensed they know what's coming in we
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
report the numbers um and I have not
 
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
seen any indication or evidence of any
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
impact of uh any type of an issue
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
because we do this so that's pretty much
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
yet for me thank you are there any
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative Harvey so you
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
you might be the person that I should
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
ask my former question to
 
00:17:58.029 --> 00:17:58.039 align:start position:0%
um where do you get your locally
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
harvested bit fish there are um several
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
well i' say several there's actually
 
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
very few uh local Trappers that we rely
 
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
on and they're usually young people that
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
are that have the time or people that
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
can get out and trap bait and streams
 
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
and trap smelt uh they have to have a
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
license that's uh monitored through the
 
00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:22.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire fishing game and I'm sure
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
you'll hear about that later um but
 
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
there just isn't enough people to
 
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
sustain the need I mean you've seen the
 
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
amount of people that have moved to the
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I see it on both
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
sides because I'm also a real estate
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
agent we've sold homes to people coming
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
into they're flooding into this state
 
00:18:41.549 --> 00:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
for the way of life that we want to
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
preserve and Bait fish is a huge part of
 
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
it um and I think that uh you know you
 
00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
just don't have enough local Trappers to
 
00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
sustain like you said an individual
 
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
would have to go out trap their own bait
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
or we rely on a hand full of guys that
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
trap bait and and it's just not enough
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
to to cover what we need follow up
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
follow up so um I'm GNA ask a question
 
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
and it's probably going to be obvious
 
00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:15.799 align:start position:0%
that my husband fishes but I don't um so
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
but I I'm GNA ask the question anyway so
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
um is it possible are I I understand
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
going out and
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
trapping Bait fish my husband does that
 
00:19:31.149 --> 00:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
with a no trap and so forth so but is is
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
it possible to have um Fisheries
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
that um grow
 
00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:42.919 align:start position:0%
or um maintain Bait fish for uh stores
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
like I'm sure that you know U other
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
states have Farms Fish Farms um that
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
they could do but obviously we don't
 
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
have that here at this point in time I
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
mean somewhere in the future maybe but
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
um currently I mean to have it supported
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
in uh from outside sources or out of
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
state sources um doesn't seem to be
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
affecting us greatly as far as any
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
impact on the waters um and and quite
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
frankly even if you had Bait fish in the
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
state that we were trapping how like
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
this gentleman said how are you going to
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
monitor and tell what's an invasive
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
species versus on a Shiner and you're
 
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
certainly not going to see something
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
microscopic that comes in on a fish on
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
their scales on a Shiner that big um so
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
I you know I just don't think that it's
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
impactful enough to even uh have this
 
00:20:41.789 --> 00:20:41.799 align:start position:0%
bill even move forward at this
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
time any further
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
Durkin thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so let me
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
understand this the state of New
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has no Fisheries that raise
 
00:20:59.230 --> 00:20:59.240 align:start position:0%
specifically freshwater bait
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
fish I can't answer that probably the
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
colonel could answer that the colonel
 
00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:05.559 align:start position:0%
could answer that
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
definitely Fisher Chief could y so why
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
don't you hold that question then until
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
we have them okay and the other part
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
about that if they don't I don't know
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
how the streams are down here but up
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
north in uh the North country most of
 
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
those frams are streams this time of
 
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
year are frozen so for somebody to go
 
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
out and catch that how are they going to
 
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
do that uh is several you're going to
 
00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
hear from several bait guys here today
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
from some of the faces I've seen guys
 
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
work hard to go out and trap bait and it
 
00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
is difficult you have to fish through
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
the ice you have to cut if it's even
 
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
allowed in certain areas a lot of our
 
00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
ponds and lakes have been shut down
 
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
because of the low population of bait
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
fish in some areas um but yeah like you
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
said there as far as I know there isn't
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
a an area to get bait fish locally that
 
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
would sustain the the supply that we
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
need followup follow up so um also let
 
00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
me understand that this time of the year
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
or if there are no Fisheries in New
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are raising those that
 
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
type of bait that you would rely solely
 
00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
on Native
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
CAU at this time of the year
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
correct representative KH thank you Mr
 
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you sir for taking my
 
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
supply and demand you know the if Supply
 
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
is less you know demand is there you
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
know what happens the prices goes up
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
please tell us that if this bill goes in
 
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
implementing situation what is going to
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
happen what kind of price we looking for
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
and you know what what is going to
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
happen we've already seen a massive
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
increase in the price of bait fish um I
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
can't speak for going back into the
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
early 40s or 50 but I know right now
 
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
currently a dozen of smelt uh one smelt
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
is a dollar or more um we can buy it
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
wholesale for half that price and we're
 
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
selling a a dozen uh smelt for $14 a
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
dozen um so and it's because of supply
 
00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.039 align:start position:0%
and demand we can't even get it from out
 
00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:24.039 align:start position:0%
of state um in numbers enough to sustain
 
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
when we have fishing Derby's we just got
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
done with the Meredith fishing derby and
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
I I know there's several bait dealers
 
00:23:33.149 --> 00:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
behind me that we ran out and we barely
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
had enough to support the fishermen for
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
the deres so like I said we need to rely
 
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
on out estate importation of bait
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
heavily right
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
now representative
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
Harvey um so this might be another one
 
00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:56.200 align:start position:0%
of my questions but that's okay um I
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
know I went fishing I didn't go fishing
 
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
I went with my husband while he fished
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
on rangley Lake the smelt could not be
 
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
alive when he fished and the guide
 
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
actually killed the smelt in front of
 
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
him to make sure that we knew it was
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
dead do does that happen a lot because
 
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking if the bait fish is not
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
alive then it can't produce an invasive
 
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
species is is that common that you fish
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
with a dead we we don't current we don't
 
00:24:29.549 --> 00:24:29.559 align:start position:0%
have a a dead bait law um for smelt and
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
shiners it's live bait um you can't bait
 
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
a treble hook and there's some other
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
laws but that doesn't affect whether
 
00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
bait any further
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
even my name is Wayne Hall owner of WH
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
Sports coner New Hampshire I've been a
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:20.389 --> 00:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
um AJ they spoke very very well there's
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
nothing I can add to that with the
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
exception of I think what we really
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
would need to worry about is if we do
 
00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
all start trapping what's going to
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
happen happen to the infrastructure or a
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
bait fish for a predator fish when the
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
source is depleted what
 
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
happens okay if there's no way if we
 
00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
take take take take take take take okay
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
we can all trap we could all probably
 
00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
find time we could hire people and stuff
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
like that what happens to the natural
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
resource when your Predator fish don't
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
have anything to
 
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
eat we've actually seen some over
 
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
fishing happen and the colonel can
 
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
probably say in two or three lakes and
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
rivers used to have a beautiful run of
 
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
rainbow smell you used to dip some up
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
and get them for in the spring and have
 
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
them for a snack and stuff like that you
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
know which they are at a the rainbow
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
smell and now they're clean and there's
 
00:26:13.149 --> 00:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
no more smell so what happens I mean
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
that would be my biggest thing um and I
 
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
do believe and the colonel again could
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
answer this that all the tanks that we
 
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:25.640 align:start position:0%
buy our fish from have to be
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
inspected they can't just import fish
 
00:26:32.389 --> 00:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
from Joe's place down in t uh down in uh
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
Tennessee or Arkansas and not have him I
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
think does the water have to be tested
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
Colonel but you know there's a lot
 
00:26:45.389 --> 00:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
there's they just can't import fish
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
without a certain amount of testing and
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
stuff like that this would severely
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
detriment because I am the sole owner of
 
00:26:52.559 --> 00:26:53.669 align:start position:0%
detriment because I am the sole owner of
WH

00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
WH
 
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
Sports so there's no way I can go out
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
and trust this a bill like this would AB
 
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely put us right out of business
 
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
there be no there's no way you know um
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
but like I said my biggest concern would
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
be the natural resources what what what
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
would this do to our natural
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
resources thank you any
 
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:22.909 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
testimony

00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Rebecca meren um I have
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
two bait shops one in Barnstead and one
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
in Meredith um we opened our first bait
 
00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
shop about 15 years ago um this bill
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
would definitely um do damage to our
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
business I have my trapping license my
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
son has his trapping license my husband
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
has his trapping license when we first
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
started we were all trapping we can not
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
trap enough to keep up with the demand
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
for our stores there's no way it's
 
00:28:02.029 --> 00:28:02.039 align:start position:0%
impossible even with having other people
 
00:28:05.509 --> 00:28:05.519 align:start position:0%
trap for us which we have had um and
 
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
I'll be I've been out with my son 8:00
 
00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039 align:start position:0%
at night pulling traps and you know
 
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
trying to help um and it's it's too much
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
there's no way we could trap enough to
 
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
meet up with the demand and I don't
 
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
believe it would only affect us as bait
 
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
shop owners but people travel from all
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
over to fish in New Hampshire and
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
they're getting they're renting h hotels
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
they're getting airbnbs they're going to
 
00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
restaurants they're going to gift shops
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
anybody that relies on tourism will also
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
be affected by this um so I I believe
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
it's going to have a huge impact if we
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
do that and I know every time we get a
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
delivery we have a paper handed to us
 
00:28:48.509 --> 00:28:48.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%

in the business can you tell us
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
any beop owner supports this bill I
 
00:29:08.669 --> 00:29:08.679 align:start position:0%
don't know of a single bait shop owner
 
00:29:12.269 --> 00:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
that would support this Bill thank you

Hampshire fishing game department has
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
already taken great steps to

robust umbrella of protection but will
 
00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:52.039 align:start position:0%
continue to provide that protection the
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%

Authority occurs in other states with
 
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
the fish health testing but that is
 
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
actually incorrect I personally review
 
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
the results of all the fish health
 
00:31:44.909 --> 00:31:44.919 align:start position:0%
testing that comes into this state and
 
00:31:48.029 --> 00:31:48.039 align:start position:0%
on top of that I ALS as part of the
 
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
observations I'm also in charge of
 
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
assessing the geographic risk of where
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
these fish are coming in the facility

plans to our knowledge and to our
 
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
understanding this bill was proposed
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
with no specific incident of bait fish
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
being directly linked to an introduction
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
of a new pathogen or invasive species
 
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
this actually more commonly occurs in
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
incidences where in the US where illegal
 
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
release of ornamental fish from personal
 
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
fish tanks
 
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:32.200 align:start position:0%
occur but we already have that addressed
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
in FIS
 
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
release thank you everyone um so as far
 
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
as the impacts there are also beyond the
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
testing if this was approved there are
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
definitely going to be impacts related
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
to the economy as you've previously
 
00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
heard as well as biological biological
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
impacts to our state Fisheries So
 
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
currently we are um going through this
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
process regulatory to allow clean native
 
00:33:15.149 --> 00:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
fish species into the state we do not
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
allow non-native species that's really
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
important to note because the idea of
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
invasives through this method is not an
 
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
option we only allow native species they
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
are ided they are
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
tested so if this was allowed um
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
approved to go through the sheer numbers
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
alone so bait dealers right now are
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
currently importing about 800,000 and
 
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
900,000 Bait fish into the state
 
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
annually and as you've heard taking
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
those numbers from our natural water
 
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
bodies within State could absolutely be
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the biological component
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:00.440 align:start position:0%
fishery the the other aspect is that um
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
it would impact our angling public so as
 
00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
a result Anglers would either have to
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
catch their own bait or um it could
 
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
actually result in illegal bait coming
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
across state lines where um folks are
 
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
bringing in bait from other states that
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
are close to them and they're not
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
getting a health certificate or or a
 
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
permit and so that absolutely could lead
 
00:34:28.589 --> 00:34:28.599 align:start position:0%
to um problematic invasive species and
 
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
disease uh
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
pathogen as well as they could also not
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
fish which gets into the impact of us
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
because of course our license sales are
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
our primary source of funding and those
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
license sales would go down if Anglers
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
were no longer
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
fishing so in our economy um someone had
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned we sell about 50,000 licenses
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
annually that brings about $6.2 million
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
in Revenue to us as well as contributes
 
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
about 338 million um dollars to the
 
00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
economy of New
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as the gentleman previously
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned with hotels and the um lady as
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
well with hotels and various visitors
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
and Anglers from other
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
areas so again um for Bait fish
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
retailers this is part of their business
 
00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
and of course if their businesses go out
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
then so does my opportunity for Anglers
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
potential opportunity for Anglers to go
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
fishing it's all directly related it's a
 
00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
big giant Circle and as far as this goes
 
00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the build the purpose of
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
the introduction of this was for to
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
prevent non-native species and promote
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
Fisheries in New Hampshire and we think
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
e economically it would not promote
 
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:55.720 align:start position:0%
fishing and um biologically it would not
 
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
promote Anglers to go fishing with
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
without proper bait and it would
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely have an impact to our wild
 
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
waterways so ID Fish ID is definitely an
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
issue if folks don't know what the
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
species are in the water body they have
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
no idea if it's an invasive or not and
 
00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
we have tons of native minnows and there
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
are also lots of other minnows in other
 
00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:22.599 align:start position:0%
areas other states that are not native
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
to here so folks would not necessarily
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
know what they're dealing with if
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
they're out on their own as well as the
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
fact that we do not have any instate
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
testing for those folks that are pulling
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
bait from our natural Waters so we would
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
not have any recollection or knowledge
 
00:36:43.309 --> 00:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
or ability to monitor um the fish health
 
00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
in those waterways as well as um how how
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
many are being
 
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
harvested the other aspect is the um
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
poor fishing condition of the if you
 
00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
take away the food chain you're going to
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
have issues with our fish health and
 
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
fish condition in those particular
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
waterways as you've heard there's a lot
 
00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
of bait fish that are being imported and
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
if we were to take that bottom of the
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
food chain in our own water bodies we
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
would absolutely potentially have an
 
00:37:21.069 --> 00:37:21.079 align:start position:0%
impact to our Fisheries which would then
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity and with that I just want to
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that um I just reiterate again
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
we do not our testing currently
 
00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:38.599 align:start position:0%
prohibits the import of non-native
 
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
species it prohibits the import of
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
unclean fish from unclean facilities and
 
00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
we do not have testing within state from
 
00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
those fish that are harvested and again
 
00:37:56.109 --> 00:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
ID and biological impact would be
 
00:37:56.119 --> 00:37:58.150 align:start position:0%
ID and biological impact would be
prominent

00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
prominent
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
would you please um go over the fiscal
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
note that you just delivered to the
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
committee today sure so um attached in
 
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
your packet is our testimony both Matt
 
00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:11.240 align:start position:0%
and myself as well as the fiscal note
 
00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for not getting that in
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
earlier um our legal coordinator has
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
been out on personal illness and
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this was one of the fiscal
 
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:23.720 align:start position:0%
notes that was missed so um it's
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
attached in your packet I will um get
 
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
that to you as well electronically but
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
in that fiscal note it identifies our
 
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
license component and as well as the um
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
Bait fish reala retailers um information
 
00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
for the last 3 years as well as the
 
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.430 align:start position:0%
for the last 3 years as well as the
economic

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
economic
 
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
impact and what was that economic impact
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
if you could just give us an overview
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
real quick sure so in 2022 retailers
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
imported about 800 sorry excuse me 900
 
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
,000 Bait fish in 2023 and 24 they
 
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
imported about
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
800,000 and that equaled in their um
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
Revenue to about
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
$800,000 that would be lost um to the
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
state and again that could result in
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
closure of shops which of course would
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
then lead to our decline in license
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
sales so we sell again about 150,000
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
licenses a year which is roughly $6.2
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
million in Revenue to fishing game and
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
again 3.8 million to the New Hampshire
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
economy thank you any questions Repcon I
 
00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:35.079 align:start position:0%
saw your hand several times while I was
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
still asking questions you can go first
 
00:39:40.589 --> 00:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chairman uh my
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
question is if you please uh explain to
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
me that uh if this industry is highly
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
regulated uh i' like to know that uh
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
when you when somebody Imports
 
00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
those bait and also somebody catches
 
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.589 --> 00:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
regulate so are you talking about the
 
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
testing testing
 
00:40:15.069 --> 00:40:15.079 align:start position:0%
yes so the permitting a bait dealer has
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
a bait dealer's license they are allowed
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
to fill out an importation permit with
 
00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:21.640 align:start position:0%
that importation permit they have to
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
request the fish health certificate
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
testing so that includes bacteriology
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
ver olog parasitology and molecular
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
Diagnostics as the backing to prove that
 
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
these fish are negative for the specific
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
path pathogens we are looking at from
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
there they send them to me and in New
 
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you are required to have three
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
consecutive years of testing clean
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
before we would even approve it once I
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
have that then I go through and go and
 
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
look at the facility making sure they're
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
on wellwater they're not taking in you
 
00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
know possible water from you know the
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
Mississippi River or something where
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to have issues with invasive
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
species also two with that in five FIS
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
50207 specifically states that whatever
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
state these fish are coming from has to
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
have invasive species monitoring program
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
which is something I go over right there
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're not looking at
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
this this Huck area where these Bait
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
fish might come from it's infested with
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
you know Asian carp or something because
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
we don't want that possible introduction
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
so from there if you get through all
 
00:41:39.069 --> 00:41:39.079 align:start position:0%
those testing and my requirements too
 
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
that's when we allow the importation to
 
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
occur and the importation has to be
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
delivered directly to the
 
00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
source follow up Mr chairman follow up
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
can you tell us the native bait how you
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
regul it native bait we only allow
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
golden shiners to be imported those are
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
mainly come from Arkansas aphis does the
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
testing on them smelt from
 
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
Maine and because main has very similar
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
species as us and that's it we don't
 
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
allow Fathead minnows or any other
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
invasive species to come in so on the
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
reporting form you have to specify
 
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
exactly which species of fish is coming
 
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
in represented
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
Harvey thank you uh Mr chair um so I
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
heard the sponsor of the bill I'm I'm
 
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
just confused because I heard the
 
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill testify that we are
 
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:37.720 align:start position:0%
at the mercy of outof State Testing but
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
yet I'm hearing that you are pre um
 
00:42:44.549 --> 00:42:44.559 align:start position:0%
presenting a lot of testing so um can
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
you address that I think you're talking
 
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
about the authority to import the ba the
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
testing is done call it from Arkansas

standard across the United States sorry
 
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
that's what I was asking that's
 
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire Northeast follow
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
up thank you um and just real quick you
 
00:43:33.069 --> 00:43:33.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned 150 licenses are those
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
licenses for just bait um people who
 
00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
Harvest bait those are 150,000 licensed
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
Anglers so those are the Anglers that
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
are using the bait that makes more
 
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
sense it's yeah you got 150,000 right
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
okay any further
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%

to um State my strong support for this
 
00:44:42.549 --> 00:44:42.559 align:start position:0%
bill um we know that the use of uh live
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
bait fish is a major invasive species
 
00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
and pathogen concern um the United
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
States States Geological Survey a
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
governmental institution the most
 
00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
reliable source when it comes to
 
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
invasive species tracking um they state
 
00:44:58.549 --> 00:44:58.559 align:start position:0%
that 10% of um aquatic invasive species
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
in the state um is attributed to the use
 
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:03.640 align:start position:0%
of live bait fish um they also state
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
that at least 10 aquatic species has
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
been introduced into New Hampshire
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
because of the use of live bait fish um
 
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
these numbers they align very well with
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
existing uh numbers in the literature um
 
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
there's several studies on this um one
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
study I can point out is from
 
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
2024 um it was a group they um they
 
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
looked at states that share suppliers
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire and they found that
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
10% of the bait shops they contain um
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
Bait fish that have DNA from invasive
 
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
species one uh important thing to note
 
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
is also that this bill is not just to
 
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
protect from invasive species
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
introduction but it's also to protect
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
from new diseases entering New Hampshire
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
but also microscopic organisms this
 
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
could be mil foil but it could also be
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
um microscopic Seer muscle
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
um are spying water fle in the water
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
that the fish are transported in um just
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
a few notes uh on the current testing
 
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
that is occurring in all states in in
 
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
Arkansas um I guess it should be noted
 
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
that they are currently only testing for
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
five different diseases um this bill is
 
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
very much about taking a proactive
 
00:46:18.549 --> 00:46:18.559 align:start position:0%
approach and about making sure that the
 
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
diseases we don't know about is not
 
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
going to enter New Hampshire um and
 
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
affect local ecosystems um also the
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
testing doesn't really
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
take into account invasive species um
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
there's this interesting thing happening
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
with Bait fish where they are often
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
founded in Arkansas and then transported
 
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
across the country and um it can
 
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
actually be very difficult to know the
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
flow of bait fish where the beat fish
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
are actually coming from it can be very
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
difficult to track um regarding the
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
testing I also just want to say there
 
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
are several studies out there despite
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
the testing showing that invasive
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
species and pathogens are present in the
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
bait fish supply
 
00:46:59.710 --> 00:46:59.720 align:start position:0%
um one thing I can point that is the
 
00:47:02.109 --> 00:47:02.119 align:start position:0%
natural resource department in Minnesota
 
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
in 2018 they published a report and
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
stating that they were going to ban the
 
00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
import of live bait fish from Arkansas
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
particularly golden shiners which are
 
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
often used in New Hampshire um because
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
they could not be considered invasive
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
species free or pathogen
 
00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
free right now we know that New
 
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is importing Bait fish from
 
00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
Arkansas from Main Vermont and
 
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um one of the problems
 
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
with this is that these are very small
 
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
fish um so even if you're an experienced
 
00:47:34.589 --> 00:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
angler or maybe you're a bait shop owner
 
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
they can be very very difficult to
 
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
identify by eye um another problem is
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
that some Anglers unfortunately will
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
release uh the the remaining live bait
 
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
fish they are not using by the end of
 
00:47:49.549 --> 00:47:49.559 align:start position:0%
the fishing trip directly into local
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
ecosystems um ex accelerating this
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
problem um we recently conducted a
 
00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
survey of 250 or Anglers here in New
 
00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:00.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we found that 35% of
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
Anglers they release a live bait fish in
 
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
the end of their fishing trip this
 
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
number is very similar to what is found
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
in in in in studies across the the the
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
country um when these inter invations
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
occur they can't really be undone
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
invasive species management and pathogen
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
man management is extremely difficult um
 
00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
it can not only devastate local
 
00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
ecosystems it's also incredibly
 
00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
expensive iive we know that on an
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
average ACC quaring invasive species in
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
the US they cost um on an average 7.4
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
million to manage it's very expensive
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
taking a proactive approach it's much
 
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
more cost effective um yeah we know that
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
all the states have already imple
 
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
implemented import bands to protect
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
their Fisheries this is true for
 
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
Minnesota Maine and Montana we know
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
there is a range of um of States taking
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
even stricter uh measures in in place
 
00:48:59.470 --> 00:48:59.480 align:start position:0%
are implementing stricter policies
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
that's what um compared to what is
 
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
suggested here so that would be true for
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
Oregon Washington Idaho Utah Alaska most
 
00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:10.839 align:start position:0%
Canadian provinces including Quebec um
 
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
one thing that's important to emphasize
 
00:49:14.789 --> 00:49:14.799 align:start position:0%
about this bill is um Anglers would
 
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
still be able to use live bait fish it
 
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
just needs to be sourced from within the
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
state um the survey recently conducted
 
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
of 250 angl in New Hampshire found that
 
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
7 % of Anglers they support an import
 
00:49:31.549 --> 00:49:31.559 align:start position:0%
ban on live bait fish because Anglers
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
don't want invasive species of pathogen
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
in their Waters either um this bill
 
00:49:39.069 --> 00:49:39.079 align:start position:0%
could really address a root course of a
 
00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:41.799 align:start position:0%
major invasive species pathway um it
 
00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
could help protect New Hampshire's
 
00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
natural resources for future Generations
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
um thank you so much for letting me
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
speak and I'm happy to take any
 
00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
questions of
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
course thank you representative Harvey
 
00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:49:59.309 --> 00:49:59.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question so these states um
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
that you've mentioned that either have a
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
band similar to this or even stricter
 
00:50:05.789 --> 00:50:05.799 align:start position:0%
than us they must have the same supply
 
00:50:09.309 --> 00:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
and demand problems that uh previous
 
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:13.480 align:start position:0%
testimony have has has indicated would
 
00:50:17.069 --> 00:50:17.079 align:start position:0%
um happen if we uh pass this bill so do
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
you know how those states are managing
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
their supply and demand um
 
00:50:27.789 --> 00:50:27.799 align:start position:0%
issues when because they
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
in spite of the fact that they passed
 
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
such a uh prohibition on importing fish
 
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
yeah um to my knowledge neither
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
Minnesota Maine or Montana has
 
00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
experienced this Supply demand problem
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
um er yeah I think they haven't
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
experienced it we have interviewed a
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
range of natural resource departments
 
00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:49.720 align:start position:0%
across the country um and this in
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
general hasn't come up as an issue um
 
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess one thing to mention is
 
00:50:56.789 --> 00:50:56.799 align:start position:0%
that um alternative bait could could
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
also be used um I think artificial bait
 
00:51:02.109 --> 00:51:02.119 align:start position:0%
a cut bait could be used also for ice
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
fishing and then I guess this is also an
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
and and you know we're talking about
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
protecting uh fisheries and recreational
 
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
fishing for future Generations um if New
 
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire waters are going to be
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
infested with a invasive species or
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
pathogens this is going to be um it
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
could be a way bigger issue that's
 
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
that's very costly um both um
 
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
ecosystems any further
 
00:51:33.549 --> 00:51:33.559 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
00:51:37.789 --> 00:51:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:50.200 align:start position:0%
Baker uh good morning my name is Kyle
 
00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
Baker I'm here on behalf of New
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Wildlife Federation New
 
00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Wildlife Federation is a
 
00:51:58.270 --> 00:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
93-year-old nonprofit profit that uh
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan nonprofit that advocates for
 
00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
Hunting Fishing trapping and access to
 
00:52:04.349 --> 00:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
lands to hunt fish and trap on um we're
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
here to oppose this piece of legislation
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
um I won't repeat every most everything
 
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
that I want to say has already been said
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
but we
 
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
have a lot of concern around what this
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
might happen particularly around ice
 
00:52:17.549 --> 00:52:17.559 align:start position:0%
fishing in New Hampshire um we think the
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
process that's in place through fishing
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
game provides adequate protection to the
 
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
Fisheries here in New Hampshire um we
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
also see this as um some concerns around
 
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
picking and choosing Ching which
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
habitats we're seeking to add these
 
00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
extra restrictions on Bill does not does
 
00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
not um place any sort of restrictions on
 
00:52:35.309 --> 00:52:35.319 align:start position:0%
what we would use in salt water or
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
Coastal Waters um in New Hampshire um
 
00:52:39.309 --> 00:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
but just simply targets the the Inland
 
00:52:41.549 --> 00:52:41.559 align:start position:0%
Waters and the Inland Fisheries so um we
 
00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
have a number of concerns um but I don't
 
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
want to repeat everything that's already
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
been said so but happy to answer any
 
00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
questions that someone might have thank

noot thank you um name is Alan new I've
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
been uh AJ's ba and tackle for 40 years
 
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
been in the business 45 years in the
 
00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
retail business we've been
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
purchasing import bait over that many
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
years and haven't seen an issue with our
 
00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
bait with the current laws that fishing
 
00:53:39.789 --> 00:53:39.799 align:start position:0%
game has um they brought up the um
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
States the other states that are
 
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
involved in this that have gone to this
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
band well those states are much larger
 
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
than our state they have many more
 
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
Waters to trap our state is very minimal
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
like they said it's going to decimate
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
our Waters um for Bait fish you go to
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
Maine how many lakes and ponds do they
 
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
have versus US Minnesota or Idaho all
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
the other states they named are much
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
larger than we are um we rely on this
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
importation in order to survive uh with
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
the economy we have also this is a
 
00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
global issue or a within the United
 
00:54:21.069 --> 00:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
States issue what are we going to go to
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
next I mean you're going to ban all the
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
boats coming into the state um Maine has
 
00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
a uh uh actually like the Massachusetts
 
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
has a tag that you have to clean your
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
boats coming into this state or into
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
their Waters into the Massachusetts
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
Reservoir there um we're going to go to
 
00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
stuff like that um how far is this going
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
to go is is the question I have I mean
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know now you're picking on this but
 
00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:51.799 align:start position:0%
there's more involved than just this
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
there's boats that keep coming from out
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
of state there's there's people that
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
keep coming from out of state you know
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
that are carrying bait who like they
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
said the illegal bait that gets you know
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
comes in from Massachusetts or I know
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
for a fact that some guys took some bait
 
00:55:10.589 --> 00:55:10.599 align:start position:0%
from our state that was natively
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
trapped and took it to another state
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
that didn't allow it and that happened
 
00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
this past Derby I know exactly you know
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
that stuff is happening that's going on
 
00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
so that's just going to reverse and come
 
00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:24.559 align:start position:0%
into our state some IL legal bait's
 
00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:26.559 align:start position:0%
going to come into our state because of
 
00:55:29.029 --> 00:55:29.039 align:start position:0%
the loss and you'll you'll see that
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
happen um everything else has been
 
00:55:34.109 --> 00:55:34.119 align:start position:0%
pretty much said you know the economy
 
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
you know it will devastate our business
 
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
um not allowing that to happen
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
um and one last thing that I did is we
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
petition which I
 
00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
have uh 1,75 signatures if you want to
 
00:55:59.950 --> 00:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
pass that up uh we'll are there multiple
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
copies or is that all one that's all I
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
okay we'll just give that to the clerk
 
00:56:07.029 --> 00:56:07.039 align:start position:0%
here thank you and there was also 5,000
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
reviews on that as
 
00:56:11.549 --> 00:56:11.559 align:start position:0%
well so you know people that were
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
interested in it um so on and so forth
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none uh thank you for
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you is there anyone
 
00:56:28.029 --> 00:56:28.039 align:start position:0%
who wanted to speak who's not had a
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
chance to speak yet if so you need to
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
fill out a card and pass it
 
00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
Forward not seeing anyone I will close
 
00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
FN committee we have a half an hour well
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
35 minutes before the next bill is to uh
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
is it wait a minute yeah 12:30
 
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm suggesting maybe we go ahead
 
00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
and EXA this uh after a break we want to
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
take a break and uh we can probably take
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
a 15minute break and still be able to
 
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
exact bill before we have to start at
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.789 --> 00:57:17.799 align:start position:0%
bill if everybody comes back at like uh
 
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
10 after we'll uh we'll do some more
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%

I'm what the one that asks the most
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
questions I think at at our hearings and
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
I still never get all of my answers but
 
01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
we did have a 10 or 15 minute break and
 
01:14:59.310 --> 01:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
I was able to talk with the Inland
 
01:15:02.910 --> 01:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
Fisheries and um so forth and had more
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
of my questions answered it seems that
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
um the only states that um the fish are
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
imported from our Arkansas Vermont Maine
 
01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
and one more
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you and
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
um the these have been um tested and
 
01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
regulated and so forth Vermont's fish
 
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
would be the same as our fish um
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
so I am going to vote to support the itl
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
um that although I wonder if in the
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
future if there's some way that um we
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
might look at a a new industry that
 
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
supplies bait fishing rather it's
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
through fishing game or individual
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%

consent do we have to do something with
 
01:17:38.669 --> 01:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
the am the amendment or were we no we
 
01:17:40.229 --> 01:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
had to have a positive disposition in
 
01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
order to even introduce the amendment so
 
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
it would have had to be a motion of OTP
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
before we could even amend add the
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
amendment you're correct thank you is
 
01:17:50.430 --> 01:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
there are there any objections to
 
01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
consent seeing none it'll go on consent
 
01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
I will remind uh representative Murphy
 
01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
disposition and we still have
 
01:18:13.709 --> 01:18:13.719 align:start position:0%
uh 13 minutes before we can start the
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
next bill uh it's good time to discuss
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
the fact that um I kind of didn't leave
 
01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
us a lot of time for lunch in the
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
schedule uh my mistake I'm sorry about
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
that um just realized it as I was
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
looking things over uh I meant to leave
 
01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:30.229 align:start position:0%
looking things over uh I meant to leave
more

01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
time so since we can't start a bill
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
early but we can start a bill late I'm
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
inclined to um whenever we finish this
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
next bill that starts at 12:30 give us
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh a 45 minute lunch and if we come back
 
01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
a little after 1:15 we'll still be
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
starting that bill as soon as we come
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
back if there's no objections to that so
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
that everybody has enough time for lunch
 
01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
you not yet we have one bill that starts
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
at 12:30 as soon as that one's over then
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
we'll go to lunch break for
 
01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
45 I
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
know everybody is and I and I realized I
 
01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
I wasn't leaving up a lot of time so I
 
01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:20.120 align:start position:0%

Derry there we

go um I'm here to introduce House Bill
 
01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
573 and uh it's for uh fishing game
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
search and rescue funding uh I know uh
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
in the past uh fishing game has said
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
that they had sufficient funds but uh
 
01:34:50.350 --> 01:34:50.360 align:start position:0%
you know this is a an Ever growing sport
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know uh it's it's probably the
 
01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
most the fastest growing in the State uh
 
01:34:58.629 --> 01:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
you know hiking and and a little bit of
 
01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
mountain climbing and stuff and uh
 
01:35:03.550 --> 01:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
people get in trouble uh also what uh
 
01:35:05.229 --> 01:35:05.239 align:start position:0%
what hasn't been taken into account is
 
01:35:07.390 --> 01:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
uh they they get a lot of federal money
 
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
from uh you know fishing game does and
 
01:35:12.669 --> 01:35:12.679 align:start position:0%
uh that can be shut off at any time in
 
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
fact uh you know the the Trump
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
Administration has said we're going to
 
01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to see some cutbacks and uh
 
01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
you know that there is going to be some
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
pain but let's not let it happen here in
 
01:35:24.270 --> 01:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you know the uh the
 
01:35:27.149 --> 01:35:27.159 align:start position:0%
revenue that comes from from hikers is
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
is I imagine as substantial as hunting
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
and fishing and uh you know we don't
 
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
want to lose the uh the the hotel and
 
01:35:37.790 --> 01:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
meals and room tax revenue and uh that
 
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff but uh anyway uh it's it's
 
01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:41.950 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff but uh anyway uh it's it's
for

01:35:41.950 --> 01:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
$200,000 and uh to go into the general
 
01:35:46.669 --> 01:35:46.679 align:start position:0%
fund and uh as you can read anybody that
 
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
has it in front of them the the you know
 
01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
fishing game is going to have to uh make
 
01:35:52.750 --> 01:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
a do a report to uh the finance
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
committee and this committee uh um you
 
01:35:56.229 --> 01:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
know on a quarterly basis on what
 
01:35:57.990 --> 01:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
they're doing with the money so it isn't
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
going to be squandered and um you know
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
it's it' be a safety net is what it'll
 
01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
be um I I think we need it if the
 
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
federal government ever shuts us off
 
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
from from using uh the the the Blackhawk
 
01:36:12.189 --> 01:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
helicopters from uh from the National
 
01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
Guard uh a lot of people might die you
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
know a few people might anyway and now
 
01:36:20.590 --> 01:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
one's way too many uh this also uh
 
01:36:22.590 --> 01:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
allows the the fishing game commissioner
 
01:36:26.669 --> 01:36:26.679 align:start position:0%
to uh to uh do some uh point of sale uh
 
01:36:30.109 --> 01:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
donations uh meaning they can go into uh
 
01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
you know a sporting goods store somebody
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
will go into a sporting good store and
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
and buy a new pair of hiking boots or
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
whatever and um you know they just uh
 
01:36:39.390 --> 01:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
ask them if they want to donate you know
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
a couple bucks or five bucks to to
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
fishing game search and rescue and uh
 
01:36:45.790 --> 01:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
you know as the laws are now we they
 
01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
have to have the permission to do it and
 
01:36:52.229 --> 01:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
it well thank thank you any questions
 
01:36:55.199 --> 01:36:57.030 align:start position:0%
it well thank thank you any questions
representative

01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
Harvey um so I understand you're you're
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
expecting to take $200,000 from the
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
general fund to go to search and rescue
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
correct M okay I guess followup followup
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
okay what if what if they don't use
 
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
$200,000 what happens to that money well
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
because they have to report uh how they
 
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
use it I imagine it'll just sit there or
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
go back to the general funds if they
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
don't use it if it's not needed um
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
you know they're certainly not going to
 
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
get another 200,000 next year if they
 
01:37:29.629 --> 01:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
still have 198 left if they don't use
 
01:37:32.189 --> 01:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
any but it's what it'll be is a safety
 
01:37:36.270 --> 01:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
net um it's um I'd rather have a safety
 
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
net and not need it than need it and not
 
01:37:40.030 --> 01:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
have it and
 
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
um you know like I said with the with
 
01:37:45.310 --> 01:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
the federal cutback the looming Federal
 
01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:47.310 align:start position:0%

I'm represent representative Tony
 
01:39:31.709 --> 01:39:31.719 align:start position:0%
Weinstein from New Market and I'm before
 
01:39:33.870 --> 01:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
you today because I'm a
 
01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
hiker I had hiked off and on with my
 
01:39:39.229 --> 01:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
husband when we first met he planned
 
01:39:41.550 --> 01:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
everything he would plan the hikes plan
 
01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
our routs and he dealt with all of our
 
01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
gear I went along but if I'm being
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
honest I never really enjoyed it then we
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
started visiting the White Mountains
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
with our sons and I started to more
 
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
frequently now part of the problem may
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
have been that my pace is best suited
 
01:40:00.669 --> 01:40:00.679 align:start position:0%
for that of a four-year-old um but I
 
01:40:02.750 --> 01:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
found my stride and I learned to not
 
01:40:06.510 --> 01:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
just enjoy hiking but to really love
 
01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
it I started hiking with friends we
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
hiked chakura and
 
01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
Gunstock and some other mountains and
 
01:40:15.070 --> 01:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
then decided to start tackling some of
 
01:40:18.510 --> 01:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
the 4,000 Footers we hiked
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
Washington uh because you know go Bigg
 
01:40:23.589 --> 01:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
or go home um and then we did the Fran I
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
Ridge and we hiked Mount Pierce and
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
others I never thought I could actually
 
01:40:32.350 --> 01:40:32.360 align:start position:0%
um complete the list the thought of 18
 
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
Mile days seemed impossible um but I did
 
01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
eventually finish summitting North Twin
 
01:40:40.189 --> 01:40:40.199 align:start position:0%
on a beautiful summer
 
01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
day I'm not telling you this to boast
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
but to explain that I'm a fairly
 
01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.350 align:start position:0%
but to explain that I'm a fairly
experienced

01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
hiker I carry the T Essentials I
 
01:40:54.189 --> 01:40:54.199 align:start position:0%
purchase my hike safe card
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
I check and double check and triple
 
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
check the weather
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
forecast but still accidents can happen
 
01:41:03.709 --> 01:41:03.719 align:start position:0%
I was working on another list the 52
 
01:41:06.270 --> 01:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
with a view and was hiking the mo
 
01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
Mountain Traverse with a friend it's
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
about a 10m hike it was a picture
 
01:41:14.030 --> 01:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
perfect day and we had hiked about 8
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
Miles um that afternoon when I
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
fell excuse me I heard the snap
 
01:41:26.189 --> 01:41:26.199 align:start position:0%
I tried to get up I tried to scoot down
 
01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.159 align:start position:0%
on my butt I said that I'd be damned to
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
have to call S um but as much as I
 
01:41:33.870 --> 01:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
didn't want to we quickly realized that
 
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
we would need to call for
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
help um fishing game showed up assessed
 
01:41:41.629 --> 01:41:41.639 align:start position:0%
the situation and started helping me
 
01:41:43.629 --> 01:41:43.639 align:start position:0%
down the mountain to a waiting litter
 
01:41:45.709 --> 01:41:45.719 align:start position:0%
where I was then transported by a group
 
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
of volunteers who took turns carrying me
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
down the
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
mountain I was prepared but I still
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
broke my ankle that that
 
01:41:57.589 --> 01:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
day I can't imagine what would have
 
01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
happened if I called and there is no one
 
01:42:01.149 --> 01:42:01.159 align:start position:0%
there to
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
help so I'm here today to ask you to
 
01:42:06.629 --> 01:42:06.639 align:start position:0%
support this bill and provide funding to
 
01:42:08.669 --> 01:42:08.679 align:start position:0%
allow the men and women of fishing game
 
01:42:12.109 --> 01:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
to be equipped to do their jobs thank
 
01:42:15.149 --> 01:42:15.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you are there any
 
01:42:21.629 --> 01:42:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:24.109 --> 01:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
testimony the chair calls Colonel Kevin
 
01:42:30.270 --> 01:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:32.430 --> 01:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
game morning Mr chairman and members of
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
Kevin Jordan and I'm the colonel at New
 
01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game and I just want
 
01:42:39.790 --> 01:42:39.800 align:start position:0%
to tell you if we don't have any money
 
01:42:41.629 --> 01:42:41.639 align:start position:0%
we will be coming to get you if you ever
 
01:42:44.189 --> 01:42:44.199 align:start position:0%
need it so and you could tell my Colonel
 
01:42:44.199 --> 01:42:45.189 align:start position:0%
need it so and you could tell my Colonel
said

01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:42:49.189 --> 01:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
that um so we don't ever want to say no
 
01:42:50.709 --> 01:42:50.719 align:start position:0%
to someone that's trying to help us and
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate representative
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
lovees concerned for this he's done it
 
01:42:56.589 --> 01:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
uh I think this is the second or third
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
time he's tried to do this um he does
 
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
make a valid point about the about we do
 
01:43:05.070 --> 01:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
use the helicopter in life and death um
 
01:43:07.629 --> 01:43:07.639 align:start position:0%
and we've been very fortunate uh that
 
01:43:09.390 --> 01:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
the the United States government has
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
allowed us to do that because there's
 
01:43:13.870 --> 01:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
laws that say you can't use a federal
 
01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
asset for a state uh without payment and
 
01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
so they've written it off as training in
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
most cases and I I have testified to
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
this a couple of times but because of
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
their their work with us uh I'm being
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
told they're some of the best pilots in
 
01:43:30.669 --> 01:43:30.679 align:start position:0%
the in the country so that when they go
 
01:43:32.109 --> 01:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
to Afghanistan they're very good at
 
01:43:33.709 --> 01:43:33.719 align:start position:0%
flying in the mountains because they do
 
01:43:35.229 --> 01:43:35.239 align:start position:0%
it here in the White Mountains so we all
 
01:43:37.709 --> 01:43:37.719 align:start position:0%
benefit from that but if we were ever
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
having if we ever had to pay for that
 
01:43:41.589 --> 01:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
helicopter that resource would be gone
 
01:43:43.629 --> 01:43:43.639 align:start position:0%
because we can't pay for it one mission
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
is is I get bills from them when they do
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
a mission so I know what it cost uh and
 
01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:51.320 align:start position:0%
then they submit a waiver to get the
 
01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
bill um forgiven and I've seen bills 80
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
$90,000 for a single flight to get
 
01:43:59.310 --> 01:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
people but I'm here to tell you if we
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
don't have it people will die the only
 
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
time I use it is when people are near
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
death uh and they literally have plucked
 
01:44:09.390 --> 01:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
people from Death uh at 82 degrees core
 
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
temperature and got them to a hospital
 
01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
and if we carried them down and bounced
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
them down the trail we would certainly
 
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
kill them doing that so so it is a
 
01:44:18.669 --> 01:44:18.679 align:start position:0%
valuable resource it's one I'm concerned
 
01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
about if we lose um so I told represent
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
of love I would support it right now I'm
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
I'm really happy and excited to say that
 
01:44:30.750 --> 01:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
we're making ends meet with what we have
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
so just so you know representative Khan
 
01:44:35.629 --> 01:44:35.639 align:start position:0%
we for since the 80s Senator blazel put
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
in a l in the 80s that allowed us to
 
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
take a dollar from every uh OHV every
 
01:44:45.870 --> 01:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
ATV every um boat hunting license or a
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
fishing license and put it into a search
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
and rescue account and that is at that's
 
01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
never changed from the 80s uh even
 
01:44:54.910 --> 01:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
though inflation really has changed um
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
so that gives us
 
01:44:58.669 --> 01:44:58.679 align:start position:0%
$180,000 roughly each year for search
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
and rescue I'm spending three to 400,000
 
01:45:04.149 --> 01:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
depending on the year we do a couple
 
01:45:06.669 --> 01:45:06.679 align:start position:0%
hundred missions a year uh the cost
 
01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
varies but it averages out to about 180
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
missions each year and we're spending
 
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
this past year I spent
 
01:45:16.030 --> 01:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
$400,000 uh for that so the hike safe
 
01:45:18.830 --> 01:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
card picks up a lot of that slack last
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
year it brought us in
 
01:45:23.870 --> 01:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
$363,000 in Revenue so it's it's been
 
01:45:26.350 --> 01:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
really a good program um and it's helped
 
01:45:29.910 --> 01:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
us a lot so right now we're good I mean
 
01:45:32.189 --> 01:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
I can always use more because we're in a
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
position where where more is always
 
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
better but we're in a better place today
 
01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
than we were 10 years ago when I started
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
coming over here so um but I don't I
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to ever say no to help so
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
that's basically where I'm at with
 
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
that thank you questions representative
 
01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:51.430 align:start position:0%
that thank you questions representative
Harvey

01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
Harvey
 
01:45:54.589 --> 01:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
so I I'm conf fused so we would
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate $200,000 from general fund
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
to search and rescue uh okay but you
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
might not need it because you're making
 
01:46:06.270 --> 01:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
ends meet right so where does that money
 
01:46:07.870 --> 01:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
so search the search and rescue account
 
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
is a non-aps account so money that's in
 
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
there that we don't use uh would carry
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
over for the next uh budget year so it
 
01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go away it would be and we
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
file reports now with Finance we're
 
01:46:22.589 --> 01:46:22.599 align:start position:0%
required annually to file a report every
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
year with with what we spend um and how
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
much is in with the balance in the
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
account so that would be monitored uh
 
01:46:30.669 --> 01:46:30.679 align:start position:0%
and my expectation would be if we don't
 
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
use it we wouldn't get
 
01:46:37.950 --> 01:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
it followup please followup so okay so I
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
think you would use the 200,000 but I'm
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
just play I can assure you I would right
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm just but I don't want to say I I
 
01:46:45.589 --> 01:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
think it's important where you're taking
 
01:46:47.589 --> 01:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
a vote I don't want you to think that I
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
that we have to use it if we had it I
 
01:46:50.790 --> 01:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
would use it to buy equipment I would
 
01:46:52.109 --> 01:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
use it to buy Cruisers and other
 
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
equipment we haven't bought for search
 
01:46:55.629 --> 01:46:55.639 align:start position:0%
and rescue for a long time so my
 
01:46:56.830 --> 01:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
question is kind of like a devil's
 
01:46:58.629 --> 01:46:58.639 align:start position:0%
advocate question okay so if you don't
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh with the state has worked that way so
 
01:47:29.470 --> 01:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
um so I wouldn't expect that and we
 
01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you know we wouldn't you
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just spend it on anything I
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
mean there's a lot of things that we
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
used to buy in search and rescue we used
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
to buy cruisers for the for the advance
 
01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
search and rescue team that uses the
 
01:47:41.870 --> 01:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
Cruisers more for search and rescue than
 
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
anything else we haven't been able to do
 
01:47:46.189 --> 01:47:46.199 align:start position:0%
that for years um so that money I would
 
01:47:47.550 --> 01:47:47.560 align:start position:0%
use for those types of things it
 
01:47:50.109 --> 01:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a waste but it but we're not
 
01:47:52.350 --> 01:47:52.360 align:start position:0%
desperate for it I guess is what I'd ask
 
01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
you to think of
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
about representative
 
01:47:59.350 --> 01:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
ulette uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question yes sir just
 
01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
to to clarify make sure I understood
 
01:48:05.790 --> 01:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
what you're saying so uh in this past
 
01:48:08.669 --> 01:48:08.679 align:start position:0%
year you spent about 360,000 yes in
 
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
rescues the uh hike safe card brought in
 
01:48:15.709 --> 01:48:15.719 align:start position:0%
about 350,000 yes sir and with the other
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
dollar from the registration from the
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles the atbs fishermen so you
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
had about 160,000 140,000 uh
 
01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh excess funds the year that went into
 
01:48:27.470 --> 01:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
your your account correct that we used
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
yes yes okay thank you yes
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
sir representative tutor thank you Mr
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question yes
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
sir um I'm just wondering uh this
 
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
obviously you know it's going to be a
 
01:48:41.470 --> 01:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
really tough budget year and yes and
 
01:48:44.270 --> 01:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
selling Finance on $200,000 might be a
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
tough sell yes I'm wondering if we were
 
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
to think about maybe changing the the
 
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
fee from a dollar to $2 maybe you know
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
in next in the next session if that
 
01:48:56.189 --> 01:48:56.199 align:start position:0%
might be a better approach to get you
 
01:48:58.910 --> 01:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
the same kind of money long overdue
 
01:49:01.629 --> 01:49:01.639 align:start position:0%
frankly um I don't know those
 
01:49:04.189 --> 01:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
communities might come out you know
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
those those folks that ride ATVs and buy
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
hunting license and boating uh might
 
01:49:10.990 --> 01:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
come out against it because they feel
 
01:49:13.149 --> 01:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
like they're paying the Lion Share now
 
01:49:15.790 --> 01:49:15.800 align:start position:0%
and I can and the statistics show that
 
01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
we're not they're not receiving the The
 
01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
Lion Share the services the hikers are
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
but those are those are also Solutions
 
01:49:27.589 --> 01:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh to that and and you know anything
 
01:49:29.310 --> 01:49:29.320 align:start position:0%
that you decide to do I would agree it's
 
01:49:31.790 --> 01:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
going to be a tight budget year um and
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
it and I think it would be a hard
 
01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
sell representative Harvey so to piggy
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
back on his question um um that it is a
 
01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
tight budget year and and and if we keep
 
01:49:47.310 --> 01:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
acre this 200,000 that's a lot of money
 
01:49:50.189 --> 01:49:50.199 align:start position:0%
um why don't you raise the he hike safe
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
card as well um who who has the
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
authority to do that we do and so I'm
 
01:49:58.669 --> 01:49:58.679 align:start position:0%
I'm careful with hik safe and I'll tell
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
you why each year it has since 2015 it's
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
gotten better it's improved every year
 
01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
and so my feeling was and this is
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
strictly my opinion is when we hit a
 
01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
plateau when we get to a point where
 
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
we're not gaining anything or in fact
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
starting to lose then I would then I
 
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
would choose to go in and try to change
 
01:50:20.189 --> 01:50:20.199 align:start position:0%
something I'm a little leery of because
 
01:50:22.910 --> 01:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
remember it's voluntary so I'm a little
 
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
of scaring people away uh and it if it's
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
working well I'm a firm believer and let
 
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
it work well and stay out of it so I
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
haven't done that as yet it's been
 
01:50:34.070 --> 01:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
suggested a lot and and it's certainly
 
01:50:35.589 --> 01:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
something I would we're going to
 
01:50:37.870 --> 01:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
consider but each year it seems to climb
 
01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
and I and when it's climbing and I look
 
01:50:41.629 --> 01:50:41.639 align:start position:0%
at that figure I think well we're doing
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
pretty well I don't know that I want to
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
rock that boat just yet um it's been a
 
01:50:48.589 --> 01:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
long time coming and and it's valuable
 
01:50:51.629 --> 01:50:51.639 align:start position:0%
to us and and I you know it doesn't seem
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
to hurt the hikers
 
01:50:54.990 --> 01:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
who are paying for them that are buying
 
01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
these cards they seem good doing it so I
 
01:50:59.310 --> 01:50:59.320 align:start position:0%
haven't raised it but we can we do have
 
01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
the authority to raise that
 
01:51:05.709 --> 01:51:05.719 align:start position:0%
Fe any further questions representative
 
01:51:08.669 --> 01:51:08.679 align:start position:0%
Khan thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
cor Jordan for taking my question coron
 
01:51:13.229 --> 01:51:13.239 align:start position:0%
Jordan in my time in this committee many
 
01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
many times you told us that how much
 
01:51:19.790 --> 01:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
rescue you did some of them are good U
 
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
you know good stories some of them are
 
01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
sad stories
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh can you tell us that how much uh you
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
money you get back from those families
 
01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
and organizations that they you do
 
01:51:35.069 --> 01:51:35.079 align:start position:0%
rescue and you have just say $50,000
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
cost but do you get any reimburse from
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
those uh people so we do we get two ways
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
that we get it so people are uh Believe
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
It or Not people make donations uh which
 
01:51:48.750 --> 01:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
is very nice they'll uh people that
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
we've rescued have been uh we've reached
 
01:51:53.550 --> 01:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
out to them on occasion uh for the
 
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
outdoor Council the volunteer groups
 
01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
that help us that don't receive any
 
01:51:58.390 --> 01:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
funding we've reached out and asked for
 
01:51:59.950 --> 01:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
donations to go to them and people are
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
good about that so about every month I'm
 
01:52:04.589 --> 01:52:04.599 align:start position:0%
bringing small donations before my
 
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
commission to get approval to use that
 
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
goes into the search and rescue account
 
01:52:12.270 --> 01:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
and then we build for some rescues we do
 
01:52:14.350 --> 01:52:14.360 align:start position:0%
have the ability the legislature gave us
 
01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
the ability uh a number of years ago to
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
Bill irresponsible hikers we don't do
 
01:52:22.510 --> 01:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
that a lot um it has to be pretty
 
01:52:25.149 --> 01:52:25.159 align:start position:0%
outrageous behavior before I'll do it so
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
out of 180 missions we build 10 to 12 of
 
01:52:31.149 --> 01:52:31.159 align:start position:0%
those folks every year uh and we enjoy
 
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
about a 61 or 62% collection rate so we
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
collect probably a little over half of
 
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
what we bill um the problem comes in
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
that some of those missions run 50 and
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
$60,000 so that's a that's a hard pill
 
01:52:48.790 --> 01:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
for people to pay back uh we negotiate
 
01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
payment schedules we we negotiate the
 
01:52:53.790 --> 01:52:53.800 align:start position:0%
amount some times I settle for a much
 
01:52:55.589 --> 01:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
lesser amount for people that have no
 
01:52:58.470 --> 01:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
ability to pay so we we do generate some
 
01:53:00.669 --> 01:53:00.679 align:start position:0%
of that and the donations seem to
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
continue to come we got I we received a
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
donation last night for $5,000 to go
 
01:53:06.750 --> 01:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
into the search and rescue account so a
 
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
lot of people are doing that which is
 
01:53:11.069 --> 01:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
helpful that account is in better shape
 
01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
today than it's been in the 34 years
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
I've been here so I'm very happy to say
 
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm only looking for that to improve
 
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to say no to help that's
 
01:53:22.149 --> 01:53:22.159 align:start position:0%
that's my reason for being here I'll
 
01:53:24.510 --> 01:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
never say no if someone wants to help
 
01:53:26.069 --> 01:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
but we're we're doing better than we
 
01:53:27.709 --> 01:53:27.719 align:start position:0%
have in a long
 
01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:29.880 align:start position:0%

and we really see the agency's work as
 
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
so critical to us fulfilling our
 
01:54:22.669 --> 01:54:22.679 align:start position:0%
missions um that anytime we get a chance
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
to support the agency uh in seeking
 
01:54:28.830 --> 01:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
funding particularly as has been noted
 
01:54:31.229 --> 01:54:31.239 align:start position:0%
in a very challenging budget year uh we
 
01:54:34.069 --> 01:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
take the opportunity to do so I think
 
01:54:36.510 --> 01:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
you've asked some really good questions
 
01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
um that may warrant uh making some
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
changes to this legislation um I did
 
01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
want to point out that um all three
 
01:54:48.189 --> 01:54:48.199 align:start position:0%
organizations have uh participated in
 
01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:50.360 align:start position:0%
several study committees over the years
 
01:54:51.790 --> 01:54:51.800 align:start position:0%
over more than a decade there have been
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
a few study committees looking at how to
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh ensure that the agency has
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
sustainable funding um and thank you to
 
01:55:01.990 --> 01:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
the chairman for his service on the last
 
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:05.560 align:start position:0%
one which was um last summer and fall
 
01:55:08.069 --> 01:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
and during that conversation a lot of um
 
01:55:09.790 --> 01:55:09.800 align:start position:0%
I would say new stakeholders
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
participated and expressed their
 
01:55:14.709 --> 01:55:14.719 align:start position:0%
interest and support for being a part of
 
01:55:17.470 --> 01:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
uh long-term Funding Solutions and the
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
part of this bill on line 24 that allows
 
01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
the uh fishing game director to invest
 
01:55:27.870 --> 01:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
in technology to enable collection of
 
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
donations which um the prime sponsor
 
01:55:32.669 --> 01:55:32.679 align:start position:0%
referenced at point of sale we think
 
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
could be a really important tool that as
 
01:55:37.510 --> 01:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
people are buying equipment if they were
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
offered the option to you know donate a
 
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
few dollars on top of their purchase uh
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
we think that could be a really valuable
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
tool to increase um the resources that
 
01:55:51.790 --> 01:55:51.800 align:start position:0%
fishing game has to perform important
 
01:55:54.390 --> 01:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
duties like search and rescue uh and
 
01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
with that I'd be happy to answer any
 
01:55:58.950 --> 01:55:58.960 align:start position:0%

it being 1:45 the time and date certain
 
02:47:27.150 --> 02:47:27.160 align:start position:0%
when we delayed the meeting too um I am
 
02:47:29.230 --> 02:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
going to open the hearing public hearing
 
02:47:32.630 --> 02:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
on 589 FN and I recognize the prime
 
02:47:35.349 --> 02:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill uh representative
 
02:47:38.030 --> 02:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
Schultz thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:47:39.990 --> 02:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
to the committee it's an honor to be
 
02:47:41.710 --> 02:47:41.720 align:start position:0%
here I think it's my first time coming
 
02:47:44.469 --> 02:47:44.479 align:start position:0%
to fishing game uh you know I I don't
 
02:47:45.950 --> 02:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
even think I've subbed on your committee
 
02:47:47.750 --> 02:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
before so it's really an honor to be
 
02:47:50.510 --> 02:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
here I did pass passed out an amendment
 
02:47:54.190 --> 02:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
uh that I believe tremendously improves
 
02:47:55.510 --> 02:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
the bill but I'll get to that in a
 
02:47:57.150 --> 02:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
minute I wanted to take a step back
 
02:48:01.070 --> 02:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
first and say hi I represent uh about a
 
02:48:03.710 --> 02:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
third of conquered including where we
 
02:48:06.830 --> 02:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
are sitting now so you're in my district
 
02:48:10.150 --> 02:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
um and I also want to make it clear that
 
02:48:12.830 --> 02:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
for this whole topic I would not have
 
02:48:16.030 --> 02:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
taken this bill on if it didn't support
 
02:48:20.030 --> 02:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
people who fish and people who hunt I
 
02:48:22.790 --> 02:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
grew up in Kentucky where half of my
 
02:48:26.150 --> 02:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
family did fish regularly and I was in
 
02:48:28.510 --> 02:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
that part of the family more often and
 
02:48:31.230 --> 02:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
the other half uh did hunt and somehow
 
02:48:34.110 --> 02:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
my dad did both and so I grew up eating
 
02:48:37.429 --> 02:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
what I called as a little girl the
 
02:48:40.309 --> 02:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
Bambi deer squirrel rabbits that was a
 
02:48:42.349 --> 02:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
part of my upbringing so and how to look
 
02:48:45.670 --> 02:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
for buckshot so you didn't uh bite into
 
02:48:48.030 --> 02:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
it that kind of a thing so I would not
 
02:48:50.309 --> 02:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
have taken part in this bill if in any
 
02:48:52.950 --> 02:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
way it I would
 
02:48:55.510 --> 02:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
um cause a problem for hunters and
 
02:49:00.110 --> 02:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
Anglers who are uh into the conservation
 
02:49:01.990 --> 02:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know and doing these things the
 
02:49:03.910 --> 02:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
correct way it is a bipartisan bill with
 
02:49:06.670 --> 02:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
Republicans and Democrats somehow more
 
02:49:09.630 --> 02:49:09.640 align:start position:0%
state senators as co-sponsors than reps
 
02:49:12.910 --> 02:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
but anyway let me H to to the key points
 
02:49:14.750 --> 02:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
02:49:19.429 --> 02:49:19.439 align:start position:0%
um what is want want and waste so um one
 
02:49:21.790 --> 02:49:21.800 align:start position:0%
waste is a disgraceful Act of leaving a
 
02:49:24.309 --> 02:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
wounded or killed animal in the field or
 
02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
Forest without making a reasonable
 
02:49:28.670 --> 02:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
effort to retrieve it for consumption or
 
02:49:31.670 --> 02:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
use it is a senseless waste of life and
 
02:49:34.510 --> 02:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
a blatant disregard for the principles
 
02:49:37.030 --> 02:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
of responsible Wildlife
 
02:49:39.790 --> 02:49:39.800 align:start position:0%
stewardship and so what are Wildlife
 
02:49:42.469 --> 02:49:42.479 align:start position:0%
killing contests these contests are
 
02:49:44.630 --> 02:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
organized competitions in which
 
02:49:46.870 --> 02:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
participants compete for cash prizes and
 
02:49:49.229 --> 02:49:49.239 align:start position:0%
other incentives to kill his many of a
 
02:49:52.910 --> 02:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
targeted species as possible they turn
 
02:49:55.870 --> 02:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
our state's public Trust of wildlife
 
02:49:57.750 --> 02:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
into mere targets for entertainment
 
02:49:59.429 --> 02:49:59.439 align:start position:0%
rather than respecting them as part of
 
02:50:01.950 --> 02:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
our shared natural heritage and I will
 
02:50:04.910 --> 02:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
step back to say the conversations that
 
02:50:07.910 --> 02:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
I have after filing the initial bill did
 
02:50:11.309 --> 02:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
lead to the amended version that does
 
02:50:15.190 --> 02:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
recognize that for example uh we started
 
02:50:17.030 --> 02:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
the list all these exceptions that we
 
02:50:20.469 --> 02:50:20.479 align:start position:0%
wanted like you know you had a um
 
02:50:22.830 --> 02:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
fishing contest of who had the biggest
 
02:50:25.469 --> 02:50:25.479 align:start position:0%
bass and you know a fishing derby that
 
02:50:27.429 --> 02:50:27.439 align:start position:0%
would be an exception and other things
 
02:50:31.630 --> 02:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
like who caught the biggest uh or most
 
02:50:34.389 --> 02:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh turkeys in this season the way you do
 
02:50:35.910 --> 02:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
that over a season and what you're
 
02:50:38.349 --> 02:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
allowed to do or you know anyway people
 
02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
were coming up with so many exceptions
 
02:50:42.429 --> 02:50:42.439 align:start position:0%
we took a step back and decided to amend
 
02:50:45.469 --> 02:50:45.479 align:start position:0%
the bill uh approaching it in a much
 
02:50:46.910 --> 02:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
different way because we could keep
 
02:50:48.790 --> 02:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
coming up with exceptions that seemed
 
02:50:51.309 --> 02:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh till the cows come home
 
02:50:53.870 --> 02:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't sure that that was the best
 
02:50:57.710 --> 02:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
place for us as uh legislature to get to
 
02:51:00.790 --> 02:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
drill that down so deeply so the Crux of
 
02:51:05.630 --> 02:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
the amended version is essentially to uh
 
02:51:08.590 --> 02:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
allow uh for the rul making process to
 
02:51:11.150 --> 02:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
do that piece of it so the bill itself
 
02:51:14.910 --> 02:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
as a me if you decide to amend it um is
 
02:51:17.630 --> 02:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
in fact addressing these points that I'm
 
02:51:19.070 --> 02:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
going over now
 
02:51:22.349 --> 02:51:22.359 align:start position:0%
but then at the discretion of um the way
 
02:51:25.550 --> 02:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
the bill outlines it uh then leaves it
 
02:51:27.269 --> 02:51:27.279 align:start position:0%
to the rul making process with the
 
02:51:31.229 --> 02:51:31.239 align:start position:0%
director um fish and game um and we'll
 
02:51:35.389 --> 02:51:35.399 align:start position:0%
get to that um so like I said it's not a
 
02:51:37.670 --> 02:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
restrict restricting any lawful hunting
 
02:51:40.349 --> 02:51:40.359 align:start position:0%
or fishing as licensed and regulated by
 
02:51:43.710 --> 02:51:43.720 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire fishing game uh folks
 
02:51:45.910 --> 02:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
ethical Hunters follow Fair Chase
 
02:51:48.710 --> 02:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
principles and respect the animals they
 
02:51:51.830 --> 02:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
pursue this legislation simply seeks to
 
02:51:54.389 --> 02:51:54.399 align:start position:0%
end the Reckless wasteful Slaughter that
 
02:51:56.990 --> 02:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
gives real Hunters a bad name and is
 
02:51:59.110 --> 02:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
increasingly condemned by Wildlife
 
02:51:59.120 --> 02:52:00.469 align:start position:0%
increasingly condemned by Wildlife
professionals

02:52:00.469 --> 02:52:00.479 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
02:52:02.950 --> 02:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
Nationwide if the sheer immorality of
 
02:52:05.190 --> 02:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
leaving dead animals to rot or killing
 
02:52:08.030 --> 02:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
for sport prizes isn't enough to ban
 
02:52:10.389 --> 02:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
these contests consider these two major
 
02:52:13.229 --> 02:52:13.239 align:start position:0%
points the association of Fish and
 
02:52:16.389 --> 02:52:16.399 align:start position:0%
Wildlife agencies of which New Hampshire
 
02:52:18.870 --> 02:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
fishing game is a member opposes these
 
02:52:18.880 --> 02:52:20.269 align:start position:0%
fishing game is a member opposes these
unethical

02:52:20.269 --> 02:52:20.279 align:start position:0%
unethical
 
02:52:22.790 --> 02:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
practices and the North American model
 
02:52:25.309 --> 02:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
of wildlife conservation which New
 
02:52:27.269 --> 02:52:27.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game explicitly
 
02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
endorses upholds these relevant core
 
02:52:32.469 --> 02:52:32.479 align:start position:0%
principles Wildlife Resources are
 
02:52:35.229 --> 02:52:35.239 align:start position:0%
conserved and held in trust for all
 
02:52:38.269 --> 02:52:38.279 align:start position:0%
citizens and Wildlife may only be killed
 
02:52:40.790 --> 02:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
for a legitimate non-frivolous
 
02:52:43.950 --> 02:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
purpose and I'll also say a constituent
 
02:52:46.710 --> 02:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
brought this to my attention this topic
 
02:52:50.150 --> 02:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
and I've been working with Chris shadler
 
02:52:53.349 --> 02:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
and Welden Bosworth um of the New
 
02:52:55.550 --> 02:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Wildlife Commission and we
 
02:52:57.349 --> 02:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
have been collaborating with a number of
 
02:52:59.710 --> 02:52:59.720 align:start position:0%
folks and I actually would like to defer
 
02:53:02.429 --> 02:53:02.439 align:start position:0%
to them on the specc specifics of that
 
02:53:05.710 --> 02:53:05.720 align:start position:0%
and the amendment to to some degree um
 
02:53:07.550 --> 02:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
and so anyway so this bill would really
 
02:53:10.469 --> 02:53:10.479 align:start position:0%
be a necessary step to the process of
 
02:53:13.030 --> 02:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
upholding ethical hunting traditions and
 
02:53:15.229 --> 02:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
and angling traditions and ensure our
 
02:53:17.349 --> 02:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
state continues to lead in responsible
 
02:53:17.359 --> 02:53:18.990 align:start position:0%
state continues to lead in responsible
conservation

02:53:18.990 --> 02:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
um so that's my brief hopefully brief
 
02:53:22.800 --> 02:53:24.550 align:start position:0%
um so that's my brief hopefully brief
presentation

02:53:24.550 --> 02:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
02:53:27.750 --> 02:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah there we
 
02:53:30.229 --> 02:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
go thank you for your testimony are
 
02:53:31.269 --> 02:53:31.279 align:start position:0%
there any
 
02:53:34.030 --> 02:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
questions oh Mr chair I forgot about one
 
02:53:36.510 --> 02:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
thing I should take questions first
 
02:53:38.750 --> 02:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
though if you work it into a question
 
02:53:40.990 --> 02:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
great if not you can follow up with it
 
02:53:43.550 --> 02:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
02:53:45.950 --> 02:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
Harvey so
 
02:53:48.670 --> 02:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
02:53:52.590 --> 02:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
so I I'm just so the the bill is is one
 
02:53:56.870 --> 02:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
thing but are the amendment is to put
 
02:53:58.469 --> 02:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
both of these things into the rule
 
02:54:01.990 --> 02:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
making for fishing gaming okay so if we
 
02:54:04.229 --> 02:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
vote for the amendment
 
02:54:07.389 --> 02:54:07.399 align:start position:0%
then what what is in the bill is
 
02:54:09.389 --> 02:54:09.399 align:start position:0%
basically n and void right it that'ss
 
02:54:10.870 --> 02:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
the whole bill except for the enacting
 
02:54:13.070 --> 02:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
Clause okay which is the introductory
 
02:54:16.630 --> 02:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
piece okay got it thank you and it um
 
02:54:18.870 --> 02:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
really does give uh
 
02:54:21.469 --> 02:54:21.479 align:start position:0%
the executive director the authority to
 
02:54:24.590 --> 02:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
work um on these adoption of rules and
 
02:54:27.870 --> 02:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
that's where they can sus out Does it
 
02:54:29.550 --> 02:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
include this fishing derby or anything
 
02:54:32.670 --> 02:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
that has brought to their attention um
 
02:54:34.190 --> 02:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
you know the way those things are raised
 
02:54:37.030 --> 02:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
in any fashion so rulemaking process
 
02:54:39.150 --> 02:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
then takes the front stage in this bill
 
02:54:40.590 --> 02:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
and I will say there was another
 
02:54:42.830 --> 02:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
suggestion that I am open to including
 
02:54:44.670 --> 02:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
and rephrasing a little bit of the
 
02:54:47.190 --> 02:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
wording around what want and waste is to
 
02:54:50.870 --> 02:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
say uh wild animal or wild bird as a
 
02:54:54.349 --> 02:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
part of that um I'm I'm not sure why
 
02:54:56.590 --> 02:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
they aren't suggesting fish but maybe
 
02:54:59.070 --> 02:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
that is a different topic than this
 
02:55:01.510 --> 02:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
amendment must address but we can figure
 
02:55:03.830 --> 02:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
that out for sure but so and just know
 
02:55:06.110 --> 02:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
that I'm open to that
 
02:55:10.870 --> 02:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:13.030 --> 02:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:55:15.190 --> 02:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
Durkin thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:55:17.790 --> 02:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so these
 
02:55:20.429 --> 02:55:20.439 align:start position:0%
hunting comp contests can you tell me
 
02:55:22.429 --> 02:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
and be a little specific how many there
 
02:55:25.510 --> 02:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
are in the state and of what species
 
02:55:29.110 --> 02:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
they're hunting or I I'm not sure of
 
02:55:31.790 --> 02:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
that myself I think are the folks that
 
02:55:33.750 --> 02:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
have collaborated with me will know
 
02:55:36.990 --> 02:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
better um I mean in some cases we may
 
02:55:39.469 --> 02:55:39.479 align:start position:0%
not know what those are but um I will
 
02:55:42.550 --> 02:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
defer to them on that answer they're um
 
02:55:44.790 --> 02:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
much more knowledgeable about when these
 
02:55:49.590 --> 02:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:49.600 --> 02:55:50.309 align:start position:0%
 
thank

02:56:09.110 --> 02:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
Committee of the suggested additional
 
02:56:11.110 --> 02:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment did you give a copy to the

Garcia hi thank you for taking my
 
02:56:49.429 --> 02:56:49.439 align:start position:0%
testimony this is my first time
 
02:56:52.349 --> 02:56:52.359 align:start position:0%
testifying welcome I'm nervous I'm
 
02:56:55.469 --> 02:56:55.479 align:start position:0%
emotional don't be we all people well
 
02:56:58.670 --> 02:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
I'm emotional because of what's at stake
 
02:57:02.030 --> 02:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh to me uh I'm from Peterboro
 
02:57:04.910 --> 02:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
gratuitous violence and killing is not
 
02:57:07.510 --> 02:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
the sign of a healthy
 
02:57:12.030 --> 02:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
Society I value life I value
 
02:57:14.790 --> 02:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
nature I value
 
02:57:17.590 --> 02:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
creation I value the very strong family
 
02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:18.790 align:start position:0%
creation I value the very strong family
systems

02:57:18.790 --> 02:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
systems
 
02:57:22.190 --> 02:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:25.670 --> 02:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
place the balance of
 
02:57:28.429 --> 02:57:28.439 align:start position:0%
nature um the issues of the balance of
 
02:57:31.030 --> 02:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
Nature has led to negative
 
02:57:34.710 --> 02:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
repercussions when you remove the top
 
02:57:38.389 --> 02:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
predators this has been evidenced by the
 
02:57:40.269 --> 02:57:40.279 align:start position:0%
deer explosion and what do we do with
 
02:57:42.190 --> 02:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
all the deer and all the killing of deer
 
02:57:43.710 --> 02:57:43.720 align:start position:0%
that has to happen because they don't
 
02:57:45.990 --> 02:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
have a top
 
02:57:50.229 --> 02:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
predator uh people are afraid of coyotes
 
02:57:53.590 --> 02:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think they're as bad as people
 
02:57:56.990 --> 02:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
think uh people like to shoot coyotes I
 
02:57:58.469 --> 02:57:58.479 align:start position:0%
understand there is no limitation on
 
02:58:01.469 --> 02:58:01.479 align:start position:0%
shooting coyotes coyotes have a very
 
02:58:04.750 --> 02:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
strong family system they do well if
 
02:58:07.269 --> 02:58:07.279 align:start position:0%
left to their own hierarchy to keep
 
02:58:09.389 --> 02:58:09.399 align:start position:0%
their numbers
 
02:58:12.590 --> 02:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
down when you go and you kill a
 
02:58:15.429 --> 02:58:15.439 align:start position:0%
mother you're encouraging the other
 
02:58:19.190 --> 02:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
females in the pack to
 
02:58:21.990 --> 02:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
reproduce so the idea that you could
 
02:58:24.269 --> 02:58:24.279 align:start position:0%
just kill off the coyotes and that's
 
02:58:26.229 --> 02:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
going to solve the problem of people
 
02:58:28.070 --> 02:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
being afraid of coyotes is you're
 
02:58:30.870 --> 02:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
actually Fanning the flames on
 
02:58:33.830 --> 02:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
reproduction so we do need to have those
 
02:58:33.840 --> 02:58:35.550 align:start position:0%
reproduction so we do need to have those
top

02:58:35.550 --> 02:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
top
 
02:58:39.269 --> 02:58:39.279 align:start position:0%
predators uh wolves are protective
 
02:58:41.870 --> 02:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
species I would love to see wolves come
 
02:58:45.670 --> 02:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
back into our balance of nature in New
 
02:58:48.870 --> 02:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh they cannot be easily
 
02:58:50.630 --> 02:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
identified as being separate from
 
02:58:53.550 --> 02:58:53.560 align:start position:0%
coyotes I I would not be able to tell a
 
02:58:54.910 --> 02:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
wolf from a
 
02:58:57.150 --> 02:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
coyote um there's a difference in the
 
02:58:59.150 --> 02:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
eye placement a difference in the ears
 
02:59:02.309 --> 02:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
and maybe the size but really uh
 
02:59:05.630 --> 02:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
apparently people have shot wolves or or
 
02:59:07.670 --> 02:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
wolves that are
 
02:59:09.710 --> 02:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
hybrids uh because they thought they
 
02:59:09.720 --> 02:59:11.070 align:start position:0%
hybrids uh because they thought they
were

02:59:11.070 --> 02:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:59:14.150 --> 02:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
coyotes so
 
02:59:16.950 --> 02:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
um I think I've pretty much expressed
 
02:59:18.510 --> 02:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
what I was thinking I just want to add
 
02:59:21.229 --> 02:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
one more thing we have such a wonderful
 
02:59:24.590 --> 02:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
State wonderful nature wonderful
 
02:59:29.670 --> 02:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
woods and and we're or nature is already
 
02:59:34.229 --> 02:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
suffering from 50% declines of say the
 
02:59:37.429 --> 02:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
gray fox the red fox the Martins the I'm
 
02:59:39.429 --> 02:59:39.439 align:start position:0%
not remembering the name of those scary
 
02:59:42.389 --> 02:59:42.399 align:start position:0%
ones the fisher cats the cats
 
02:59:48.990 --> 02:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:52.030 --> 02:59:52.040 align:start position:0%
having killing contests just gives an
 
02:59:54.389 --> 02:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
Open Season to further decimate the
 
02:59:57.110 --> 02:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
wildlife we have and cherish so thank
 
02:59:58.950 --> 02:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
you very
 
03:00:03.190 --> 03:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:12.110 --> 03:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:16.269 --> 03:00:16.279 align:start position:0%
Bosworth thank you Mr chair uh the uh
 
03:00:18.750 --> 03:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
Welden Bosworth from Guilford I did turn
 
03:00:21.150 --> 03:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
in some uh written testimony a couple of
 
03:00:24.670 --> 03:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
days ago and I will assume that you have
 
03:00:26.950 --> 03:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
already accessed it or you will I am
 
03:00:28.469 --> 03:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
just going to emphasize a couple of
 
03:00:31.670 --> 03:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
things and and talk about why we wanted
 
03:00:31.680 --> 03:00:32.349 align:start position:0%
things and and talk about why we wanted
this

03:00:32.349 --> 03:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:00:34.950 --> 03:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
bill unfortunately in New Hampshire
 
03:00:37.269 --> 03:00:37.279 align:start position:0%
there's many of our species are used as
 
03:00:38.990 --> 03:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
essentially disposable
 
03:00:41.190 --> 03:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
targets they're killed because some
 
03:00:43.190 --> 03:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
think some people think that the only
 
03:00:46.670 --> 03:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
good Predator is a dead one so you have
 
03:00:49.830 --> 03:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
people that uh hunt a variety of our
 
03:00:52.269 --> 03:00:52.279 align:start position:0%
Predators we have nine Predators now or
 
03:00:53.910 --> 03:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
what we call Miso Predators which has
 
03:00:56.030 --> 03:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
next step down like raccoons and so
 
03:00:59.790 --> 03:00:59.800 align:start position:0%
forth and these are kind of uh the way
 
03:01:02.469 --> 03:01:02.479 align:start position:0%
the seasons run in uh New Hampshire
 
03:01:04.670 --> 03:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
these are available to shoot the seasons
 
03:01:09.030 --> 03:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
are open on these species from five to 7
 
03:01:11.389 --> 03:01:11.399 align:start position:0%
months a year and you don't need to get
 
03:01:12.950 --> 03:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
a tag or a
 
03:01:16.590 --> 03:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
permit to shoot them and there's no duty
 
03:01:18.630 --> 03:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
to report if you kill
 
03:01:21.510 --> 03:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
them so we don't really know how many
 
03:01:24.990 --> 03:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
are shot but this is something where we
 
03:01:27.670 --> 03:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
have people that actually hunt these as
 
03:01:30.030 --> 03:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
Predators shoot them and because there's
 
03:01:33.190 --> 03:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
no Duty or no system for understanding
 
03:01:35.269 --> 03:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
how many are shot they're basically
 
03:01:38.510 --> 03:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
disposed of and there in lies the
 
03:01:41.110 --> 03:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
rationale for the W and waste other
 
03:01:42.990 --> 03:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
things happened that fall into that as
 
03:01:45.510 --> 03:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
well the second thing is the gentleman
 
03:01:47.309 --> 03:01:47.319 align:start position:0%
over here asked about Wildlife killing
 
03:01:47.319 --> 03:01:48.550 align:start position:0%
over here asked about Wildlife killing
contest

03:01:48.550 --> 03:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
contest
 
03:01:49.950 --> 03:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
there have been Wildlife killing
 
03:01:52.070 --> 03:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
contests in New Hampshire back three or
 
03:01:53.830 --> 03:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
four years ago there are three three or
 
03:01:56.190 --> 03:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
four different sporting goods shops that
 
03:02:00.510 --> 03:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh ran them I am unaware of any
 
03:02:03.389 --> 03:02:03.399 align:start position:0%
currently uh I think there was a lot of
 
03:02:05.710 --> 03:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
back in 2020 we actually introduced this
 
03:02:08.710 --> 03:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
Wildlife killing contest ban bill and I
 
03:02:09.790 --> 03:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
think some of that may have gone
 
03:02:12.309 --> 03:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
underground I don't know that but I
 
03:02:14.110 --> 03:02:14.120 align:start position:0%
think the important thing is with a ban
 
03:02:16.950 --> 03:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
on that we can be sure or reasonably
 
03:02:19.590 --> 03:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
sure that we won't have them anymore and
 
03:02:22.030 --> 03:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
that's the the basis and the rationale
 
03:02:25.309 --> 03:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
for submitting this bill uh thank you
 
03:02:26.910 --> 03:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
the rest of it in my testimony I
 
03:02:28.429 --> 03:02:28.439 align:start position:0%
submitted if there are any questions I'd
 
03:02:30.229 --> 03:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
be glad to entertain
 
03:02:32.630 --> 03:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
them thank you are there any questions
 
03:02:35.030 --> 03:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Durkin thank you for
 
03:02:36.790 --> 03:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you Mr speaker
 
03:02:38.309 --> 03:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question as more
 
03:02:40.190 --> 03:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
of a statement uh you made a statement
 
03:02:42.750 --> 03:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
that you think that these contests have
 
03:02:42.760 --> 03:02:43.870 align:start position:0%
that you think that these contests have
gone

03:02:43.870 --> 03:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
gone
 
03:02:45.950 --> 03:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
underground you should be really careful
 
03:02:47.510 --> 03:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
about saying something like that because
 
03:02:49.349 --> 03:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
that very misleading representative
 
03:02:51.349 --> 03:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
Durkin please make them actual questions
 
03:02:52.469 --> 03:02:52.479 align:start position:0%
okay I was just making a statement I'm
 
03:02:55.269 --> 03:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
sorry um so you don't know of
 
03:02:59.229 --> 03:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
any contests that going on presently I
 
03:03:02.030 --> 03:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
know of no killing con contest that's
 
03:03:04.389 --> 03:03:04.399 align:start position:0%
been generally advertised okay how about
 
03:03:06.309 --> 03:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
put it that way thank
 
03:03:08.990 --> 03:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
03:03:11.590 --> 03:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative tutor so when
 
03:03:14.469 --> 03:03:14.479 align:start position:0%
you go to the want and waste part of the
 
03:03:14.479 --> 03:03:16.269 align:start position:0%
you go to the want and waste part of the
bill

03:03:16.269 --> 03:03:16.279 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:03:19.590 --> 03:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
um someone should a fox or
 
03:03:22.469 --> 03:03:22.479 align:start position:0%
raccoon or Fisher I'm not sure what the
 
03:03:24.190 --> 03:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
season is on Fisher but there is seasons
 
03:03:27.190 --> 03:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
on the others yeah um you take expecting
 
03:03:29.309 --> 03:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
me to take it home and bake
 
03:03:31.630 --> 03:03:31.640 align:start position:0%
it uh you have you should have a purpose
 
03:03:33.269 --> 03:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
for doing it other than just to kill it
 
03:03:36.309 --> 03:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
in my estimation so basically the idea
 
03:03:39.349 --> 03:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
this ISS unless you use that so there's
 
03:03:43.389 --> 03:03:43.399 align:start position:0%
fur there's meat uh that's the use of a
 
03:03:45.510 --> 03:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
species so you need to have a rationale
 
03:03:48.710 --> 03:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
for taking its life
 
03:03:54.190 --> 03:03:54.200 align:start position:0%
does the uh followup Mr chair follow up
 
03:03:56.349 --> 03:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
um I guess this is the point of your
 
03:04:00.030 --> 03:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
bill but um the fishing game sets a bag
 
03:04:02.070 --> 03:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
limit for a certain number of animals
 
03:04:04.469 --> 03:04:04.479 align:start position:0%
that that I can shoot during a
 
03:04:08.870 --> 03:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
season um if I'm at the fur then yes I
 
03:04:11.510 --> 03:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
would keep the fur but I might read the
 
03:04:13.510 --> 03:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
cockus in the woods after I skinned it
 
03:04:14.950 --> 03:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
would you consider that to be want and
 
03:04:16.910 --> 03:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
waste it depends on what kind of carcass
 
03:04:19.710 --> 03:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
for instance if you shoot a deer usually
 
03:04:21.910 --> 03:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
you gut them in the woods and you take
 
03:04:24.429 --> 03:04:24.439 align:start position:0%
the whole the rest of the deer out the
 
03:04:26.510 --> 03:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
guts are left there
 
03:04:29.910 --> 03:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
right again clarifying followup Mr chair
 
03:04:32.389 --> 03:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
follow up again I'm back to the raccoon
 
03:04:35.070 --> 03:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
the fox the animals that you're probably
 
03:04:36.229 --> 03:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
not going to
 
03:04:39.710 --> 03:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
take then why would you shoot
 
03:04:42.630 --> 03:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
it well the use of the fur certainly
 
03:04:44.389 --> 03:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be included in the SWAT and
 
03:04:48.550 --> 03:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
waste all right never mind Mr I'm good
 
03:04:52.070 --> 03:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey um so I have here
 
03:04:54.630 --> 03:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
the the North American model of wildlife
 
03:04:57.590 --> 03:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
conservation um and I was briefly
 
03:05:00.269 --> 03:05:00.279 align:start position:0%
looking at it quickly last night
 
03:05:04.110 --> 03:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
isn't uh one of the tenants of that um
 
03:05:08.429 --> 03:05:08.439 align:start position:0%
conservation to not um encourage want
 
03:05:08.439 --> 03:05:09.710 align:start position:0%
conservation to not um encourage want
and

03:05:09.710 --> 03:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:05:11.870 --> 03:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
waste it depends on how you you can
 
03:05:15.150 --> 03:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
interpret some of that uh as one as not
 
03:05:20.269 --> 03:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
you as as referring to waste yes as uh
 
03:05:22.630 --> 03:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz said the the
 
03:05:25.150 --> 03:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
tenants that we basically hung our hat
 
03:05:27.309 --> 03:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
on there was that Wildlife should not be
 
03:05:30.550 --> 03:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:33.309 --> 03:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
reasons thank you yes I'm reading that
 
03:05:38.349 --> 03:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:40.750 --> 03:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:05:42.790 --> 03:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:05:45.269 --> 03:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question this may be a

Resources committee dear chairman
 
03:07:36.550 --> 03:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
members of the commission I did submit a
 
03:07:38.229 --> 03:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
PDF but for some reason it didn't go
 
03:07:39.790 --> 03:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
through so I'm just going to review what
 
03:07:41.790 --> 03:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
I had in my submission which you have a
 
03:07:44.389 --> 03:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
copy thank you today we seem to be on
 
03:07:46.429 --> 03:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
the presence of change chaos and the
 
03:07:48.269 --> 03:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
Very possibility to one day lose the
 
03:07:50.790 --> 03:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to voice our public opinions
 
03:07:52.590 --> 03:07:52.600 align:start position:0%
I am thankful to have this opportunity
 
03:07:55.349 --> 03:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
to do to do so today for the record I am
 
03:07:56.950 --> 03:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
asking you to ban The Killing contest
 
03:07:59.750 --> 03:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
and want and waste and approve of HB 589
 
03:08:02.429 --> 03:08:02.439 align:start position:0%
I can't even begin to comprehend why I
 
03:08:04.870 --> 03:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
or we even need to do this what is it
 
03:08:06.550 --> 03:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
about killing contests that's even
 
03:08:09.429 --> 03:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
remotely acceptable to anyone it should
 
03:08:12.429 --> 03:08:12.439 align:start position:0%
not be I'd ask each of you to have if
 
03:08:14.070 --> 03:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
you've given any thought to what a
 
03:08:16.389 --> 03:08:16.399 align:start position:0%
killing contest is and the repercussions
 
03:08:19.070 --> 03:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
of such when when I think of contests I
 
03:08:21.950 --> 03:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
think of fundraiser contests at schools
 
03:08:24.950 --> 03:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
sports dance or art contests killing
 
03:08:26.670 --> 03:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
contests are just another example of an
 
03:08:29.070 --> 03:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
allowable witnessed in humanity to
 
03:08:31.950 --> 03:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
another living being killing contests
 
03:08:33.990 --> 03:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
have been documented in our bloody
 
03:08:36.590 --> 03:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
barbaric cruel and I would also add a
 
03:08:39.110 --> 03:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
perverse excuse to destroy and even at
 
03:08:42.750 --> 03:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
times torture for some unfounded excuses
 
03:08:44.469 --> 03:08:44.479 align:start position:0%
do you believe in dog fighting do you
 
03:08:45.710 --> 03:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
believe in
 
03:08:48.590 --> 03:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
fighting do you believe allowing people
 
03:08:50.750 --> 03:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
to chase down coyote any time of the day
 
03:08:53.190 --> 03:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
or night year round be it a pregnant or
 
03:08:55.790 --> 03:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
nursing mother or a pup and then shoot
 
03:08:57.190 --> 03:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
them through the stomach so they can
 
03:09:00.670 --> 03:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
suffer and bleed to death is ethical it
 
03:09:03.389 --> 03:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
is a well documented that coyote are
 
03:09:05.190 --> 03:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
chased by hounds for miles to their
 
03:09:07.229 --> 03:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
death exhaustion or chased down by
 
03:09:10.550 --> 03:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles injured and maimed disabled
 
03:09:13.550 --> 03:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
until they are killed yes sadly even
 
03:09:15.870 --> 03:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
this is considered acceptable and not
 
03:09:18.030 --> 03:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
illegal in New Hampshire
 
03:09:20.630 --> 03:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
imagine for just one moment the stress
 
03:09:22.950 --> 03:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
horror suffering and pain these animals
 
03:09:24.950 --> 03:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
must endure for the sake of some
 
03:09:28.110 --> 03:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
gruesome bloody contest this is not a
 
03:09:30.309 --> 03:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
form of ethical Fair Chase hunting or
 
03:09:32.790 --> 03:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
even a resource for food there they
 
03:09:35.110 --> 03:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
become want in waste of animal bodies
 
03:09:37.910 --> 03:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
maimed tortured and killed left to rot
 
03:09:40.469 --> 03:09:40.479 align:start position:0%
in their pool of blood it is the epitome
 
03:09:43.309 --> 03:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
of inhumanity these contests are not
 
03:09:45.750 --> 03:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
always publicly visible as with social
 
03:09:47.710 --> 03:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
media and the internet there is a dark
 
03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
circle of shared information that
 
03:09:52.190 --> 03:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
perpetuates this very real vilification
 
03:09:54.229 --> 03:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
of coyotes here in New Hampshire and
 
03:09:56.990 --> 03:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
across the country do you know that even
 
03:09:58.950 --> 03:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
young impressionable children attend
 
03:10:01.670 --> 03:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
these contests what part of a civil
 
03:10:04.309 --> 03:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
society AG agrees to allows this
 
03:10:06.590 --> 03:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
bloodthirsty barbaric and most vile form
 
03:10:09.550 --> 03:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
of animal abuse toward a wild animal my
 
03:10:11.910 --> 03:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
dear parents never lost their sense of
 
03:10:14.070 --> 03:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
right and wrong morals ethics and how to
 
03:10:15.870 --> 03:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
be a good neighbor and respect for all
 
03:10:18.590 --> 03:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
things they taught me and my siblings by
 
03:10:21.070 --> 03:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
word and by example and I'm truly
 
03:10:23.550 --> 03:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
grateful to them I have spent my adult
 
03:10:25.349 --> 03:10:25.359 align:start position:0%
career in the healthc care profession
 
03:10:27.790 --> 03:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
treating and caring for people I can
 
03:10:29.389 --> 03:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
honestly say that there is no question
 
03:10:31.550 --> 03:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
in my mind or in the many people I have
 
03:10:34.590 --> 03:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
spoken with and work with that no one
 
03:10:36.229 --> 03:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
agrees that killing contests are
 
03:10:38.030 --> 03:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
acceptable but rather are a cruel and
 
03:10:40.830 --> 03:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
barbaric bloody ugly stain on New
 
03:10:42.790 --> 03:10:42.800 align:start position:0%

03:11:46.790 --> 03:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
assure you that Colonel Jordan would
 
03:11:48.630 --> 03:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
certainly charge anyone who tried to
 
03:11:50.830 --> 03:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
chase down coyotes with a snowmobile and
 
03:11:53.670 --> 03:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
run them over or maim them it is against

Wildlife killing contest in the state of
 
03:12:47.200 --> 03:12:47.950 align:start position:0%
Wildlife killing contest in the state of
New

03:12:47.950 --> 03:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
New
 
03:12:50.389 --> 03:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my support for this bill is
 
03:12:53.190 --> 03:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
based on three principles I believe in
 
03:12:55.950 --> 03:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
science-based management of Nature and
 
03:12:59.070 --> 03:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
Wildlife I support Second principle I
 
03:13:01.790 --> 03:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
support and respect hunters and hunting
 
03:13:03.790 --> 03:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
and the valuable role that they play in
 
03:13:06.229 --> 03:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
keeping our ecosystem in
 
03:13:08.830 --> 03:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
Balance the third principle I believe
 
03:13:10.670 --> 03:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
that the natural world of my state of
 
03:13:13.030 --> 03:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire belongs to all of us as
 
03:13:15.750 --> 03:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
well as to our children and to our
 
03:13:17.830 --> 03:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
grandchildren I have not not seen any
 
03:13:19.630 --> 03:13:19.640 align:start position:0%
evidence to suggest that Wildlife
 
03:13:21.910 --> 03:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
killing contests can be reconciled with
 
03:13:24.469 --> 03:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
any of these three principles that I've
 
03:13:27.870 --> 03:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned regarding my first principle
 
03:13:30.150 --> 03:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
science-based Wildlife Management I've
 
03:13:32.150 --> 03:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
spent many hours reading studies and
 
03:13:34.950 --> 03:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
doing research and I've not been able to
 
03:13:37.389 --> 03:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
find a single study that shows that
 
03:13:39.990 --> 03:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
Wildlife killing contests help the
 
03:13:42.389 --> 03:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
Predator prey balance nor improve
 
03:13:45.349 --> 03:13:45.359 align:start position:0%
livestock protection but I was able to
 
03:13:48.110 --> 03:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
read study after study including ones
 
03:13:50.790 --> 03:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
conducted by UNH scientists that
 
03:13:52.830 --> 03:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
indicated that indiscriminate lethal
 
03:13:54.469 --> 03:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
control of predators can be
 
03:13:56.389 --> 03:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
counterproductive often leading to
 
03:13:59.030 --> 03:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
increased Predator populations due to
 
03:14:00.910 --> 03:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
Adaptive reproductive
 
03:14:03.750 --> 03:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
strategies the same studies also
 
03:14:06.269 --> 03:14:06.279 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that non-lethal methods of
 
03:14:08.429 --> 03:14:08.439 align:start position:0%
management had just as much or perhaps
 
03:14:11.870 --> 03:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
more benefit than lethal ones this also
 
03:14:14.950 --> 03:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
helped to explain to me why 10 states
 
03:14:17.670 --> 03:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
all with active and cherished hunting
 
03:14:20.110 --> 03:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
itions uh have already banned Wildlife
 
03:14:22.630 --> 03:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
killing contests the boards of these
 
03:14:24.790 --> 03:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
States including Vermont Arizona New
 
03:14:26.750 --> 03:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
York and others reviewed the science and
 
03:14:29.229 --> 03:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
came to the same
 
03:14:31.710 --> 03:14:31.720 align:start position:0%
conclusion regarding my second principle
 
03:14:33.710 --> 03:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
hunters and the valuable role they play
 
03:14:35.910 --> 03:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
in balancing Wildlife populations I
 
03:14:37.870 --> 03:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
could find no evidence that Wildlife
 
03:14:40.150 --> 03:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
killing contests specifically provide
 
03:14:42.790 --> 03:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
any benefit to that cause nor to the
 
03:14:45.030 --> 03:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
exercise or enjoyment of hunting in
 
03:14:47.469 --> 03:14:47.479 align:start position:0%
general I did find that at at least some
 
03:14:49.830 --> 03:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
Hunters worry that Wildlife killing
 
03:14:52.309 --> 03:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
contests create a negative image of
 
03:14:55.510 --> 03:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
hunting and potentially harm public
 
03:14:58.190 --> 03:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
opinion supporting this concern I found
 
03:15:01.429 --> 03:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
that 84% of Americans agree with hunting
 
03:15:03.670 --> 03:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
for meat according to the council to
 
03:15:05.950 --> 03:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
advance hunting and the Shooting Sports
 
03:15:09.710 --> 03:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
while only 14% support killing contests
 
03:15:12.550 --> 03:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
according to a 2022 Remington research
 
03:15:14.990 --> 03:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
group poll so it's clear that there's
 
03:15:16.990 --> 03:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
wide support for hunting but only
 
03:15:19.269 --> 03:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
limited support for
 
03:15:22.030 --> 03:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
contests regarding my third principle
 
03:15:24.150 --> 03:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
that the natural world belongs to all of
 
03:15:26.550 --> 03:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
us this is the one that motivated me
 
03:15:28.269 --> 03:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
most to speak here
 
03:15:31.189 --> 03:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
today as I was researching the subject a
 
03:15:33.309 --> 03:15:33.319 align:start position:0%
specific article and interview jumped
 
03:15:36.030 --> 03:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
out at me and in the article there was a
 
03:15:39.469 --> 03:15:39.479 align:start position:0%
gentleman who was president uh of an
 
03:15:41.389 --> 03:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
organization called The Mohawk Valley
 
03:15:44.070 --> 03:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
 and Cat Club just came up in the
 
03:15:46.990 --> 03:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
article uh and he said that Wildlife con
 
03:15:48.790 --> 03:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
contest this is in New York the wildlife
 
03:15:52.110 --> 03:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
contest helps sustain his organization's
 
03:15:54.189 --> 03:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
membership uh he also said that even
 
03:15:56.150 --> 03:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
though New York banned the contest that
 
03:15:57.830 --> 03:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
he would continue holding them under
 
03:16:00.349 --> 03:16:00.359 align:start position:0%
under another name and the exact quote
 
03:16:02.429 --> 03:16:02.439 align:start position:0%
that stood out to me in this public
 
03:16:05.110 --> 03:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
article said some of our guys have
 
03:16:08.030 --> 03:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
$6,000 scopes on their rifles and
 
03:16:09.309 --> 03:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
they're never going to get to use them
 
03:16:11.630 --> 03:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
for anything else this club has been in
 
03:16:13.590 --> 03:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
my family since the 40s and I don't want
 
03:16:17.469 --> 03:16:17.479 align:start position:0%
to lose it so my question is is as a
 
03:16:19.429 --> 03:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
citizen of any state whether it's New
 
03:16:22.150 --> 03:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
York or New Hampshire why does a small
 
03:16:25.030 --> 03:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
group of people in a private club get to
 
03:16:26.910 --> 03:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
dictate interests that are for their
 
03:16:29.670 --> 03:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
monetary benefit when the majority of
 
03:16:33.150 --> 03:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
the opinion is against this Behavior the
 
03:16:35.229 --> 03:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
wildlife and public land in my state
 
03:16:37.110 --> 03:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
belongs to everyone and it should be
 
03:16:38.710 --> 03:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
carefully managed according to
 
03:16:40.670 --> 03:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
Scientific principles that benefit us
 
03:16:43.590 --> 03:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
all and not the special interests of of
 
03:16:46.309 --> 03:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
a few in a private club thank you Mr
 
03:16:47.429 --> 03:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
chairman and
 
03:16:49.389 --> 03:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for your testimony
 
03:16:51.269 --> 03:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
03:16:53.429 --> 03:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
03:16:53.439 --> 03:16:57.229 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
time

03:16:57.229 --> 03:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:15.070 --> 03:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:17.870 --> 03:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
O'Brien thank you chair
 
03:17:20.070 --> 03:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Joan
 
03:17:23.269 --> 03:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
O'Brien and I'm from amher New Hampshire
 
03:17:27.030 --> 03:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
and I am here uh in support of HB 589
 
03:17:29.510 --> 03:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
not just for myself but for everybody in
 
03:17:31.950 --> 03:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
my life who reacts with shock and
 
03:17:33.630 --> 03:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
disbelief when I tell them there's such
 
03:17:36.349 --> 03:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
a thing as a wock killing
 
03:17:38.830 --> 03:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
contest I believe that killing contests
 
03:17:41.469 --> 03:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
where an entire species is vilified and
 
03:17:44.389 --> 03:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
set aside for extermination embodies the
 
03:17:47.309 --> 03:17:47.319 align:start position:0%
worst of human nature
 
03:17:49.590 --> 03:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
and two aspects that are extremely
 
03:17:51.110 --> 03:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
disturbing have already been mentioned
 
03:17:53.030 --> 03:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
but I'll mention them again is the
 
03:17:56.309 --> 03:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
presence of children at these
 
03:17:59.870 --> 03:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
events children at these events are
 
03:18:02.510 --> 03:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
going to become desensitized to violence
 
03:18:03.469 --> 03:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
and to
 
03:18:05.630 --> 03:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
suffering and they're going to see the
 
03:18:08.070 --> 03:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
adults in their lives modeling that it's
 
03:18:11.590 --> 03:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
okay to treat certain animals like
 
03:18:13.870 --> 03:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
garbage and the second thing that really
 
03:18:15.309 --> 03:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
concerns me is the use of the
 
03:18:17.269 --> 03:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
high-powered weaponry
 
03:18:20.429 --> 03:18:20.439 align:start position:0%
I also had the quote we just heard about
 
03:18:23.150 --> 03:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
the gun club owner saying my guys have
 
03:18:25.269 --> 03:18:25.279 align:start position:0%
these $66,000 Scopes where else are they
 
03:18:26.830 --> 03:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
going to be able to use
 
03:18:29.510 --> 03:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
them and in my photos you're going to
 
03:18:31.349 --> 03:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
see a picture of a couple of guys
 
03:18:33.269 --> 03:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
dressed like they're about to go into
 
03:18:37.510 --> 03:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
Iraq and they to kill two innocent
 
03:18:40.150 --> 03:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
foxes defenseless
 
03:18:42.510 --> 03:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
animals Wildlife killing contests have
 
03:18:45.030 --> 03:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
no place in the civilized society and I
 
03:18:46.990 --> 03:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to support this Bill
 
03:18:50.750 --> 03:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
and end these senseless massacres thank
 
03:18:54.070 --> 03:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you are there any questions
 
03:18:56.710 --> 03:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
representative ulet please uh thank you
 
03:18:57.950 --> 03:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:18:59.510 --> 03:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
question I see the picture of the two
 
03:19:01.990 --> 03:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
gentlemen on the back with the two foxes
 
03:19:05.990 --> 03:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:08.670 --> 03:19:08.680 align:start position:0%
illegal apparently not thank I mean I
 
03:19:10.389 --> 03:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
don't know what state that is it's but
 
03:19:13.229 --> 03:19:13.239 align:start position:0%
it's ex it it illustrates what these
 
03:19:15.189 --> 03:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
things look like even if this isn't New
 
03:19:18.710 --> 03:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it could well be New
 
03:19:21.710 --> 03:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire follow up but you don't know
 
03:19:23.590 --> 03:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
of any
 
03:19:27.469 --> 03:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
um of the I do not know of any killing
 
03:19:27.479 --> 03:19:29.469 align:start position:0%
um of the I do not know of any killing
contests

03:19:29.469 --> 03:19:29.479 align:start position:0%
contests
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
personally representative
 
03:19:34.189 --> 03:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
Khan thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:19:36.630 --> 03:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions uh because we
 
03:19:38.189 --> 03:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
are talking
 
03:19:41.150 --> 03:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
about making a law in New Hampshire can
 
03:19:43.670 --> 03:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
you tell us that all these picture I'm
 
03:19:45.910 --> 03:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
seeing these pictures are from New
 
03:19:48.710 --> 03:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no I I cannot tell you that
 
03:19:50.910 --> 03:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
they're from New Hampshire again they
 
03:19:53.469 --> 03:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
could well be it's the same kind of
 
03:19:55.670 --> 03:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
contests they're happening in all but
 
03:19:58.510 --> 03:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
like five states Across the
 
03:20:00.910 --> 03:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
Nation any other
 
03:20:03.110 --> 03:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
03:20:03.120 --> 03:20:06.429 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
time

03:20:06.429 --> 03:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:20.670 --> 03:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:24.389 --> 03:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
hello um thank you for letting me speak
 
03:20:24.399 --> 03:20:26.070 align:start position:0%
hello um thank you for letting me speak
um

03:20:26.070 --> 03:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:29.269 --> 03:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh um and thank you for considering this
 
03:20:33.070 --> 03:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
SP um all of you um committee members um
 
03:20:35.229 --> 03:20:35.239 align:start position:0%
this is a no-brainer for me um of course
 
03:20:37.349 --> 03:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
we should ban um Wildlife killing
 
03:20:40.750 --> 03:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
contests um and I I want to say that I I
 
03:20:42.070 --> 03:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
brought my third grade daughter here
 
03:20:45.469 --> 03:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
today um she loves animals um especially
 
03:20:47.870 --> 03:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
wolves and bobcats
 
03:20:49.510 --> 03:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
I told her about the band because I just
 
03:20:51.429 --> 03:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
learned about it um like a couple days
 
03:20:54.870 --> 03:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
ago and she was so upset to learn that
 
03:20:56.070 --> 03:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
they were allowed in New Hampshire in
 
03:20:58.349 --> 03:20:58.359 align:start position:0%
the first place I actually let her miss
 
03:21:00.070 --> 03:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
school today so she could be here and
 
03:21:02.590 --> 03:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
see how our government works um
 
03:21:04.070 --> 03:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
particularly with something that she
 
03:21:05.950 --> 03:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
cares so much about I asked her if she
 
03:21:09.630 --> 03:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak but understandably she
 
03:21:09.640 --> 03:21:11.630 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak but understandably she
declined

03:21:11.630 --> 03:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
declined
 
03:21:14.469 --> 03:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
so I also wanted to tell you of
 
03:21:15.990 --> 03:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
something that happened when I was about
 
03:21:19.229 --> 03:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
seven or eight years old old um a friend
 
03:21:22.590 --> 03:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
told me of a place called cat hell um
 
03:21:24.389 --> 03:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
and they said where any cat that goes
 
03:21:26.189 --> 03:21:26.199 align:start position:0%
there they get shot on
 
03:21:28.630 --> 03:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
site I don't know if it was true I was
 
03:21:31.550 --> 03:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
seven or eight but I believe them and
 
03:21:34.189 --> 03:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
the idea of it horrified me and it stuck
 
03:21:37.349 --> 03:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
with me I'm 51 now I still remember
 
03:21:38.990 --> 03:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
learning about
 
03:21:43.070 --> 03:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
catell and the idea um the shooting on
 
03:21:45.110 --> 03:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
sight and the complete disregard for the
 
03:21:47.110 --> 03:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
life of the animal was what was so
 
03:21:49.750 --> 03:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
horrifying I mean I knew that cats were
 
03:21:51.670 --> 03:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
euthanized at shelters and pounds like
 
03:21:53.590 --> 03:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's not like I was like ah no desk
 
03:21:56.670 --> 03:21:56.680 align:start position:0%
never um but I think it was that
 
03:22:00.429 --> 03:22:00.439 align:start position:0%
shooting on site for fun just um almost
 
03:22:01.870 --> 03:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
like a contest
 
03:22:05.349 --> 03:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
there um and to kill in the name of
 
03:22:07.670 --> 03:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
wildlife control is
 
03:22:09.990 --> 03:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
wrong New Hampshire is better at
 
03:22:12.189 --> 03:22:12.199 align:start position:0%
wildlife control that meaning killing
 
03:22:14.750 --> 03:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
contests um we have very highly trained
 
03:22:17.910 --> 03:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
people who do that for a living
 
03:22:20.469 --> 03:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
um and just because something is wild
 
03:22:23.469 --> 03:22:23.479 align:start position:0%
and not domesticated sorry does not mean
 
03:22:25.070 --> 03:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
it should be legally bound to such
 
03:22:26.630 --> 03:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
treatment that is not appropriate
 
03:22:29.349 --> 03:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
wildlife control so please each of you
 
03:22:31.990 --> 03:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
on this committee I implore you not to
 
03:22:34.590 --> 03:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
yield to a minority who must want to
 
03:22:37.389 --> 03:22:37.399 align:start position:0%
keep these killing contests I guess in
 
03:22:39.830 --> 03:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
the name of Heritage or tradition
 
03:22:41.550 --> 03:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
although as somebody mentioned I mean
 
03:22:43.550 --> 03:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
some people Proclaim dog fighting as
 
03:22:46.110 --> 03:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
their Heritage and tradition and I want
 
03:22:47.550 --> 03:22:47.560 align:start position:0%
you to please think of what this
 
03:22:49.630 --> 03:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
decision says to our children and future
 
03:22:51.870 --> 03:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
Generations your ability to pass
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
legislation is such an important tool I
 
03:22:56.269 --> 03:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
don't need to tell you that you all know
 
03:22:59.710 --> 03:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
that past legislators excuse me past
 
03:23:03.030 --> 03:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
legislators and citizens um we can thank
 
03:23:04.990 --> 03:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
for why we have laws prohibiting adults
 
03:23:06.990 --> 03:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
from beating their children for
 
03:23:09.590 --> 03:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
example and that was not always the case
 
03:23:11.429 --> 03:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
in our history as I'm sure many of you
 
03:23:13.910 --> 03:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
know if uh those of you are students of
 
03:23:17.189 --> 03:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
History um some of the ear protections
 
03:23:18.830 --> 03:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
for children in our country arose by
 
03:23:21.229 --> 03:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
arguing the fact that laws existed that
 
03:23:23.550 --> 03:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
would have protected an animal from
 
03:23:25.189 --> 03:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
enduring the same treatment that this
 
03:23:27.990 --> 03:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
child was undergoing now I must say how
 
03:23:31.229 --> 03:23:31.239 align:start position:0%
sad that children needed to be at least
 
03:23:33.389 --> 03:23:33.399 align:start position:0%
considered on the level of animals to
 
03:23:36.150 --> 03:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
get that basic protection um but how
 
03:23:38.830 --> 03:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
important having those laws on the books
 
03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
was we need to have basic protections
 
03:23:43.630 --> 03:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
from some of the worst types of
 
03:23:46.070 --> 03:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
treatment that are possible even for
 
03:23:48.269 --> 03:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
animals anal even for
 
03:23:50.469 --> 03:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
Animals Wildlife killing contest
 
03:23:52.830 --> 03:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
squarely goes into that category of some
 
03:23:54.389 --> 03:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
of the worst types of treatment that are
 
03:23:56.469 --> 03:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
possible um thank you for your time and

03:24:25.990 --> 03:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
the chair calls
 
03:24:30.349 --> 03:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:40.990 --> 03:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:43.030 --> 03:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
worked good afternoon chairman and
 
03:24:44.910 --> 03:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
distinguished members of the fishing
 
03:24:47.950 --> 03:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
game committee my name is lucel JR I
 
03:24:49.910 --> 03:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
live in new ipswitch with my wife and
 
03:24:52.469 --> 03:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
two wonderful huskys I have spent the
 
03:24:54.750 --> 03:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
majority of my life keeping people safe
 
03:24:56.030 --> 03:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
but I realized it was time for me to
 
03:24:59.070 --> 03:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
make a change I was an EMT for 15 years
 
03:25:00.630 --> 03:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
I went on to be a police officer in New
 
03:25:02.710 --> 03:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for 15 years and I retired
 
03:25:05.189 --> 03:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
after that I then went to work in a
 
03:25:06.910 --> 03:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
hospital in New Hampshire in Chief of
 
03:25:09.349 --> 03:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
chief of security keeping people safe
 
03:25:11.150 --> 03:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
and since then I've been in a in a
 
03:25:13.229 --> 03:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
safety coordinated role in Manch
 
03:25:14.429 --> 03:25:14.439 align:start position:0%
Manchester for the last two and a half
 
03:25:17.030 --> 03:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
years during all this time the care and
 
03:25:19.070 --> 03:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
respect of animals has always been my my
 
03:25:21.349 --> 03:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
passion and since animals do not have a
 
03:25:23.389 --> 03:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
voice I'm going to use mine today to
 
03:25:25.510 --> 03:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
advocate for them I'm also going to be
 
03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
repeating some of the things but that
 
03:25:28.750 --> 03:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
have been said and I think it's worth to
 
03:25:30.309 --> 03:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
hear them and they were all very good
 
03:25:33.429 --> 03:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
points I promise to be brief but when
 
03:25:35.030 --> 03:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
I'm done here today I hope I leave you
 
03:25:37.990 --> 03:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
with one thing my passion for Animals
 
03:25:39.630 --> 03:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
before I ask for your support I'd like
 
03:25:41.469 --> 03:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
to outline the wildlife killing contest
 
03:25:42.910 --> 03:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
and I realized some of this has been
 
03:25:45.870 --> 03:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
said but but it's easier for me just to
 
03:25:46.870 --> 03:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
say it
 
03:25:48.469 --> 03:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh these contests are nothing more than
 
03:25:50.910 --> 03:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
recreational and organized Slaughter
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
they may take place over a specific
 
03:25:55.189 --> 03:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
period of time such as 24 48 hours
 
03:25:57.070 --> 03:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
during this time the goal is to kill as
 
03:25:59.189 --> 03:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
many animals as possible and the one
 
03:26:01.229 --> 03:26:01.239 align:start position:0%
that has the most combined weight of
 
03:26:04.469 --> 03:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
dead animals wins the prize if larger
 
03:26:06.469 --> 03:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
animals are not available any animal
 
03:26:08.710 --> 03:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
will do the more animals that are killed
 
03:26:10.950 --> 03:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
the better one has the chance to win a
 
03:26:13.910 --> 03:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
contest sadly our most impressionable
 
03:26:15.790 --> 03:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
children often witness or participated
 
03:26:17.590 --> 03:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
in these cont contest with all the
 
03:26:19.150 --> 03:26:19.160 align:start position:0%
violence our children are regularly
 
03:26:21.590 --> 03:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
exposed to these contests send a message
 
03:26:23.670 --> 03:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
that it's fun or thrilling to kill as
 
03:26:26.110 --> 03:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
many animals as you can this should not
 
03:26:27.670 --> 03:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
be the Legacy we want to leave our
 
03:26:27.680 --> 03:26:29.150 align:start position:0%
be the Legacy we want to leave our
future

03:26:29.150 --> 03:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
future
 
03:26:31.510 --> 03:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
generations to put things in perspective
 
03:26:34.030 --> 03:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
I outlined eight brief talking points
 
03:26:36.510 --> 03:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
first one being respect Wildlife killing
 
03:26:39.269 --> 03:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
contests do not respect Wildlife all
 
03:26:41.510 --> 03:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
they do is promote a culture of hate and
 
03:26:44.269 --> 03:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
disrespect towards animals ecological
 
03:26:46.790 --> 03:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
balance Wildlife plays a crucial role in
 
03:26:49.110 --> 03:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
maintaining our ecosystem these killing
 
03:26:50.910 --> 03:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
contests disrupt its balance and can
 
03:26:53.910 --> 03:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
greatly affect all nearby Wildlife
 
03:26:56.630 --> 03:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
populations Banning uh Wildlife killing
 
03:26:59.550 --> 03:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
contest does not mean Banning hunting I
 
03:27:01.630 --> 03:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
understand and support e ethical hunting
 
03:27:04.469 --> 03:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
practices but killing contests are not
 
03:27:07.309 --> 03:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
ethical other states as was mentioned
 
03:27:10.189 --> 03:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
our neighbors Massachusetts and Vermont
 
03:27:13.269 --> 03:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
Arizona California Colorado Maryland New
 
03:27:16.189 --> 03:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
Mexico New York Oregon and Washington
 
03:27:19.830 --> 03:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
all B East killing contest wrong message
 
03:27:22.269 --> 03:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
to our youth as I said the wildlife
 
03:27:23.990 --> 03:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
killing contest send a wrong message to
 
03:27:26.150 --> 03:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
our young people they are desensitizing
 
03:27:28.750 --> 03:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
them and giving them and teaching them
 
03:27:30.590 --> 03:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
that killing as many animals as you can
 
03:27:33.150 --> 03:27:33.160 align:start position:0%
is acceptable given the unsettling times
 
03:27:35.229 --> 03:27:35.239 align:start position:0%
we are living in these days we should be
 
03:27:37.030 --> 03:27:37.040 align:start position:0%

to respect all forms of life instead of
 
03:27:41.710 --> 03:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
killing as much as they can the right
 
03:27:43.910 --> 03:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
thing to do doing the right thing is
 
03:27:45.469 --> 03:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
often the wrong thing for those who do
 
03:27:47.910 --> 03:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
not respect the law or care about why
 
03:27:51.349 --> 03:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
life public sentiment many people in our
 
03:27:52.990 --> 03:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
entire Society throughout this country
 
03:27:55.070 --> 03:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
view these contests as inhumane and
 
03:27:57.189 --> 03:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
unethical Banning them would reflect the
 
03:27:59.429 --> 03:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
evolving public sentiment toward
 
03:28:01.950 --> 03:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Conservation uh conservation
 
03:28:04.030 --> 03:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
and would be a message support from you
 
03:28:05.950 --> 03:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
in the state of New

in the state of New
Hampshire

03:28:07.510 --> 03:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:28:09.910 --> 03:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
YouTube I had the misp pleasure of
 
03:28:12.590 --> 03:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
watching a YouTube video on this topic
 
03:28:15.070 --> 03:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
and during this topic it was a 20 it was
 
03:28:16.790 --> 03:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
a 48 hour period
 
03:28:18.950 --> 03:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
these contests were held for bragging
 
03:28:21.630 --> 03:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
rights a large cash prize or in some
 
03:28:23.630 --> 03:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
case an assault rifle loaded up with all
 
03:28:26.110 --> 03:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
the fancy options comments on the video
 
03:28:29.429 --> 03:28:29.439 align:start position:0%
range from enjoyable it's the thrill I
 
03:28:32.070 --> 03:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
got to use my AR-15 with night vision or
 
03:28:34.030 --> 03:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
it's a tradition when we get together to
 
03:28:35.790 --> 03:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
go out and kill as many animals as we
 
03:28:38.630 --> 03:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
can to get as many animals as they can
 
03:28:40.590 --> 03:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
animals are often killed at night with
 
03:28:42.429 --> 03:28:42.439 align:start position:0%
the use of an assault rifle they may be
 
03:28:44.750 --> 03:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
baited and trapped and then killed how
 
03:28:46.670 --> 03:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
is that considered a sport I can't even
 
03:28:49.349 --> 03:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
comprehend that I did attach which you
 
03:28:51.070 --> 03:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
probably seen two articles that are not
 
03:28:52.630 --> 03:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
pleasant to look at but they do
 
03:28:54.590 --> 03:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
illustrate the reality of what happening
 
03:28:56.550 --> 03:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
in these contests I believe they would
 
03:28:58.710 --> 03:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
be beneficial if if you would uh
 
03:29:00.429 --> 03:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
beneficial to read if you for you to
 
03:29:02.269 --> 03:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
decide on this matter in speaking to a
 
03:29:04.030 --> 03:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
point that was raised earlier not
 
03:29:05.429 --> 03:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
knowing if these pitches are from New
 
03:29:07.229 --> 03:29:07.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or not they don't have to be
 
03:29:09.070 --> 03:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
we can stop it before they
 
03:29:11.510 --> 03:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
are I've been around long enough to
 
03:29:12.670 --> 03:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
understand that there are two sides of
 
03:29:14.630 --> 03:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
every story in this case the only other
 
03:29:16.389 --> 03:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
side I can think of is the total lack of
 
03:29:18.790 --> 03:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
respect for wildlife in one's thrill of
 
03:29:21.070 --> 03:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
killing Mr chairman and distinguished
 
03:29:23.150 --> 03:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
committee members I respectfully ask
 
03:29:25.030 --> 03:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
that you consider enacting legislation
 
03:29:28.189 --> 03:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
such as House Bill 589 that bans these
 
03:29:30.389 --> 03:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
contests I also hope you'll do the right
 
03:29:31.750 --> 03:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
thing by having the Hampshire join the
 
03:29:34.670 --> 03:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
10 states and become the 11th state to
 
03:29:36.510 --> 03:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
put an end to these contests thank you
 
03:29:38.030 --> 03:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
for listening to me I appreciate your
 
03:29:39.349 --> 03:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
support and thank you for your service
 
03:29:42.189 --> 03:29:42.199 align:start position:0%
to our great state thank you are there
 
03:29:42.199 --> 03:29:43.150 align:start position:0%
to our great state thank you are there
any

03:29:43.150 --> 03:29:43.160 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:29:45.189 --> 03:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
03:29:51.870 --> 03:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:02.630 --> 03:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:05.030 --> 03:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
borers hi there everybody thank you for
 
03:30:07.870 --> 03:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
listening to me um I'm micaa borers from
 
03:30:11.030 --> 03:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
Tilton um and I'm here in support of uh
 
03:30:15.030 --> 03:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
HP 589 so um today you are considering a
 
03:30:16.990 --> 03:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
law prohibiting killing contests and
 
03:30:19.469 --> 03:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
want and waste in our state it's my
 
03:30:22.309 --> 03:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
opinion these contests are far Far Cry
 
03:30:24.389 --> 03:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
from ethical hunting I believe they
 
03:30:26.830 --> 03:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
incentivize sadism and Foster especially
 
03:30:29.189 --> 03:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
in our young people a dismissive and
 
03:30:31.590 --> 03:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
disrespectful attitude towards wildlife
 
03:30:34.510 --> 03:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
and life in general as you probably know
 
03:30:36.750 --> 03:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
deer hunting is highly regulated versus
 
03:30:38.990 --> 03:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
the take of furbearers like foxes and
 
03:30:41.550 --> 03:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
coyotes presently the coyote season is
 
03:30:44.110 --> 03:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
open year round even during pop rearing
 
03:30:46.349 --> 03:30:46.359 align:start position:0%
season and neither coyote or Fox have
 
03:30:48.790 --> 03:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
bagging limits although some of fishing
 
03:30:51.110 --> 03:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
games officials would have you believe
 
03:30:54.030 --> 03:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
both species populations are abundant
 
03:30:57.309 --> 03:30:57.319 align:start position:0%
there's a dir of hard data to support
 
03:30:59.389 --> 03:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
this claim and as a matter of fact
 
03:31:01.349 --> 03:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
trapping results indicate a possible
 
03:31:04.030 --> 03:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
decline in red and gray fox these
 
03:31:06.349 --> 03:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
results are all we have to go off of
 
03:31:08.030 --> 03:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
since no further research has been
 
03:31:11.110 --> 03:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
conducted um I did hand out some papers
 
03:31:13.790 --> 03:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
so you should have those graphs actually
 
03:31:16.110 --> 03:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
um knowing this our state's current
 
03:31:18.110 --> 03:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
management of foxes and coyotes is at
 
03:31:20.830 --> 03:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
best uninformed and Reckless imagine if
 
03:31:22.349 --> 03:31:22.359 align:start position:0%
Hunters went in the woods to shoot as
 
03:31:24.590 --> 03:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
many deer as they could dragged them all
 
03:31:26.990 --> 03:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
back to count and stack in a pile and
 
03:31:29.229 --> 03:31:29.239 align:start position:0%
some guy was handed a new gun in 100
 
03:31:30.790 --> 03:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
bucks for killing the most deer out of
 
03:31:32.790 --> 03:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
everyone else then all the bodies were
 
03:31:35.189 --> 03:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
left to rot in the woods imagine the
 
03:31:37.429 --> 03:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
outcry fishing game would not allow that
 
03:31:39.510 --> 03:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
because they understand it's a huge
 
03:31:41.590 --> 03:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
waste of life and resources and would
 
03:31:43.469 --> 03:31:43.479 align:start position:0%
have detrimental impacts on the deer
 
03:31:45.469 --> 03:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
population but that's exactly what they
 
03:31:47.110 --> 03:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
do to coyotes and
 
03:31:49.910 --> 03:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
foxes in my high school ethics class I
 
03:31:51.670 --> 03:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
developed the philosophy that although
 
03:31:53.510 --> 03:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
the consequences of our actions are not
 
03:31:55.990 --> 03:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
Inc consequential the majority of the
 
03:31:57.670 --> 03:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
moral activity occurs on the
 
03:32:00.349 --> 03:32:00.359 align:start position:0%
motivational level why do people kill
 
03:32:02.710 --> 03:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
Wildlife well folks kill deer to feed
 
03:32:05.070 --> 03:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
their families but people kill coyotes
 
03:32:06.590 --> 03:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
because they're misinformed or just
 
03:32:08.389 --> 03:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
because they want to kill something and
 
03:32:10.469 --> 03:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
worst of all sometimes just because they
 
03:32:13.150 --> 03:32:13.160 align:start position:0%
hate them killing contests are one of
 
03:32:15.429 --> 03:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
the worst symptoms of a greater disease
 
03:32:17.510 --> 03:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
a wrong headed hateful attitude towards
 
03:32:19.990 --> 03:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
carnivores especially coyotes and an
 
03:32:22.429 --> 03:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
unwillingness to extend to them the same
 
03:32:24.990 --> 03:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
respect and care state agencies afford
 
03:32:27.349 --> 03:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
other species like white tailed deer it
 
03:32:28.990 --> 03:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
would be a long- awaited step in the
 
03:32:30.630 --> 03:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
right direction to prohibit killing
 
03:32:32.469 --> 03:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
contest and Grant our state's essential
 
03:32:34.670 --> 03:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
Predators a little more respect thank
 
03:32:36.030 --> 03:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
you so much for
 
03:32:38.790 --> 03:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
listening thank you for your time are
 
03:32:40.469 --> 03:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
there any
 
03:32:42.590 --> 03:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
03:32:48.910 --> 03:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:55.990 --> 03:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:58.710 --> 03:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
Switzer uh Mr chairman members of the
 
03:33:00.750 --> 03:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
committee my name's Bob Switzer I'm from
 
03:33:03.670 --> 03:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
Sullivan New Hampshire I find it hard to
 
03:33:06.750 --> 03:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
believe that in this day and age we have
 
03:33:09.429 --> 03:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
leg we have to we need legislation to
 
03:33:10.950 --> 03:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
prevent the want and destruction of
 
03:33:14.349 --> 03:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
wildlife because of a sporting event
 
03:33:16.429 --> 03:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
what kind of message does this end when
 
03:33:18.030 --> 03:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire supports
 
03:33:20.590 --> 03:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
killing contests how does this reflect
 
03:33:22.429 --> 03:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
on the rest of the Hunting
 
03:33:24.550 --> 03:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
Community this reminds me of the
 
03:33:27.269 --> 03:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
slaughter of bison in the 19th century
 
03:33:29.189 --> 03:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
when tens of thousands of them were
 
03:33:32.349 --> 03:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
killed from trains on the Prairie I
 
03:33:34.030 --> 03:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
would hope that we might have learned a
 
03:33:36.630 --> 03:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
lesson from this but apparently some
 
03:33:40.070 --> 03:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
members of our society have not has
 
03:33:41.830 --> 03:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
anyone determined the purpose of a
 
03:33:45.830 --> 03:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
killing contest who benefits from it how
 
03:33:48.990 --> 03:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
does it improve our society I personally
 
03:33:50.950 --> 03:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
think killing contest condone some of
 
03:33:52.790 --> 03:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
the most disgusting and detestable
 
03:33:56.189 --> 03:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
behavior in our society this is nothing
 
03:33:59.150 --> 03:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
more than thrill killing it takes a
 
03:34:01.269 --> 03:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
troubled individual to participate in
 
03:34:04.349 --> 03:34:04.359 align:start position:0%
this kind of activity when a child kills
 
03:34:07.550 --> 03:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
an animal for fun we fear Mental
 
03:34:09.910 --> 03:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
Illness but when an adult with the
 
03:34:12.349 --> 03:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
capacity to reason kills multiple
 
03:34:16.750 --> 03:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
animals for fun we call it a sport
 
03:34:19.030 --> 03:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
I've seen the photos of piles of dead
 
03:34:21.309 --> 03:34:21.319 align:start position:0%
coyotes with grinning a grinning
 
03:34:23.710 --> 03:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
individual proudly looking into the
 
03:34:26.070 --> 03:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
camera these dead coyotes are not
 
03:34:30.070 --> 03:34:30.080 align:start position:0%

03:34:32.870 --> 03:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
how many of these animals had Young Who
 
03:34:34.910 --> 03:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
now have to fend for themselves and
 
03:34:38.429 --> 03:34:38.439 align:start position:0%
possibly die from starvation predation
 
03:34:42.389 --> 03:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
or exposure all as a result of a killer
 
03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
who doesn't care about
 
03:34:46.990 --> 03:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
wildlife speaking specifically about
 
03:34:49.030 --> 03:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
coyote killing contests The Vermont fish
 
03:34:52.189 --> 03:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
and wildlife department has said coyote
 
03:34:53.910 --> 03:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
killing contests are not only
 
03:34:56.429 --> 03:34:56.439 align:start position:0%
ineffective at controlling coyote
 
03:34:58.469 --> 03:34:58.479 align:start position:0%
populations but these kinds of
 
03:35:01.030 --> 03:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
competitive coyote hunts are raising
 
03:35:03.389 --> 03:35:03.399 align:start position:0%
concerns on the part of the public and
 
03:35:05.630 --> 03:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
could possibly jeopardize the future of
 
03:35:08.670 --> 03:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
hunting and affect access to private
 
03:35:12.550 --> 03:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
lands for all Hunters Vermont as has
 
03:35:15.189 --> 03:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
been said by other testimony Vermont ban
 
03:35:17.910 --> 03:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
coyote contest in 2018 and Manchester
 
03:35:20.990 --> 03:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
banned uh man Massachusetts banned in
 
03:35:23.710 --> 03:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
2019 and nationally there are 10 states
 
03:35:25.110 --> 03:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
that have banned them and I think it's
 
03:35:27.670 --> 03:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
time that New Hampshire joined the rest
 
03:35:30.550 --> 03:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
of those States in conclusion I ask that
 
03:35:32.110 --> 03:35:32.120 align:start position:0%
you vote to move this bill out of
 
03:35:34.389 --> 03:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
committee and send it to the full house
 
03:35:38.389 --> 03:35:38.399 align:start position:0%
for a vote thank you for your time thank
 
03:35:39.790 --> 03:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
you are there any
 
03:35:41.950 --> 03:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
03:35:46.710 --> 03:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:00.150 --> 03:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:02.389 --> 03:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
Snider good afternoon my name is
 
03:36:04.630 --> 03:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
Christina Snider I'm from Chester New
 
03:36:07.030 --> 03:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you for listening to my
 
03:36:10.870 --> 03:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
testimony today I will say that I am in
 
03:36:14.030 --> 03:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
support of this bill I do support a
 
03:36:16.630 --> 03:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
banon killing contest and there are
 
03:36:18.590 --> 03:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
photos of a New Hampshire killing
 
03:36:20.550 --> 03:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
contest that are currently still public
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
on Facebook if anybody wants to see them
 
03:36:25.150 --> 03:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
so they they they are they are there for
 
03:36:27.269 --> 03:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but I want to touch on W
 
03:36:28.750 --> 03:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
and waste a little
 
03:36:32.790 --> 03:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
bit um I want to talk about crows now a
 
03:36:35.349 --> 03:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
lot of farmers uh do not like crows and
 
03:36:37.269 --> 03:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
they kill a lot of crows because they
 
03:36:38.590 --> 03:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
affect their
 
03:36:41.469 --> 03:36:41.479 align:start position:0%
corn if this bill passes that would
 
03:36:43.469 --> 03:36:43.479 align:start position:0%
still be happening they have every right
 
03:36:45.910 --> 03:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
to protect their property and their
 
03:36:48.910 --> 03:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
livestock and their crops however there
 
03:36:52.070 --> 03:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
is a contingent of hunters that go out
 
03:36:55.349 --> 03:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
and just kill crows just to kill them
 
03:36:57.309 --> 03:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
and I do have a couple quotes from a
 
03:37:00.229 --> 03:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
couple articles and these articles they
 
03:37:02.910 --> 03:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
interviewed a hunter a crow Hunter so
 
03:37:04.870 --> 03:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
this is not an animal activist this is
 
03:37:07.309 --> 03:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
someone who shoots crows is an expert at
 
03:37:09.870 --> 03:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
calling in Crows and shooting them so if
 
03:37:13.030 --> 03:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
I may I'm going to read these two
 
03:37:16.309 --> 03:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
quotes shot crows usually are tossed on
 
03:37:19.229 --> 03:37:19.239 align:start position:0%
manure piles ground into dog food or
 
03:37:22.150 --> 03:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
left for scavengers because most states
 
03:37:24.750 --> 03:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
don't set bag limits for Crows Hunters
 
03:37:27.429 --> 03:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
bragging rights lie in the numbers this
 
03:37:30.070 --> 03:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
is an article from ESPN regarding New
 
03:37:32.150 --> 03:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Crow hunting so this is New
 
03:37:35.150 --> 03:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's another quote I mean
 
03:37:37.309 --> 03:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
I'm a Hunter I'm a fisherman and I have
 
03:37:39.550 --> 03:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
no problem with hunting but Crow hunting
 
03:37:42.349 --> 03:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
is very different crows are killed and
 
03:37:44.870 --> 03:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
they're just left or piled up sometimes
 
03:37:46.750 --> 03:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
it's not that typical hunting where
 
03:37:48.910 --> 03:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
you're out to gather a resource which
 
03:37:51.269 --> 03:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
you can enjoy and eat although I'll tell
 
03:37:53.990 --> 03:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
you they taste great so you can eat
 
03:37:56.670 --> 03:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
these crows but apparently this is a
 
03:37:58.910 --> 03:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
crow Hunter and he's calling out a
 
03:38:00.910 --> 03:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
contingent of The Hunting Community that
 
03:38:03.750 --> 03:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
just piles up crows tosses them and
 
03:38:06.429 --> 03:38:06.439 align:start position:0%
they're done that's unacceptable and I
 
03:38:09.710 --> 03:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill would address
 
03:38:13.110 --> 03:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
that it should address that that is
 
03:38:16.389 --> 03:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
clearly an example of killing just for
 
03:38:18.750 --> 03:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
the sake of killing and I don't think in
 
03:38:21.189 --> 03:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
2025 that that should be happening not
 
03:38:23.229 --> 03:38:23.239 align:start position:0%
in my state of New Hampshire and that's
 
03:38:25.550 --> 03:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
all I have to say thank you thank you
 
03:38:27.349 --> 03:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
03:38:29.389 --> 03:38:29.399 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
03:38:29.399 --> 03:38:32.870 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
testimony

03:38:32.870 --> 03:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:50.469 --> 03:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:52.830 --> 03:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
03:38:56.590 --> 03:38:56.600 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Ray green I
 
03:38:59.229 --> 03:38:59.239 align:start position:0%
live in Milford New Hampshire but I am
 
03:39:02.469 --> 03:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
also the fishing
 
03:39:05.309 --> 03:39:05.319 align:start position:0%
game um chairman of the fishing Game
 
03:39:08.830 --> 03:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
Commission and I am the chairman I am
 
03:39:11.750 --> 03:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioner for hillsbro
 
03:39:14.349 --> 03:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
County originally when this bill came
 
03:39:16.630 --> 03:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
out one thing that I want to make clear
 
03:39:19.229 --> 03:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
on the commission is the commission
 
03:39:23.189 --> 03:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
voted opposed to this bill the reason
 
03:39:25.389 --> 03:39:25.399 align:start position:0%
why we voted opposed to this bill is
 
03:39:27.910 --> 03:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
that we felt this bill should have been
 
03:39:30.429 --> 03:39:30.439 align:start position:0%
split into two
 
03:39:32.910 --> 03:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
bills it's two different
 
03:39:36.429 --> 03:39:36.439 align:start position:0%
subjects you have want and waste and you
 
03:39:39.429 --> 03:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
also have killing contests the
 
03:39:43.830 --> 03:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
commission is not against want and waste
 
03:39:46.110 --> 03:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know anybody to want especially
 
03:39:47.790 --> 03:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
Sportsmen that want to go out and waste
 
03:39:50.590 --> 03:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
an animal just for the sake of killing
 
03:39:55.870 --> 03:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:58.950 --> 03:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
it so we're in favor of want and waste
 
03:40:01.790 --> 03:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
we don't we want want and waste in there
 
03:40:04.790 --> 03:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
that people aren't wasting it what we're
 
03:40:07.150 --> 03:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
against is that originally when the bill
 
03:40:08.950 --> 03:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
started was about
 
03:40:12.150 --> 03:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
the the wildlife killing
 
03:40:14.590 --> 03:40:14.600 align:start position:0%
contests the way the original Bill
 
03:40:17.830 --> 03:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
started you and I could not even have a
 
03:40:20.710 --> 03:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
bet if we were going to go out on say
 
03:40:24.070 --> 03:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving and shoot a turkey and
 
03:40:26.469 --> 03:40:26.479 align:start position:0%
whoever gets the biggest turkey wins the
 
03:40:30.309 --> 03:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
other one I use the example you'll serve
 
03:40:32.830 --> 03:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
dinner because the original bill it said
 
03:40:35.630 --> 03:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
it couldn't be with two people or more
 
03:40:38.710 --> 03:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
didn't Define it then it got defined
 
03:40:42.030 --> 03:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
down even more where it has brought the
 
03:40:44.830 --> 03:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
bill down quite a bit but the one of the
 
03:40:47.990 --> 03:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I feel and what
 
03:40:51.030 --> 03:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
the commission is about is
 
03:40:54.110 --> 03:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
that the bill is now saying no later
 
03:40:56.469 --> 03:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
than January 1st the executive director
 
03:41:00.110 --> 03:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
shall adopt in pursuant to RSA you're
 
03:41:04.510 --> 03:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
making it just one person is making that
 
03:41:08.229 --> 03:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
decision what we find out about that is
 
03:41:11.309 --> 03:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
we have a fantastic director in place
 
03:41:14.630 --> 03:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
right now but what happens if he is down
 
03:41:17.950 --> 03:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
the road we have a director in place
 
03:41:20.389 --> 03:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
that they believe and go out and have a
 
03:41:22.670 --> 03:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
hunting contest on everything that moves
 
03:41:25.990 --> 03:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
out there or if you had a director that
 
03:41:28.469 --> 03:41:28.479 align:start position:0%
came in place and says I don't
 
03:41:31.910 --> 03:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
believe that this should be any type of
 
03:41:34.950 --> 03:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
a hunting contest you're leaving it down
 
03:41:39.189 --> 03:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
to one person making the decision for
 
03:41:42.229 --> 03:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
how many people that live in the state
 
03:41:45.229 --> 03:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
that I believe the bill should read with
 
03:41:47.349 --> 03:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
with the executive director along with
 
03:41:47.359 --> 03:41:48.349 align:start position:0%
with the executive director along with
the

03:41:48.349 --> 03:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:41:51.389 --> 03:41:51.399 align:start position:0%
approval of the fishing Game Commission
 
03:41:53.510 --> 03:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's the fishing game Commissioners that
 
03:41:57.790 --> 03:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
are out there with the public hearing
 
03:42:00.750 --> 03:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
the public meeting with the
 
03:42:03.630 --> 03:42:03.640 align:start position:0%
public and dealing with the
 
03:42:06.149 --> 03:42:06.159 align:start position:0%
wildlife and that's all I'm going to
 
03:42:08.269 --> 03:42:08.279 align:start position:0%
have to say the other just sorry there
 
03:42:11.229 --> 03:42:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:14.349 --> 03:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
more this bill isn't isn't about a
 
03:42:14.359 --> 03:42:16.910 align:start position:0%
more this bill isn't isn't about a
resource

03:42:16.910 --> 03:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
resource
 
03:42:19.950 --> 03:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't affect our resource this bill
 
03:42:22.389 --> 03:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
is a social
 
03:42:25.510 --> 03:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
issue you have people that don't believe
 
03:42:28.149 --> 03:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
oh we shouldn't have a hunting contest
 
03:42:30.990 --> 03:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have this that I believe
 
03:42:33.710 --> 03:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
that is just it's not it's not
 
03:42:37.950 --> 03:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
about a resource I believe it's it's a
 
03:42:40.630 --> 03:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
social issue it's kind of one of those
 
03:42:42.389 --> 03:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
it's a feel-good
 
03:42:46.750 --> 03:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
bill but what does it really affect
 
03:42:48.630 --> 03:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
and that's all I have Mr chair thank you
 
03:42:52.189 --> 03:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey so um the
 
03:42:54.070 --> 03:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
amendment I believe leades it up to the
 
03:42:58.469 --> 03:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
ru making process which is um certainly
 
03:43:01.030 --> 03:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
not one person because when you
 
03:43:01.040 --> 03:43:02.830 align:start position:0%
not one person because when you
do

03:43:02.830 --> 03:43:02.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:43:06.070 --> 03:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
correct um when you do rules you have
 
03:43:08.189 --> 03:43:08.199 align:start position:0%
hearings throughout the whole state and
 
03:43:10.670 --> 03:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
then bring that information back am am I
 
03:43:12.389 --> 03:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
incorrect In how that rule making
 
03:43:14.670 --> 03:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
process works and in the ru making
 
03:43:17.429 --> 03:43:17.439 align:start position:0%
process it also depends what the rule is
 
03:43:20.389 --> 03:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
on on whether or not the commission has
 
03:43:23.630 --> 03:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
Authority or not it's not saying hey the
 
03:43:25.910 --> 03:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
commission has full Authority on all rul
 
03:43:28.670 --> 03:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
making it comes down
 
03:43:31.510 --> 03:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
into the the numerous amounts of
 
03:43:33.750 --> 03:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
sections that the commission does have
 
03:43:37.269 --> 03:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
Authority or doesn't have authority what
 
03:43:40.670 --> 03:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
you're doing here is you're not giv the
 
03:43:43.269 --> 03:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
commission the authority to say what
 
03:43:46.149 --> 03:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
animals should be on that list
 
03:43:50.189 --> 03:43:50.199 align:start position:0%
of of a contest or not and the other
 
03:43:53.429 --> 03:43:53.439 align:start position:0%
thing is defining the
 
03:43:56.389 --> 03:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
animal so I'm still follow up thank you
 
03:43:56.399 --> 03:43:57.309 align:start position:0%
animal so I'm still follow up thank you
I'm

03:43:57.309 --> 03:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
03:43:59.950 --> 03:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm still confused but on a higher
 
03:43:59.960 --> 03:44:04.030 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm still confused but on a higher
level

03:44:04.030 --> 03:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:05.950 --> 03:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
so if
 
03:44:08.229 --> 03:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
we pass such an
 
03:44:13.110 --> 03:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
amendment and allow this um decision to
 
03:44:17.469 --> 03:44:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:19.630 --> 03:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
process does
 
03:44:19.640 --> 03:44:21.590 align:start position:0%
process does
that

03:44:21.590 --> 03:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:44:25.550 --> 03:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
totally um totally bar the commission
 
03:44:29.070 --> 03:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
from having any input into that Ru
 
03:44:31.590 --> 03:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
making process I I'm still confused
 
03:44:33.630 --> 03:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
about that process I guess well if you
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
if you pass this as a law the law will
 
03:44:41.469 --> 03:44:41.479 align:start position:0%
state that the executive director shall
 
03:44:43.710 --> 03:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
adopt the
 
03:44:46.349 --> 03:44:46.359 align:start position:0%
rules does doesn't say anything about
 
03:44:52.269 --> 03:44:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:54.429 --> 03:44:54.439 align:start position:0%
commission any further
 
03:44:57.189 --> 03:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:44:59.550 --> 03:44:59.560 align:start position:0%

asked a couple times haven't really got
 
03:45:05.110 --> 03:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
an answer you might know the answer to
 
03:45:07.269 --> 03:45:07.279 align:start position:0%
this are there any hunting contests in
 
03:45:09.349 --> 03:45:09.359 align:start position:0%

03:45:15.070 --> 03:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
of I am not aware of any thank you
 
03:45:16.389 --> 03:45:16.399 align:start position:0%
any further
 
03:45:18.429 --> 03:45:18.439 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
03:45:23.189 --> 03:45:23.199 align:start position:0%

03:45:37.630 --> 03:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
sir good afternoon Mr chairman members
 
03:45:39.670 --> 03:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm Kurt aronberg I'm
 
03:45:41.670 --> 03:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire state director of the
 
03:45:47.070 --> 03:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:51.110 --> 03:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
um uh so I live in
 
03:45:55.990 --> 03:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and we are in full support
 
03:45:57.910 --> 03:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
the Humane Society of the United States
 
03:46:00.389 --> 03:46:00.399 align:start position:0%
is in full support of a ban on Wildlife
 
03:46:03.389 --> 03:46:03.399 align:start position:0%
killing contest in the state and we do
 
03:46:06.750 --> 03:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:10.550 --> 03:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
589 uh as originally introduced we would
 
03:46:12.830 --> 03:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
have liked to have
 
03:46:16.389 --> 03:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
seen uh some improvements
 
03:46:18.870 --> 03:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
that ensure that the species that are
 
03:46:22.510 --> 03:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
most commonly targeted such as coyotes
 
03:46:25.830 --> 03:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
Etc are more explicitly included in the
 
03:46:28.429 --> 03:46:28.439 align:start position:0%
language and second we ask that there
 
03:46:32.469 --> 03:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
are not loopholes in and any exemptions
 
03:46:35.030 --> 03:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
that might allow some killing contests
 
03:46:35.040 --> 03:46:36.189 align:start position:0%
that might allow some killing contests
to

03:46:36.189 --> 03:46:36.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:46:40.630 --> 03:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
continue um the
 
03:46:46.790 --> 03:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
proposal to have the bill
 
03:46:50.950 --> 03:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
ask for and say shall the commission or
 
03:46:52.630 --> 03:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
the director
 
03:46:57.389 --> 03:46:57.399 align:start position:0%
shall um promate
 
03:47:00.710 --> 03:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
rules we're not necessarily comfortable
 
03:47:03.750 --> 03:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
with that because of what it says in the
 
03:47:03.760 --> 03:47:04.750 align:start position:0%
with that because of what it says in the
bill

03:47:04.750 --> 03:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:47:08.469 --> 03:47:08.479 align:start position:0%
is identifying ex
 
03:47:12.269 --> 03:47:12.279 align:start position:0%
exemptions except we're allowed by rules
 
03:47:14.950 --> 03:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh made under paragraph two and they
 
03:47:17.670 --> 03:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
identif identifying exemptions that are
 
03:47:17.680 --> 03:47:18.750 align:start position:0%
identif identifying exemptions that are
not

03:47:18.750 --> 03:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:47:21.550 --> 03:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
specified so it leaves a lot of room
 
03:47:23.550 --> 03:47:23.560 align:start position:0%
that we're not comfortable with but what
 
03:47:26.149 --> 03:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
we are comfortable with is effective
 
03:47:29.229 --> 03:47:29.239 align:start position:0%
language that would ban killing contests
 
03:47:31.830 --> 03:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I would just say
 
03:47:33.630 --> 03:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
and there's been a lot said and I don't
 
03:47:36.149 --> 03:47:36.159 align:start position:0%
want to keep everyone here longer than
 
03:47:37.950 --> 03:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
they need to be I think there's been a
 
03:47:40.510 --> 03:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
lot of good information a lot of good
 
03:47:43.710 --> 03:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
people have testified here today and I
 
03:47:45.670 --> 03:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate all the test testimony we've
 
03:47:48.550 --> 03:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
heard but this measure would not affect
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
in any way the lawful regulated hunting
 
03:47:55.149 --> 03:47:55.159 align:start position:0%
control or management of the wildlife
 
03:47:56.710 --> 03:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
species listed
 
03:47:58.950 --> 03:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
therein nor would it prevent New
 
03:48:01.590 --> 03:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire land over owners or livestock
 
03:48:05.830 --> 03:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
Farmers from lethally removing Predators
 
03:48:08.429 --> 03:48:08.439 align:start position:0%
or animals on their property that are
 
03:48:10.830 --> 03:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
predators it would merely prohibit
 
03:48:14.510 --> 03:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
making a cash and prizes game out of the
 
03:48:17.910 --> 03:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
mass killing of the wildlife that is
 
03:48:21.429 --> 03:48:21.439 align:start position:0%
managed in trust for the benefit of all
 
03:48:24.550 --> 03:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents and I think the
 
03:48:27.469 --> 03:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
question we can put to bed today if we
 
03:48:30.389 --> 03:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
ask the fish and game department are
 
03:48:33.110 --> 03:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
there contests like this going on in New
 
03:48:36.870 --> 03:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you'll get the answer um from
 
03:48:40.110 --> 03:48:40.120 align:start position:0%
the source that knows and uh I think you
 
03:48:42.750 --> 03:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
should find that out today and I
 
03:48:45.510 --> 03:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh your time I've cut my
 
03:48:48.990 --> 03:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
testimony way down I app I uh hope you
 
03:48:51.030 --> 03:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate that Mr chairman for time's
 
03:48:54.870 --> 03:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
sake I'm happy to take any
 
03:49:00.110 --> 03:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:02.229 --> 03:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you Mr
 
03:49:04.070 --> 03:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
co-chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:49:07.149 --> 03:49:07.159 align:start position:0%
question are you saying that you like
 
03:49:10.269 --> 03:49:10.279 align:start position:0%
this bill but you want it to be revised
 
03:49:13.349 --> 03:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
so that it speaks more to
 
03:49:15.710 --> 03:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
the some of of the points that you're
 
03:49:19.870 --> 03:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
making about well if the bill Bill's
 
03:49:22.590 --> 03:49:22.600 align:start position:0%
intention is
 
03:49:26.830 --> 03:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
to stop the practice of wildlife killing
 
03:49:29.710 --> 03:49:29.720 align:start position:0%
contests in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:49:31.389 --> 03:49:31.399 align:start position:0%
we believe that the language should be
 
03:49:33.830 --> 03:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
clear about that not only about the
 
03:49:38.510 --> 03:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
species that it protects and covers but
 
03:49:41.750 --> 03:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
also making sure that if it's done
 
03:49:43.630 --> 03:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
through rul making or statute or
 
03:49:46.630 --> 03:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
whatever that it it
 
03:49:50.950 --> 03:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
is Ironclad in that it it it prohibits
 
03:49:53.710 --> 03:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
these contests which as I said are
 
03:49:57.870 --> 03:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
clearly just for cash pleasure prizes um
 
03:49:59.590 --> 03:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's shameful and we shouldn't do it in
 
03:50:02.030 --> 03:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire thank
 
03:50:04.349 --> 03:50:04.359 align:start position:0%

03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
sheep Farmer for 18 years um I have
 
03:50:54.550 --> 03:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
begun I began 40 years ago with wolf
 
03:50:57.389 --> 03:50:57.399 align:start position:0%
work and when I moved East realized what
 
03:50:59.469 --> 03:50:59.479 align:start position:0%
we had here with the Eastern coyote was
 
03:51:01.870 --> 03:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
a much more interesting animal and so
 
03:51:05.630 --> 03:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
for the last 30 years I have devoted my
 
03:51:08.189 --> 03:51:08.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of my life to understanding this
 
03:51:10.910 --> 03:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
animal to keeping this animal off of my

sheep um the animal has taught me a
 
03:51:16.750 --> 03:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
great deal about how to be a diligent
 
03:51:20.269 --> 03:51:20.279 align:start position:0%
farmer etc etc and I'm telling you this
 
03:51:23.990 --> 03:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
by way of saying that I approach this
 
03:51:26.149 --> 03:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
pragmatically um I have a science
 
03:51:29.469 --> 03:51:29.479 align:start position:0%
background and so I add that into the
 
03:51:33.189 --> 03:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
mix um for 40 years I have traveled all
 
03:51:35.429 --> 03:51:35.439 align:start position:0%
over New England educating people
 
03:51:37.830 --> 03:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
primarily on Eastern coyotes but now
 
03:51:40.389 --> 03:51:40.399 align:start position:0%
also Eastern wolves since we know that
 
03:51:42.630 --> 03:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
they are part of the mix out
 
03:51:45.870 --> 03:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
there today we're talking about a bill
 
03:51:48.269 --> 03:51:48.279 align:start position:0%
to ban Wildlife killing contests and I
 
03:51:51.189 --> 03:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
think that most of you are probably
 
03:51:53.269 --> 03:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
saturated with the facts that have
 
03:51:55.990 --> 03:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
already been presented so I just want to
 
03:52:00.389 --> 03:52:00.399 align:start position:0%
make a couple of points here um and a
 
03:52:02.710 --> 03:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
couple of them in response to what Mr
 
03:52:06.590 --> 03:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
Green was claiming um there were last
 
03:52:08.950 --> 03:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
minute amendments to this bill and I
 
03:52:11.710 --> 03:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
think all of you have a copy of those
 
03:52:15.750 --> 03:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
amendments which allows um requires the
 
03:52:18.830 --> 03:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
approval of the Commission in Ru making
 
03:52:21.070 --> 03:52:21.080 align:start position:0%
so the commission of course would be
 
03:52:23.309 --> 03:52:23.319 align:start position:0%
involved in this the fact that the
 
03:52:23.319 --> 03:52:24.550 align:start position:0%
involved in this the fact that the
executive

03:52:24.550 --> 03:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
executive
 
03:52:27.269 --> 03:52:27.279 align:start position:0%
director would have the charge once the
 
03:52:30.750 --> 03:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
bill is in place I'm imagining that
 
03:52:32.670 --> 03:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
other executive directors that might
 
03:52:36.910 --> 03:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
follow her would have to um oblige the
 
03:52:40.110 --> 03:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
law which would be that the The Killing
 
03:52:41.670 --> 03:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
contests have been
 
03:52:44.189 --> 03:52:44.199 align:start position:0%
banned another thing and which I find
 
03:52:44.199 --> 03:52:45.110 align:start position:0%
banned another thing and which I find
very

03:52:45.110 --> 03:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:52:47.429 --> 03:52:47.439 align:start position:0%
curious I know that there's killing
 
03:52:50.110 --> 03:52:50.120 align:start position:0%
contests out there maybe I travel with
 
03:52:53.830 --> 03:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
the wrong crowd but um I know that there
 
03:52:57.630 --> 03:52:57.640 align:start position:0%
have been two in the very recent past I
 
03:53:00.590 --> 03:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
don't know about this year uh one near
 
03:53:03.469 --> 03:53:03.479 align:start position:0%
Jaffrey the other in Rochester I've
 
03:53:06.950 --> 03:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
heard from some people who know that
 
03:53:09.870 --> 03:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
there have also been contests up North
 
03:53:13.550 --> 03:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
so they're happening and it's surprising
 
03:53:15.950 --> 03:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
to me that
 
03:53:18.990 --> 03:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
that more people aren't aware um it's
 
03:53:21.950 --> 03:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
not all it's also not surprising to me
 
03:53:23.830 --> 03:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
that some of the contests that had been
 
03:53:25.710 --> 03:53:25.720 align:start position:0%
occurring have
 
03:53:28.229 --> 03:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
gone have been occurring without a lot
 
03:53:31.590 --> 03:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
of advertising let's put it that way um
 
03:53:34.830 --> 03:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
the public is aware because of me and
 
03:53:38.149 --> 03:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
other groups who have been talking about
 
03:53:41.670 --> 03:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
the ludicrous nature of holding a
 
03:53:45.030 --> 03:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
contest that actually encourages people
 
03:53:47.389 --> 03:53:47.399 align:start position:0%
to kill the most animals that they can
 
03:53:50.910 --> 03:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
kill and if you would just look at the
 
03:53:53.830 --> 03:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that is before you my
 
03:53:57.309 --> 03:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
testimony the front page looks like
 
03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
this it has a little chart on the
 
03:54:05.590 --> 03:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:09.469 --> 03:54:09.479 align:start position:0%
chart if you can take a look at it the
 
03:54:13.189 --> 03:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
chart indicates from fishing and game
 
03:54:16.990 --> 03:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
data that that red fox gray fox and
 
03:54:21.349 --> 03:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
Fisher are in trouble in our
 
03:54:23.950 --> 03:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
state they are in
 
03:54:27.670 --> 03:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
trouble why they're in trouble in part
 
03:54:31.510 --> 03:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
because of hunting in part because of
 
03:54:34.710 --> 03:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
rodenticides in part because of habitat
 
03:54:36.950 --> 03:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
change these
 
03:54:39.229 --> 03:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
predators are a little bit more
 
03:54:42.870 --> 03:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
specialized than prey species are and so
 
03:54:48.469 --> 03:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
um when we as a state allow or turn our
 
03:54:52.950 --> 03:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
eye away from contests that do this it
 
03:54:55.189 --> 03:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
is it amounts to
 
03:54:58.830 --> 03:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
indiscriminate killing of predator
 
03:55:01.429 --> 03:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
species and somebody wanted to know
 
03:55:06.469 --> 03:55:06.479 align:start position:0%
which species red fox gray fox coyote
 
03:55:06.479 --> 03:55:09.790 align:start position:0%
which species red fox gray fox coyote
Fisher

03:55:09.790 --> 03:55:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:14.309 --> 03:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
raccoon just killed and stacked up way
 
03:55:16.950 --> 03:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
made measured and
 
03:55:19.710 --> 03:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
discarded I also want to say Mr Green
 
03:55:21.790 --> 03:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
made the point about separating want and
 
03:55:24.990 --> 03:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
waste from killing contests killing
 
03:55:27.030 --> 03:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
contests generate want and
 
03:55:30.349 --> 03:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
waste they are
 
03:55:34.030 --> 03:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
quintessentially united together
 
03:55:38.389 --> 03:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
so in our view and and hopefully the
 
03:55:42.830 --> 03:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
folks at fishing game agree or might see
 
03:55:45.710 --> 03:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
that this bill the way that it's written
 
03:55:48.750 --> 03:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be written in exactly this way
 
03:55:51.670 --> 03:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
so that we understand what want and
 
03:55:54.389 --> 03:55:54.399 align:start position:0%
waste is and that want and waste results
 
03:55:58.510 --> 03:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
from indiscriminate killing of wild
 
03:56:00.990 --> 03:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
animals the last thing I'm going to say
 
03:56:02.590 --> 03:56:02.600 align:start position:0%
oh no sorry the last thing I'm going to
 
03:56:05.590 --> 03:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
say is that there's a principle involved
 
03:56:08.429 --> 03:56:08.439 align:start position:0%
here the principle of respecting the
 
03:56:11.189 --> 03:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
wildlife that we have and several people
 
03:56:13.309 --> 03:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
have talked about this I think it's
 
03:56:15.670 --> 03:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
really important I don't regard it as a
 
03:56:19.309 --> 03:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
social issue I regard it very much as a
 
03:56:22.870 --> 03:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
wildlife um an issue that is affecting
 
03:56:27.189 --> 03:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
our wildlife and because so many tens of
 
03:56:29.710 --> 03:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
thousands of tourists come to our state
 
03:56:33.030 --> 03:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
now and spend their money to see our
 
03:56:35.229 --> 03:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
wildlife and to see the natural beauty
 
03:56:38.510 --> 03:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
of the place why not care for these
 
03:56:41.510 --> 03:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
animals in this very simple way it's
 
03:56:44.389 --> 03:56:44.399 align:start position:0%
certainly not a bill about hunting we we
 
03:56:47.750 --> 03:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
are as a coalition oh so I founded the
 
03:56:49.870 --> 03:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire wildlife Coalition along
 
03:56:52.910 --> 03:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
with John harrian and our view was that
 
03:56:55.550 --> 03:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
protector that Predators needed
 
03:56:58.349 --> 03:56:58.359 align:start position:0%
protection um for a variety of reasons
 
03:57:01.030 --> 03:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
and anyway that's basically what I
 
03:57:02.750 --> 03:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to say to you I hope that you
 
03:57:05.429 --> 03:57:05.439 align:start position:0%
will support this bill it's a good bill
 
03:57:08.269 --> 03:57:08.279 align:start position:0%
it's about time 10 other states have
 
03:57:10.349 --> 03:57:10.359 align:start position:0%
done it I know how independent New
 
03:57:12.990 --> 03:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is but the tide is turning
 
03:57:16.309 --> 03:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:19.149 --> 03:57:19.159 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any questions
 
03:57:20.469 --> 03:57:20.479 align:start position:0%
representative love
 
03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chair could could you
 
03:57:26.070 --> 03:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
just explain on your graph what we're
 
03:57:29.750 --> 03:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
talking about in 2024 with regard to Red
 
03:57:32.990 --> 03:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
Fox gray fox um what what does that
 
03:57:34.830 --> 03:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
little bullet tell us in terms of the
 
03:57:38.910 --> 03:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
trend well you can see numerically oh I
 
03:57:41.590 --> 03:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
or vaguely or you're the scientist you
 
03:57:44.269 --> 03:57:44.279 align:start position:0%
tell us what we have means could
 
03:57:47.590 --> 03:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
question on the Coalition we have Wen
 
03:57:50.349 --> 03:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
Bosworth who's our statistician and what
 
03:57:53.750 --> 03:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
he did was he took the um the record the
 
03:57:56.750 --> 03:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
Trapper records from fishing game over a
 
03:57:59.710 --> 03:57:59.720 align:start position:0%
long period of time to see whether these
 
03:58:04.389 --> 03:58:04.399 align:start position:0%
animals are in a stable State and what
 
03:58:06.670 --> 03:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
these bullet points represent is a
 
03:58:10.389 --> 03:58:10.399 align:start position:0%
decline overtime in their
 
03:58:12.990 --> 03:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
population in terms of the actual
 
03:58:15.429 --> 03:58:15.439 align:start position:0%
numbers what's interesting about these
 
03:58:18.309 --> 03:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
numbers and I'm glad you asked is that
 
03:58:20.790 --> 03:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
people are not responsible fishing game
 
03:58:22.950 --> 03:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't hold them responsible for
 
03:58:25.510 --> 03:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
reporting what they've killed so all we
 
03:58:29.030 --> 03:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
know is what Trappers are able to take
 
03:58:32.229 --> 03:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
and so what we're seeing here is is a
 
03:58:34.710 --> 03:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
measure in that
 
03:58:37.070 --> 03:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
way thank you any other questions
 
03:58:37.080 --> 03:58:38.189 align:start position:0%
way thank you any other questions
representative

03:58:38.189 --> 03:58:38.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:58:40.990 --> 03:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
tutor so the the graph the numbers that
 
03:58:43.630 --> 03:58:43.640 align:start position:0%
the graph represents are the numbers of
 
03:58:48.110 --> 03:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
fox is taken by Trappers they yes
 
03:58:51.070 --> 03:58:51.080 align:start position:0%
essentially follow up Mr chair follow up
 
03:58:53.110 --> 03:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
again thank you for taking my question
 
03:58:54.910 --> 03:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
um isn't it also true that we've had a
 
03:58:56.830 --> 03:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
severe reduction in Trappers over the
 
03:59:01.870 --> 03:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
same period yeah it is no well trapping
 
03:59:03.990 --> 03:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
same number of trapping LIC oh same
 
03:59:05.990 --> 03:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
number of trapping licenses I don't same
 
03:59:08.790 --> 03:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:10.950 --> 03:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
Trappers that's a good question for
 
03:59:14.750 --> 03:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
fishing game okay thank you any
 
03:59:17.950 --> 03:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative Durkin thank
 
03:59:19.550 --> 03:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
03:59:23.990 --> 03:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
question uh is is there any way that you
 
03:59:26.870 --> 03:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
could determine that that those numbers
 
03:59:29.070 --> 03:59:29.080 align:start position:0%
are shrinking because of overt trapped
 
03:59:31.550 --> 03:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
hunted or because of
 
03:59:34.910 --> 03:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
losing uh their habitat y I think that's
 
03:59:37.229 --> 03:59:37.239 align:start position:0%
such a good question and it gets to the
 
03:59:40.389 --> 03:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
complexity of the issue there's no
 
03:59:42.630 --> 03:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
there's no one single thing that is
 
03:59:46.349 --> 03:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
impacting wildlife in our our state it's
 
03:59:50.110 --> 03:59:50.120 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of all of it
 
03:59:53.790 --> 03:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
and one could argue and people have
 
03:59:58.510 --> 03:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
argued that killing contests being so
 
04:00:01.030 --> 04:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
indiscriminate provide what they call
 
04:00:01.040 --> 04:00:02.510 align:start position:0%
indiscriminate provide what they call
additive

04:00:02.510 --> 04:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
additive
 
04:00:05.189 --> 04:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
mortality to a situation where these
 
04:00:09.070 --> 04:00:09.080 align:start position:0%
animals are also facing loss of habitat
 
04:00:11.750 --> 04:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
poisoning with rodenticides all of those
 
04:00:15.950 --> 04:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
things are coming into play here
 
04:00:18.389 --> 04:00:18.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not I I'm honestly not avoiding your
 
04:00:20.429 --> 04:00:20.439 align:start position:0%
question it's a great question the
 
04:00:22.269 --> 04:00:22.279 align:start position:0%
answer really is very
 
04:00:26.229 --> 04:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
complex um and I I am not certain that
 
04:00:31.269 --> 04:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
there has been enough research on on on
 
04:00:34.790 --> 04:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
exactly this um more research would be
 
04:00:36.870 --> 04:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
better and finally I think UNH has
 
04:00:40.110 --> 04:00:40.120 align:start position:0%
finally got a guy in Maul Remington that
 
04:00:44.070 --> 04:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
is interested in doing the research
 
04:00:45.429 --> 04:00:45.439 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
04:00:47.550 --> 04:00:47.560 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
04:00:50.189 --> 04:00:50.199 align:start position:0%
time okay thank you very much the chair
 
04:01:03.590 --> 04:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:06.750 --> 04:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
Baker good afternoon I'm Kyle Baker here
 
04:01:08.870 --> 04:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
wath young and patali here I'm behalf of
 
04:01:10.309 --> 04:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Wildlife Federation New
 
04:01:13.309 --> 04:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Wildlife Federation is a nonon
 
04:01:13.319 --> 04:01:14.469 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Wildlife Federation is a nonon
nonprofit

04:01:14.469 --> 04:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
nonprofit
 
04:01:16.149 --> 04:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
um that's here to advocate for Hunting
 
04:01:17.550 --> 04:01:17.560 align:start position:0%
Fishing trapping as well as the
 
04:01:19.269 --> 04:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
conservation of land for increased
 
04:01:21.630 --> 04:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
access to hunt fish and trap um so as
 
04:01:23.389 --> 04:01:23.399 align:start position:0%
the bill is written um we have some
 
04:01:25.189 --> 04:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
concerns with the piece of legislation
 
04:01:27.229 --> 04:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
um similar to Mr Green we believe the
 
04:01:29.630 --> 04:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
issue should be split um if we want to
 
04:01:31.710 --> 04:01:31.720 align:start position:0%
have a discussion about a clear concise
 
04:01:33.510 --> 04:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
and enforcable definition of what want
 
04:01:35.670 --> 04:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
and waste is um I think Sporting
 
04:01:38.349 --> 04:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
Community would be all for that um you
 
04:01:40.030 --> 04:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
know we talked about search and rescue
 
04:01:41.429 --> 04:01:41.439 align:start position:0%
this morning you rarely hear about
 
04:01:42.750 --> 04:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
hunters needing search and rescue
 
04:01:44.510 --> 04:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
services in New Hampshire but when you
 
04:01:46.189 --> 04:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
do it's that hunter that took one more
 
04:01:47.950 --> 04:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
step into the bog to pull the duck out
 
04:01:50.030 --> 04:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
or took a little bit too took a little
 
04:01:52.110 --> 04:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
bit too far of a walk into into a body
 
04:01:55.189 --> 04:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
of water to try to find their deer um
 
04:01:57.710 --> 04:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
Hunters care deeply about reducing W and
 
04:02:00.710 --> 04:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
waste um I do I did just saw this
 
04:02:03.309 --> 04:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
amendment um this afternoon um I think
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
it does make a a small amount of
 
04:02:07.229 --> 04:02:07.239 align:start position:0%
improvement to the bill particularly
 
04:02:08.990 --> 04:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
giving those at the department some Ru
 
04:02:11.110 --> 04:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
making Authority um I do still have a
 
04:02:12.790 --> 04:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of concern with the
 
04:02:14.269 --> 04:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
sort of the broadness of the definition
 
04:02:16.110 --> 04:02:16.120 align:start position:0%
of want and waste and we want to see
 
04:02:17.590 --> 04:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
spend some time with it and see if we
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
can't find uh you know a a more a more
 
04:02:22.710 --> 04:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
concise and more easily enforceable
 
04:02:25.469 --> 04:02:25.479 align:start position:0%
definition um for everyone to follow
 
04:02:27.990 --> 04:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
regarding hunting contests um we feel
 
04:02:30.070 --> 04:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
that if we have a clear definition of
 
04:02:32.229 --> 04:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
what want and waste is um set through
 
04:02:33.910 --> 04:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
the department using using their
 
04:02:36.309 --> 04:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
background um the idea of a killing
 
04:02:38.550 --> 04:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
contest or hunting contest um would be
 
04:02:41.030 --> 04:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
moot um because we would ensure that
 
04:02:42.269 --> 04:02:42.279 align:start position:0%
there would already be laws on the books
 
04:02:43.990 --> 04:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
to to prohibit the want and waste of of
 
04:02:46.510 --> 04:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
animals so um we also have concerns
 
04:02:50.429 --> 04:02:50.439 align:start position:0%
about whether or not um the the amended
 
04:02:51.790 --> 04:02:51.800 align:start position:0%
language here the amendment that we're
 
04:02:53.630 --> 04:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
looking at this afternoon would start to
 
04:02:55.189 --> 04:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
apply to things like fishing deres or
 
04:02:57.269 --> 04:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
buck pools or things that aren't
 
04:02:59.790 --> 04:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily what I think the intentions
 
04:03:02.229 --> 04:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
are of the sponsor um when it comes to
 
04:03:03.830 --> 04:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know contests that involve you know
 
04:03:05.550 --> 04:03:05.560 align:start position:0%
harvesting the highest amount of animals
 
04:03:08.670 --> 04:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
Forces versus the heaviest Buck or the
 
04:03:10.590 --> 04:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
largest trout through the ice or things
 
04:03:12.429 --> 04:03:12.439 align:start position:0%
along those lines so um we think the
 
04:03:14.030 --> 04:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
bill needs does need a consider able
 
04:03:16.590 --> 04:03:16.600 align:start position:0%
amount of work um but we're happy to um
 
04:03:18.790 --> 04:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
provide input as the process
 
04:03:21.990 --> 04:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
continues thank you any questions
 
04:03:22.000 --> 04:03:23.670 align:start position:0%
continues thank you any questions
representative

04:03:23.670 --> 04:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:03:25.910 --> 04:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
Harvey thank thank you Mr chair thank
 
04:03:27.750 --> 04:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr Baker
 
04:03:30.189 --> 04:03:30.199 align:start position:0%
um please correct me if I'm wrong but
 
04:03:34.030 --> 04:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
didn't we pass the house didn't we pass
 
04:03:36.670 --> 04:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
a um a Prohibition on killing contest
 
04:03:39.510 --> 04:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
last week last week um last session and
 
04:03:41.630 --> 04:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
and this and the body on the other side
 
04:03:44.309 --> 04:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
of the wall did not approve of that
 
04:03:46.149 --> 04:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
no uh I'm not aware of that I believe in
 
04:03:47.950 --> 04:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
2020 there was a very similar piece of
 
04:03:50.469 --> 04:03:50.479 align:start position:0%
legislation to this um and it did work
 
04:03:51.990 --> 04:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
its way through the Senate process I
 
04:03:53.189 --> 04:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
think they had removed the hunting
 
04:03:55.429 --> 04:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
contest piece and created a senator
 
04:03:56.830 --> 04:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
Waters I believe worked on it had a
 
04:03:58.710 --> 04:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
smaller a more concise definition of
 
04:03:59.870 --> 04:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
want and waste and I believe that passed
 
04:04:01.950 --> 04:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
the Senate but then the world shut down
 
04:04:03.229 --> 04:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
and I don't think anything it didn't
 
04:04:05.030 --> 04:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
make it out the other side oh co co
 
04:04:07.590 --> 04:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
happened I'm seeing Mr Bosworth shake
 
04:04:08.990 --> 04:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
his head thank you
 
04:04:12.670 --> 04:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
y any other questions seeing none thank
 
04:04:15.550 --> 04:04:15.560 align:start position:0%
you for your time today
 
04:04:17.950 --> 04:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes the last speaker
 
04:04:17.960 --> 04:04:26.510 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes the last speaker
Colonel

04:04:26.510 --> 04:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:28.870 --> 04:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
Jordan good afternoon Mr chair members
 
04:04:30.469 --> 04:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
of the committee again I'm Kevin Jordan
 
04:04:32.070 --> 04:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
I'm the colonel at New Hampshire fishing
 
04:04:36.269 --> 04:04:36.279 align:start position:0%
game um so I check marked that we're in
 
04:04:39.030 --> 04:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill um but I do have some
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
caveats to that so we worked we tried
 
04:04:44.590 --> 04:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
the director and I tried or did work
 
04:04:47.070 --> 04:04:47.080 align:start position:0%
actually with Welden and Chris shadler
 
04:04:51.189 --> 04:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
and had some success in trying to reach
 
04:04:53.790 --> 04:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
uh their goals without compromising
 
04:04:55.590 --> 04:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
Sportsmen and women that are doing it
 
04:04:57.950 --> 04:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
the right way and they're I can tell you
 
04:05:00.950 --> 04:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
those numbers far out way the numbers
 
04:05:03.389 --> 04:05:03.399 align:start position:0%
you're hearing about today uh and I can
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
say that because I'm the guy that
 
04:05:06.790 --> 04:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
prosecutes those people so we do have a
 
04:05:09.349 --> 04:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
few and and I think New Hampshire has
 
04:05:11.750 --> 04:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
done a real good job I think you your
 
04:05:13.710 --> 04:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
reference to the cruelty bill was a good
 
04:05:15.790 --> 04:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
example Mr chairman when we worked
 
04:05:18.030 --> 04:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
together uh that was a good example of
 
04:05:20.070 --> 04:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
getting together with folks on both
 
04:05:21.870 --> 04:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle and I and frankly
 
04:05:23.229 --> 04:05:23.239 align:start position:0%
listening to the speakers and some of
 
04:05:25.710 --> 04:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
them did a tremendous job I don't think
 
04:05:27.830 --> 04:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
we're that far apart on our beliefs I
 
04:05:29.229 --> 04:05:29.239 align:start position:0%
don't think animals should be wasted
 
04:05:32.030 --> 04:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
either um it makes me very angry that's
 
04:05:33.710 --> 04:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
why I do this job is because I love
 
04:05:35.630 --> 04:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
animals but I also hunt and fish and I
 
04:05:38.030 --> 04:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
love that very much when it's done right
 
04:05:40.469 --> 04:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
I think it's a great thing and I I will
 
04:05:42.630 --> 04:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
disagree that children shouldn't be
 
04:05:43.990 --> 04:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
involved I think we should should go out
 
04:05:45.550 --> 04:05:45.560 align:start position:0%
of our way to make sure the children are
 
04:05:48.070 --> 04:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
involved because I think it's a safer
 
04:05:49.750 --> 04:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
environment than what a lot of kids are
 
04:05:52.550 --> 04:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
exposed to today so but we can debate
 
04:05:55.070 --> 04:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
that on a different day we did talk to
 
04:05:57.550 --> 04:05:57.560 align:start position:0%
Chris shayler and and Welden and we were
 
04:06:00.070 --> 04:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about Buck con deer contest
 
04:06:01.870 --> 04:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
because deer contests don't really
 
04:06:03.990 --> 04:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
matter people are still going to take
 
04:06:06.110 --> 04:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
deer they're going to hunt deer and and
 
04:06:09.710 --> 04:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh Harvest them um and businesses there
 
04:06:12.309 --> 04:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
are a lot of deer pools across the state
 
04:06:14.990 --> 04:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
businesses use it to generate business
 
04:06:17.110 --> 04:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
um whether we have those contests or not
 
04:06:18.670 --> 04:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
people are still going to harvest deer
 
04:06:20.189 --> 04:06:20.199 align:start position:0%
and you can choose whether or not you
 
04:06:22.349 --> 04:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
ever want to participate in it um we
 
04:06:24.030 --> 04:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
were concerned about the rotary fishing
 
04:06:25.790 --> 04:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
derby and other derbies that have a
 
04:06:27.870 --> 04:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
great impact on the local economy and
 
04:06:30.269 --> 04:06:30.279 align:start position:0%
bring families and and if you didn't go
 
04:06:31.910 --> 04:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
to that Derby this year it was kind of
 
04:06:33.750 --> 04:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
refreshing to see the family groups out
 
04:06:35.110 --> 04:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
there the kids out there playing on
 
04:06:37.710 --> 04:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
sleds and and the fathers fishing it was
 
04:06:39.630 --> 04:06:39.640 align:start position:0%
kind of nice again I think personally
 
04:06:42.510 --> 04:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
it's something Society needs more of um
 
04:06:44.070 --> 04:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
and so anytime we can promote that
 
04:06:46.389 --> 04:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
that's good and they were very open to
 
04:06:48.349 --> 04:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
that discussion that that is not what
 
04:06:52.349 --> 04:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
their intent was in my opinion um and so
 
04:06:54.750 --> 04:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
we worked pretty hard with 11
 
04:06:57.429 --> 04:06:57.439 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to try and and get 11
 
04:07:00.590 --> 04:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioners on board uh to try and
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
meet as many of the goals as we could as
 
04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor and the folks that
 
04:07:06.189 --> 04:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
support this bill and not interfere with
 
04:07:09.189 --> 04:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
hunting and so that took a while
 
04:07:11.990 --> 04:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
including up until uh as late as this
 
04:07:15.550 --> 04:07:15.560 align:start position:0%
morning I typed a um a suggested
 
04:07:17.429 --> 04:07:17.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment it's not an amendment it's a
 
04:07:19.510 --> 04:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion and that's I think was
 
04:07:21.070 --> 04:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
delivered to the clerk and has red
 
04:07:23.110 --> 04:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
language in it and basically the
 
04:07:25.750 --> 04:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that we started with today has
 
04:07:27.229 --> 04:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
several faults to it it will be
 
04:07:29.109 --> 04:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
unenforceable on a couple of different
 
04:07:30.830 --> 04:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
fronts and I want to make sure
 
04:07:32.269 --> 04:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
everyone's aware of that and that was
 
04:07:33.710 --> 04:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
the reason that we submitted this
 
04:07:36.750 --> 04:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
amendment so first off um and I think my
 
04:07:40.030 --> 04:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
director actually did this uh by mistake
 
04:07:42.269 --> 04:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
but under want and waste under line five
 
04:07:43.950 --> 04:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
if you look she says the Act of
 
04:07:46.109 --> 04:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
intentionally knowingly recklessly or
 
04:07:48.229 --> 04:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
with criminal negligence so what she's
 
04:07:50.229 --> 04:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
trying to describe there a criminal
 
04:07:53.389 --> 04:07:53.399 align:start position:0%
culpable mental States uh intentionally
 
04:07:55.469 --> 04:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
is not a a culpable mental state in the
 
04:07:56.510 --> 04:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
state of no Hampshire it's not
 
04:07:59.750 --> 04:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
recognized not defined so it can't exist
 
04:08:02.830 --> 04:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
in a law you can't use it um and we
 
04:08:05.149 --> 04:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't use culpable mental States in a
 
04:08:07.469 --> 04:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
violation level offense it puts the
 
04:08:09.830 --> 04:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
level of proof much higher and
 
04:08:12.670 --> 04:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
unnecessary so the one that I crafted I
 
04:08:14.950 --> 04:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
basically eliminated that by replacing
 
04:08:16.950 --> 04:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
the language with the act of wasting a
 
04:08:20.030 --> 04:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
wild animal or a wild bird period that's
 
04:08:22.590 --> 04:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
all you have to prove it's much easier
 
04:08:24.429 --> 04:08:24.439 align:start position:0%
uh to do that the second part of this is
 
04:08:27.269 --> 04:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
they refer to animal throughout this
 
04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
bill there no legal is crazy there's no
 
04:08:33.389 --> 04:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
legal definition for animal in in our
 
04:08:36.469 --> 04:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
chapter so we described animals as wild
 
04:08:38.790 --> 04:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
animals there's a great definition for
 
04:08:41.030 --> 04:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
that there's a great definition for wild
 
04:08:44.149 --> 04:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh Birds uh and there's a there's is a
 
04:08:46.189 --> 04:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing def definition of
 
04:08:48.269 --> 04:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
wildlife which includes reptiles
 
04:08:51.429 --> 04:08:51.439 align:start position:0%
amphibians all animals so anywhere that
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
the the amendment had animals I replaced
 
04:08:56.590 --> 04:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
it with wild animal or wild bird the
 
04:08:58.990 --> 04:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
final change I put in and the commission
 
04:09:01.590 --> 04:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
told me that this would be required for
 
04:09:05.630 --> 04:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
their approval was no l if you drop down
 
04:09:08.710 --> 04:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
on um where we're instructing the
 
04:09:12.229 --> 04:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
executive director to adopt rules I put
 
04:09:14.070 --> 04:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
a space in there the ex Ive director
 
04:09:16.590 --> 04:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
shall adopt excuse me the executive
 
04:09:18.349 --> 04:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
director with the approval of the
 
04:09:20.590 --> 04:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
commission shall adopt rules pursuant to
 
04:09:23.870 --> 04:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
541a meaning the commission would have
 
04:09:25.990 --> 04:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
to approve those rules to move forward
 
04:09:28.550 --> 04:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
and then uh uh representative Harvey
 
04:09:30.189 --> 04:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely correct it would be
 
04:09:32.229 --> 04:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
public hearings so there would be a lot
 
04:09:33.870 --> 04:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
of time for input there would be a lot
 
04:09:36.309 --> 04:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
of time for making adjustments uh and
 
04:09:38.070 --> 04:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
then you come over here to JL car which
 
04:09:39.790 --> 04:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
I know you all are familiar where where
 
04:09:41.469 --> 04:09:41.479 align:start position:0%
there's another shot at that or another
 
04:09:44.109 --> 04:09:44.119 align:start position:0%
bite at that Apple so
 
04:09:46.670 --> 04:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
we would prefer I believe we would would
 
04:09:48.910 --> 04:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
have preferred the bills to be split we
 
04:09:51.109 --> 04:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
quite frankly I've been told by my my
 
04:09:52.590 --> 04:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
new director that we're going to come up
 
04:09:54.149 --> 04:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
with a want and waste description and
 
04:09:56.870 --> 04:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
Rule whether this law passes or not we
 
04:09:59.229 --> 04:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
think it's important I think she's she's
 
04:10:00.790 --> 04:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good description I
 
04:10:02.590 --> 04:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
think the prime sponsor did an excellent
 
04:10:06.149 --> 04:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
job um trying to trying to hone that
 
04:10:08.389 --> 04:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
down I think it will protect Hunter
 
04:10:11.550 --> 04:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
there's the provisions are in this bill
 
04:10:13.590 --> 04:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
in the amended version I did and in her
 
04:10:15.229 --> 04:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
amended version there's Provisions in
 
04:10:17.389 --> 04:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
there for land owners there's which will
 
04:10:18.830 --> 04:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
exclude them they can protect their
 
04:10:20.590 --> 04:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
property there's there's Provisions in
 
04:10:22.590 --> 04:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
there or will be in the rule for
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
nuisance Wildlife for animal controller
 
04:10:26.269 --> 04:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
all of those things will be considered
 
04:10:27.950 --> 04:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
that's the advantage to doing it in rule
 
04:10:30.830 --> 04:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
is it gives us the opportunity to custom
 
04:10:32.790 --> 04:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
make that so we don't interfere across
 
04:10:36.189 --> 04:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
lines that we don't want to cross so if
 
04:10:38.950 --> 04:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
if in fact the the prime sponsor and
 
04:10:41.469 --> 04:10:41.479 align:start position:0%
everyone here agreed uh with this
 
04:10:43.710 --> 04:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
version with the with the red piece that
 
04:10:45.910 --> 04:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
I put in the commission has instructed
 
04:10:47.550 --> 04:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
me they would support it and we would
 
04:10:50.790 --> 04:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
too um so just for your own information
 
04:10:53.990 --> 04:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
we are going to create want and waste in
 
04:10:56.590 --> 04:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
rule whether this bill passes or not New
 
04:10:58.349 --> 04:10:58.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's long overdue for that 12
 
04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
other states have done it I've looked at
 
04:11:03.030 --> 04:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
them all um and they and I think it's an
 
04:11:05.070 --> 04:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
important thing to do and we can do it
 
04:11:08.070 --> 04:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
as easily as we did the cruelty um I
 
04:11:10.389 --> 04:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
will tell you this you know I caution
 
04:11:12.590 --> 04:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
people all the time about social media
 
04:11:15.109 --> 04:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
we make cas is all the time based on
 
04:11:17.950 --> 04:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
social media I hate it frankly my own
 
04:11:20.149 --> 04:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
opinion I hate it I think it's
 
04:11:22.910 --> 04:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and wasteful and I really
 
04:11:24.510 --> 04:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
want to caution people for believing
 
04:11:26.389 --> 04:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
what you see on it I think a lot of
 
04:11:28.510 --> 04:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
times those I know those videos are made
 
04:11:30.630 --> 04:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
up because I've investigated them and
 
04:11:32.429 --> 04:11:32.439 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't they're not they
 
04:11:34.229 --> 04:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
don't run out the facts so and they're
 
04:11:36.070 --> 04:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
upsetting and I feel bad about that I
 
04:11:38.030 --> 04:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
don't want people thinking that that
 
04:11:40.830 --> 04:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
kind of activity goes on I will argue I
 
04:11:41.950 --> 04:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
don't think New Hampshire is
 
04:11:43.950 --> 04:11:43.960 align:start position:0%
slaughtering animals if they're doing it
 
04:11:45.670 --> 04:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
they're hiding it and they're doing a
 
04:11:46.950 --> 04:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
good job of it and I'll give you a good
 
04:11:48.550 --> 04:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
example I had an officer who took a
 
04:11:50.910 --> 04:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
young officer the other day took a duck
 
04:11:53.830 --> 04:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
a goose carcass and a turkey carcass he
 
04:11:56.229 --> 04:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
no longer needed it was used in a case
 
04:11:58.070 --> 04:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
he drove out on the Sea Coast into a
 
04:11:59.790 --> 04:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
field that he thought was very remote he
 
04:12:02.670 --> 04:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
dumped the carcass within the hour I
 
04:12:04.030 --> 04:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
received a call at headquarters about
 
04:12:06.030 --> 04:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
these two dump carcasses and that
 
04:12:07.389 --> 04:12:07.399 align:start position:0%
someone should investigate that cuz
 
04:12:09.229 --> 04:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
someone shot these things illegally so I
 
04:12:10.429 --> 04:12:10.439 align:start position:0%
find it hard to believe that we're
 
04:12:12.109 --> 04:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
shooting truckloads of coyotes and
 
04:12:13.670 --> 04:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
dumping them in the woods I think I
 
04:12:15.910 --> 04:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
would know that I think I would get that
 
04:12:18.710 --> 04:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
call unfortunately if we don't put
 
04:12:20.790 --> 04:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
something in place that could happen I
 
04:12:23.309 --> 04:12:23.319 align:start position:0%
think it could happen and then the other
 
04:12:24.710 --> 04:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
question I want to answer for you the
 
04:12:26.469 --> 04:12:26.479 align:start position:0%
wildlife contest in the states there are
 
04:12:29.349 --> 04:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of deer pools as I've said I'm
 
04:12:31.070 --> 04:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
aware of a lot of turkey pools that go
 
04:12:34.590 --> 04:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
on that are open I knew of two coyote
 
04:12:37.349 --> 04:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
contests one uh in the Rochester area no
 
04:12:39.309 --> 04:12:39.319 align:start position:0%
longer exists I don't know why but it
 
04:12:41.910 --> 04:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't um and then another individual
 
04:12:44.510 --> 04:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
who I believe just aged out of of doing
 
04:12:46.269 --> 04:12:46.279 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing but here's something
 
04:12:48.870 --> 04:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
else I want you to think about the one
 
04:12:51.630 --> 04:12:51.640 align:start position:0%
good thing about poachers is they they
 
04:12:53.550 --> 04:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
can't help themselves they want the
 
04:12:56.550 --> 04:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
world to know thank goodness because
 
04:12:58.269 --> 04:12:58.279 align:start position:0%
that's how they get caught they're not
 
04:13:00.229 --> 04:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
going to shoot the biggest coyote in the
 
04:13:01.590 --> 04:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and keep it a
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
secret they are not going to do that and
 
04:13:05.389 --> 04:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
that's why we catch them when they do
 
04:13:06.790 --> 04:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
those things they're going to post it
 
04:13:08.030 --> 04:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to take pictures of it
 
04:13:09.750 --> 04:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to share it so I really
 
04:13:11.550 --> 04:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
believe if these things were rampid we
 
04:13:13.429 --> 04:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
would know about it uh we would have
 
04:13:15.550 --> 04:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
some indication of it I think in New
 
04:13:17.309 --> 04:13:17.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it could exist cuz we don't
 
04:13:19.590 --> 04:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
have anything to prevent it and I think
 
04:13:22.429 --> 04:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
if we work together all of us if we were
 
04:13:24.189 --> 04:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
have passed this the way the way we've
 
04:13:26.109 --> 04:13:26.119 align:start position:0%
adjusted it we could come up with rules
 
04:13:28.670 --> 04:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
that might not please everyone but I
 
04:13:30.149 --> 04:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
don't think it would interfere with
 
04:13:32.389 --> 04:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
Hunters like this might passing it just
 
04:13:34.149 --> 04:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
the way it is or doing it all in law I
 
04:13:35.790 --> 04:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
think allowing it to be done in rule
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
will give people an opportunity to do
 
04:13:40.469 --> 04:13:40.479 align:start position:0%
that thank you that's all I have sir
 
04:13:43.349 --> 04:13:43.359 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey actually Mr chair
 
04:13:46.030 --> 04:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
this is a question for you um I started
 
04:13:48.309 --> 04:13:48.319 align:start position:0%
the morning out quite organized and then
 
04:13:51.910 --> 04:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
it it disappeared discombobulated yes
 
04:13:55.510 --> 04:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
that do we have his Amendment yes it's
 
04:13:56.590 --> 04:13:56.600 align:start position:0%

04:14:00.389 --> 04:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
red and I apologize for
 
04:14:03.149 --> 04:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
that oh I think actually I think only
 
04:14:06.349 --> 04:14:06.359 align:start position:0%
the three up here got it we'll we'll get
 
04:14:09.990 --> 04:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
copies not a problem okay um I can pass
 
04:14:11.429 --> 04:14:11.439 align:start position:0%
mine over to you so you can look at it
 
04:14:13.429 --> 04:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
if you like
 
04:14:15.149 --> 04:14:15.159 align:start position:0%
I don't have anything in
 
04:14:18.389 --> 04:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
red pass that over
 
04:14:20.670 --> 04:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
sorry any actual questions for the
 
04:14:22.750 --> 04:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
colonel representative
 
04:14:24.990 --> 04:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
tutor thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:14:26.710 --> 04:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question that I was just
 
04:14:28.910 --> 04:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
reading the amendment and it came to a
 
04:14:30.550 --> 04:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
question that I asked one of the
 
04:14:32.269 --> 04:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
presenters earlier let me just read you
 
04:14:34.349 --> 04:14:34.359 align:start position:0%
what the amendment says and ask your
 
04:14:35.469 --> 04:14:35.479 align:start position:0%
question you can tell me whether you
 
04:14:38.189 --> 04:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
think you'd arrest me yes sir um want
 
04:14:40.189 --> 04:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
way shall include the removal of the
 
04:14:43.630 --> 04:14:43.640 align:start position:0%
head hide tail or antas from a game
 
04:14:46.189 --> 04:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
animal and leaving the edible portion to
 
04:14:48.790 --> 04:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
waste yes so if I shoot a fox and take
 
04:14:51.510 --> 04:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
the fur and leave the meat in my that
 
04:14:53.710 --> 04:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
would not be that would not be wanting
 
04:14:55.910 --> 04:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
waste in my opinion I've left the I've
 
04:14:59.030 --> 04:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
took the hide Y and left them want and
 
04:15:01.550 --> 04:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
waste would be um you we had an
 
04:15:03.109 --> 04:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
individual shooting moose cutting the
 
04:15:04.830 --> 04:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
ear off and leaving the rest of the
 
04:15:06.910 --> 04:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
animal on the ground or guys
 
04:15:09.269 --> 04:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
taking I shouldn't say guys people
 
04:15:11.510 --> 04:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
taking shooting deer at night taking the
 
04:15:12.950 --> 04:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
hind quarter and leaving the rest of the
 
04:15:15.149 --> 04:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
animal in the wood that's want and waste
 
04:15:17.590 --> 04:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
um I think and and understand this
 
04:15:19.269 --> 04:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
whenever you guys know this whenever you
 
04:15:22.189 --> 04:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
create a law you can't bulletproof it
 
04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
and it comes down to officer discretion
 
04:15:25.389 --> 04:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm confident that we have some good
 
04:15:27.189 --> 04:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
officers that use good discretion so
 
04:15:28.950 --> 04:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
things like that would be would be taken
 
04:15:31.189 --> 04:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
into consideration yes and I will tell
 
04:15:32.790 --> 04:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
you the other thing that bothered me
 
04:15:34.550 --> 04:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
running coyotes down with snow machines
 
04:15:36.590 --> 04:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tell you something I will
 
04:15:39.030 --> 04:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
prosecute them and there are good laws
 
04:15:41.189 --> 04:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
on the books to do that that is illegal
 
04:15:43.109 --> 04:15:43.119 align:start position:0%
method of take that is harassment
 
04:15:45.109 --> 04:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
Wildlife that could border on cruelty of
 
04:15:47.990 --> 04:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
Wildlife and I would never tolerate an
 
04:15:51.189 --> 04:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
act like that we we make cases on people
 
04:15:53.429 --> 04:15:53.439 align:start position:0%
running over intentionally running over
 
04:15:55.469 --> 04:15:55.479 align:start position:0%
Wildlife turkeys are the biggest one
 
04:15:56.990 --> 04:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
they'll see a flock they get sick of
 
04:15:58.309 --> 04:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
them being in a road and they'll drive
 
04:16:00.630 --> 04:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
through them and we' made cases on that
 
04:16:03.389 --> 04:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
multiple times multiple times just like
 
04:16:05.229 --> 04:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
the Flaming moose yeah it's not you're
 
04:16:06.630 --> 04:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
not going to to I'm not well not no
 
04:16:08.269 --> 04:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
one's going to tolerate that most
 
04:16:10.149 --> 04:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
coyotes I've run into would be pretty
 
04:16:11.590 --> 04:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
would get away from the snow machine
 
04:16:14.670 --> 04:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
pretty quick yeah any other questions
 
04:16:16.229 --> 04:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I'm not saying it
 
04:16:17.710 --> 04:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't happen I'm saying we wouldn't
 
04:16:19.109 --> 04:16:19.119 align:start position:0%
tolerate it there's a there's a
 
04:16:20.910 --> 04:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
difference there thank you Mr chairman
 
04:16:22.550 --> 04:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
and thank you Colonel excuse me for
 
04:16:25.429 --> 04:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question I you you didn't hit
 
04:16:26.950 --> 04:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
on this but I think it's important for
 
04:16:28.910 --> 04:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
you to elaborate in the want and waste
 
04:16:31.030 --> 04:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
definition where it talks about without
 
04:16:32.870 --> 04:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
making a reasonable effort to retrieve
 
04:16:35.349 --> 04:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
Salvage and render it I know reasonable
 
04:16:37.510 --> 04:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
is very subjective yes what's reasonable
 
04:16:39.109 --> 04:16:39.119 align:start position:0%
to one officer is might not be to
 
04:16:41.830 --> 04:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
another absolutely it's is that going to
 
04:16:43.550 --> 04:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
be left up to a field determination I
 
04:16:45.269 --> 04:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
mean who's going to make that decision
 
04:16:47.229 --> 04:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
we we debated that a lot for that very
 
04:16:49.389 --> 04:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
reason so to me that common sense is
 
04:16:50.950 --> 04:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable a reasonable effort would be
 
04:16:53.830 --> 04:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
someone who who would not just shoot and
 
04:16:55.870 --> 04:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
turn and walk away he would make some
 
04:16:58.149 --> 04:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
effort to and most hunters do they go to
 
04:17:01.870 --> 04:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
Great Lengths to to uh and and Kyle BR
 
04:17:03.109 --> 04:17:03.119 align:start position:0%
brought up a good point a lot of the
 
04:17:04.910 --> 04:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
hunters that we search for are actually
 
04:17:07.710 --> 04:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
looking for deer when they get lost so
 
04:17:10.309 --> 04:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
um but I think in rule we would have to
 
04:17:11.950 --> 04:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
work on defining that a little better
 
04:17:13.550 --> 04:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
for our judges cuz I want to make sure
 
04:17:15.030 --> 04:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
the judges are on board so I think there
 
04:17:16.950 --> 04:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
would have to be a little further
 
04:17:18.510 --> 04:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
definition of that this wouldn't if
 
04:17:21.950 --> 04:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
we're if we're and this uh sponsor
 
04:17:24.710 --> 04:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative that brought the Schultz
 
04:17:26.910 --> 04:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
who I've never met I really appreciate
 
04:17:29.510 --> 04:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
you bringing this representative she if
 
04:17:31.590 --> 04:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
she's doing what we ask she's she's
 
04:17:33.510 --> 04:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
trying to give us the authority to do it
 
04:17:35.750 --> 04:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
in rule so it's not real clear here with
 
04:17:37.830 --> 04:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
the idea it will be cleared up in Rule
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
and I I would agree with that that's the
 
04:17:41.309 --> 04:17:41.319 align:start position:0%
way to do that and I'll tell the the
 
04:17:43.510 --> 04:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
other thing as you know if we do
 
04:17:45.750 --> 04:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
something in Rule and it doesn't work
 
04:17:48.030 --> 04:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
and we have to revisit it if it's in law
 
04:17:50.149 --> 04:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
it takes two years to and a lot of
 
04:17:51.950 --> 04:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
issues with rule we can do it almost
 
04:17:54.030 --> 04:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
immediately we can fix it so that's why
 
04:17:56.870 --> 04:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
we wanted to do it in rule but that need
 
04:18:00.309 --> 04:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:03.229 --> 04:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
Khan thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:18:06.510 --> 04:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
Corell taking my question so we heard
 
04:18:10.269 --> 04:18:10.279 align:start position:0%
from uh U chairman of the ficient Game
 
04:18:13.070 --> 04:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
Commission that we he doesn't know that
 
04:18:15.469 --> 04:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
we have any competition in the state of
 
04:18:18.630 --> 04:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if I heard it right and
 
04:18:23.229 --> 04:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
also you said that you know the uh the
 
04:18:27.030 --> 04:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
won animal West you know uh the
 
04:18:29.429 --> 04:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
commission is going to change the rule
 
04:18:31.429 --> 04:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
in future near future because you think
 
04:18:33.670 --> 04:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
that that's needed to be my director
 
04:18:35.510 --> 04:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
wants to do that yes and I and I'm on
 
04:18:37.389 --> 04:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
board with that we I in my opinion we
 
04:18:38.950 --> 04:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
have to run that by the commission but I
 
04:18:40.469 --> 04:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
believe the commission wants that as
 
04:18:42.349 --> 04:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
well so my question is you know if
 
04:18:44.109 --> 04:18:44.119 align:start position:0%
everybody is in the same page we don't
 
04:18:46.189 --> 04:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
have a problem and we going to change it
 
04:18:49.229 --> 04:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
through our you existing rule why we
 
04:18:51.950 --> 04:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
need a new law for this
 
04:18:55.830 --> 04:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
purpose well I think that I now I'm
 
04:18:57.750 --> 04:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
speaking to what I think they
 
04:19:00.590 --> 04:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
think putting myself in their shoes I
 
04:19:02.950 --> 04:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
think they want to make sure it's done
 
04:19:04.429 --> 04:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
and so putting it in
 
04:19:07.990 --> 04:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
law makes it happen I personally I think
 
04:19:10.469 --> 04:19:10.479 align:start position:0%
it would be done without it but but I
 
04:19:12.189 --> 04:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
think the reason that they I think
 
04:19:13.790 --> 04:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
originally they weren't going to put it
 
04:19:16.349 --> 04:19:16.359 align:start position:0%
in Rule and then we convinced them to
 
04:19:18.469 --> 04:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
change this to putting it allowing us to
 
04:19:19.469 --> 04:19:19.479 align:start position:0%
put it in
 
04:19:24.030 --> 04:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
rule thank follow thank you uh Corell so
 
04:19:27.910 --> 04:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
we are doing that we thinking that uh in
 
04:19:29.790 --> 04:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
future we might have a problem and we
 
04:19:34.070 --> 04:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:36.990 --> 04:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
law I don't know that I can say that I
 
04:19:39.229 --> 04:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
don't know that I can say that I I don't
 
04:19:41.630 --> 04:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
know that the problem is I don't I don't
 
04:19:45.670 --> 04:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
agree the problem is ramp it um I I
 
04:19:48.349 --> 04:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know what I think about
 
04:19:50.630 --> 04:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
that any other
 
04:19:53.830 --> 04:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you sir the
 
04:19:58.429 --> 04:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
chair will now close the hearing on uh
 
04:20:02.750 --> 04:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:06.429 --> 04:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
FN and we will move and can the rest of
 
04:20:07.990 --> 04:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
the committee get I took a picture we're
 
04:20:10.710 --> 04:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
going to get a copy okay made okay okay
 
04:20:12.269 --> 04:20:12.279 align:start position:0%
yeah I took a picture but um we will get
 
04:20:13.910 --> 04:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
a copy made but first I need to open
 
04:20:15.630 --> 04:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
this and then the the clerk can run out
 
04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
with a request for a copy thank you I'm
 
04:20:20.870 --> 04:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
going to now move directly into uh
 
04:20:30.389 --> 04:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:33.349 --> 04:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
FN I recognize the prime sponsor Jack
 
04:20:36.510 --> 04:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
Flanigan representative Flanigan my
 
04:21:02.109 --> 04:21:02.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
he can sit next to you we'll actually
 
04:21:05.630 --> 04:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
consider you both testifying at the same
 
04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
time if that's fine and that'll save us
 
04:21:07.199 --> 04:21:11.109 align:start position:0%
time if that's fine and that'll save us
some

04:21:11.109 --> 04:21:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:13.510 --> 04:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
time although I'm running behind by an
 
04:21:42.750 --> 04:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:45.389 --> 04:21:45.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh for the
 
04:21:49.550 --> 04:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:52.710 --> 04:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
here there you go um for the record uh
 
04:21:54.309 --> 04:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
my name is Jack Flanigan I represent
 
04:21:57.550 --> 04:21:57.560 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 45 which is a florial of four
 
04:22:00.030 --> 04:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
towns Hallis Brookline Mason and
 
04:22:02.510 --> 04:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
Greenville four towns that are border
 
04:22:04.710 --> 04:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
towns I suppose with the state of
 
04:22:07.550 --> 04:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um I introduced this this
 
04:22:10.149 --> 04:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation after meeting Mr
 
04:22:12.630 --> 04:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
zil Felder here next to me who has asked
 
04:22:15.590 --> 04:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh I've asked him to be part of this
 
04:22:18.550 --> 04:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
because I've known him for 30 years from
 
04:22:21.510 --> 04:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
other activities but he's the one that
 
04:22:25.030 --> 04:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
sort of got me into this servid issue
 
04:22:25.040 --> 04:22:26.389 align:start position:0%
sort of got me into this servid issue
basically

04:22:26.389 --> 04:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:22:31.630 --> 04:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
CWD um the um Mr zelder is very
 
04:22:35.349 --> 04:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about it he uh as some
 
04:22:37.229 --> 04:22:37.239 align:start position:0%
people might have habits of her interest
 
04:22:39.670 --> 04:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
of you know photography or fishing or
 
04:22:42.149 --> 04:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
whatever I won't talk about the previous
 
04:22:42.159 --> 04:22:43.469 align:start position:0%
whatever I won't talk about the previous
bill

04:22:43.469 --> 04:22:43.479 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:22:47.269 --> 04:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
his interest is deer and other
 
04:22:50.109 --> 04:22:50.119 align:start position:0%
servants but when he told me about CWD
 
04:22:52.870 --> 04:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
and the impact on animals health and
 
04:22:55.790 --> 04:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
potentially human health I thought
 
04:22:57.910 --> 04:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
well you know how do we make sure this
 
04:22:59.109 --> 04:22:59.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen and he says well New
 
04:23:02.109 --> 04:23:02.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's been pretty good um but also
 
04:23:04.149 --> 04:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
other states are not so good as far as
 
04:23:06.710 --> 04:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
CWD and I think he has some information
 
04:23:09.189 --> 04:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the frequency of it but
 
04:23:10.630 --> 04:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
then it was well I knew people that
 
04:23:12.830 --> 04:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
would go hunting in other other states
 
04:23:15.590 --> 04:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
and bring the deer back and they said
 
04:23:17.229 --> 04:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
well how do we make sure that they don't
 
04:23:18.389 --> 04:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
bring back
 
04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
CWD because in talking to Mr zelder it
 
04:23:24.670 --> 04:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
can be spread from the stool of the
 
04:23:27.990 --> 04:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
animal uh or if it was a tick uh the
 
04:23:30.830 --> 04:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
tick could spread the disease too so
 
04:23:33.469 --> 04:23:33.479 align:start position:0%
he's got more detail in it but the
 
04:23:35.790 --> 04:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
reality is is we've got to make sure
 
04:23:37.630 --> 04:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
that if we bring
 
04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
animal the harvested animal into the
 
04:23:41.830 --> 04:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
state that we're not bringing the
 
04:23:45.429 --> 04:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
disease in with it so uh Mr chairman
 
04:23:47.269 --> 04:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions you may have of
 
04:23:50.269 --> 04:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
me but I like I said the technical part
 
04:23:52.389 --> 04:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
that's why I brought him along hand it
 
04:23:52.399 --> 04:23:54.070 align:start position:0%
that's why I brought him along hand it
right

04:23:54.070 --> 04:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:23:58.469 --> 04:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
over um and I'm not an expert by any
 
04:24:02.269 --> 04:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
means I just I I do have an interest in
 
04:24:02.279 --> 04:24:03.950 align:start position:0%
means I just I I do have an interest in
Deer

04:24:03.950 --> 04:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
Deer
 
04:24:03.960 --> 04:24:05.870 align:start position:0%
Deer
um

04:24:05.870 --> 04:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:09.030 --> 04:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
I probably was a little bit foolish and
 
04:24:12.109 --> 04:24:12.119 align:start position:0%
about 5 years ago I set some alerts and
 
04:24:14.830 --> 04:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
every every single article published on
 
04:24:18.750 --> 04:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
PubMed and Google Scholar on CWD is is
 
04:24:21.550 --> 04:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
sent to me just because of my interest
 
04:24:25.870 --> 04:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
in things um right now there's currently
 
04:24:30.670 --> 04:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
36 states that owledge
 
04:24:34.189 --> 04:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
CWD how many copies do we have there
 
04:24:36.990 --> 04:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
there's like six there but I can provide
 
04:24:39.469 --> 04:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
anything we can we can provide a link Mr
 
04:24:42.710 --> 04:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
chairman um one thing I just wanted to
 
04:24:45.750 --> 04:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
talk about quickly is uh like cancer and
 
04:24:48.790 --> 04:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
pregnancy you can either have cancer or
 
04:24:51.990 --> 04:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
you don't you are either pregnant or you
 
04:24:55.630 --> 04:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
aren't cancer untreated the disease
 
04:24:58.070 --> 04:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
progresses and of course if you let a
 
04:25:01.510 --> 04:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
pregnancy continue it goes to
 
04:25:03.950 --> 04:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
termination I I bring that up because
 
04:25:05.349 --> 04:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
the same for
 
04:25:09.070 --> 04:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
CWD like DNA testing testing for CWD has
 
04:25:12.790 --> 04:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
got a lot better in recent years
 
04:25:15.429 --> 04:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
there are things that we do now that I
 
04:25:18.109 --> 04:25:18.119 align:start position:0%
believe in um removing the head before
 
04:25:20.910 --> 04:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
you bring a serve it in from other
 
04:25:24.870 --> 04:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
states because of the preal prevalency
 
04:25:28.269 --> 04:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
of the infected prons in the brain but
 
04:25:33.670 --> 04:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
we know that is most common later
 
04:25:37.030 --> 04:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
stages um even though Wildlife agencies
 
04:25:39.870 --> 04:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
try to pin the blame on captive herds
 
04:25:42.710 --> 04:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
there are far more confirmations in hter
 
04:25:46.670 --> 04:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
harvested or roadkill servid and again I
 
04:25:48.870 --> 04:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that it's known that
 
04:25:51.030 --> 04:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not anti fishing game I'm not
 
04:25:53.469 --> 04:25:53.479 align:start position:0%
hunting I don't have a horse in this
 
04:25:57.469 --> 04:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
race a bunch of my friends hunt I
 
04:25:59.790 --> 04:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
understand the sport in the passion and
 
04:26:01.990 --> 04:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to interfere with that he
 
04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
just asked me to speak on some facts so
 
04:26:09.950 --> 04:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
anyway far more confirmations in Hunter
 
04:26:13.710 --> 04:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
harvested or Road killed servid than
 
04:26:13.720 --> 04:26:15.950 align:start position:0%
harvested or Road killed servid than
captive

04:26:15.950 --> 04:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
captive
 
04:26:18.469 --> 04:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
Farms the the
 
04:26:21.630 --> 04:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
current um New Hampshire fishing game p
 
04:26:23.469 --> 04:26:23.479 align:start position:0%
this side instead doesn't
 
04:26:26.590 --> 04:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
matter we I I told them to make 20 but I
 
04:26:28.590 --> 04:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
don't think we did I
 
04:26:31.229 --> 04:26:31.239 align:start position:0%
didn't so the current fishing game
 
04:26:34.590 --> 04:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
published CW information lacks
 
04:26:37.910 --> 04:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
detail it does not acknowledge that
 
04:26:42.309 --> 04:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
prons are misfolded proteins and are
 
04:26:45.309 --> 04:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
detectable in all tissues tested
 
04:26:49.590 --> 04:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
including muscle before so so I remember
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman a conversation when you you
 
04:26:53.670 --> 04:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
thought that CWD was only in the brain
 
04:26:55.950 --> 04:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
as far as testing all the research is
 
04:26:57.590 --> 04:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
now showing that it's it's a blood
 
04:27:03.389 --> 04:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
related illness gotcha not not only is
 
04:27:05.830 --> 04:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
it in all the tissues of the infected
 
04:27:09.109 --> 04:27:09.119 align:start position:0%
cids but you can pull a tick from an
 
04:27:18.750 --> 04:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:20.269 --> 04:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
just so the committee knows all these
 
04:27:21.590 --> 04:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
copies are going to the clerk and she'll
 
04:27:23.269 --> 04:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
make copies for
 
04:27:29.750 --> 04:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
everybody in my real work I've worked at
 
04:27:32.109 --> 04:27:32.119 align:start position:0%
very high-end professional motorcycle
 
04:27:35.429 --> 04:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
racing all over the world and I've come
 
04:27:38.149 --> 04:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
to understand in certain areas you work
 
04:27:42.269 --> 04:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
with the absolute leaders in those areas
 
04:27:45.990 --> 04:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
and I've in my interest on this I'm also
 
04:27:48.349 --> 04:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
communicating with researchers all over
 
04:27:51.790 --> 04:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
the world on this
 
04:27:55.710 --> 04:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
disease um this is an example of
 
04:27:58.590 --> 04:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
one um in
 
04:28:01.830 --> 04:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
communicating with him I had a
 
04:28:06.070 --> 04:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
question I asked about could CWD be
 
04:28:09.910 --> 04:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
detected in myoglobin myoglobin when we
 
04:28:12.830 --> 04:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
cook a steak most people think the red
 
04:28:15.590 --> 04:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
juice is blood but that's a
 
04:28:18.469 --> 04:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
myoglobin I said if not same question
 
04:28:20.590 --> 04:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
for any of the parts that would be
 
04:28:23.630 --> 04:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
harvested in hunting
 
04:28:26.590 --> 04:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
activities his response was I'm not sure
 
04:28:29.229 --> 04:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
if anybody has examined myoglobin
 
04:28:31.389 --> 04:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
products for the presence of
 
04:28:40.149 --> 04:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:45.269 --> 04:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
muscles but also basically all examined
 
04:28:48.910 --> 04:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
tissues bodily fluids blood cerebral
 
04:28:52.950 --> 04:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
spinal fluid saliva and excretions urine
 
04:28:56.429 --> 04:28:56.439 align:start position:0%
and feces from CWD affected cervids
 
04:29:01.550 --> 04:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:05.510 --> 04:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
prons Mr chairman I he was motivated to
 
04:29:07.990 --> 04:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
bring the the meat along but I think
 
04:29:11.229 --> 04:29:11.239 align:start position:0%
he's trying to stress my my point is
 
04:29:17.990 --> 04:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:25.590 --> 04:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:29.469 --> 04:29:29.479 align:start position:0%
is okay I believe there needs to be
 
04:29:31.349 --> 04:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
regulation around
 
04:29:35.389 --> 04:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
CWD currently you can't import alive
 
04:29:39.429 --> 04:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
non-native servage screened for CWD yet
 
04:29:43.670 --> 04:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
naive people to CWD can go hunt and
 
04:29:46.349 --> 04:29:46.359 align:start position:0%
potentially bring infected tissues
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:53.670 --> 04:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
regulation does anybody here know how
 
04:29:59.189 --> 04:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
long a servid can go without showing any
 
04:30:05.550 --> 04:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:08.750 --> 04:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
infection it it does and the larger
 
04:30:13.030 --> 04:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
animals can go 5 years now without any
 
04:30:13.040 --> 04:30:15.070 align:start position:0%
animals can go 5 years now without any
indication

04:30:15.070 --> 04:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
indication
 
04:30:18.550 --> 04:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
okay the the point of that is what do a
 
04:30:21.309 --> 04:30:21.319 align:start position:0%
lot of people want to go out a stay in
 
04:30:24.189 --> 04:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
Hunt so
 
04:30:27.349 --> 04:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
again my discussions with Fish and Game
 
04:30:31.950 --> 04:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
have been about protecting the herd um
 
04:30:36.229 --> 04:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
this prion is extremely infectious you
 
04:30:39.750 --> 04:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
cannot incinerate it 1600 Dees won't
 
04:30:43.950 --> 04:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:50.269 --> 04:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
not everybody likes the taste of cids I
 
04:30:53.510 --> 04:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
I have an employee that's an avid Hunter
 
04:30:57.309 --> 04:30:57.319 align:start position:0%
he went to the Midwest shot a servid
 
04:31:01.030 --> 04:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
that had a very very high diet of sage
 
04:31:03.309 --> 04:31:03.319 align:start position:0%
and as passionate as he is about honey
 
04:31:05.550 --> 04:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
he couldn't stand the taste of it when
 
04:31:10.070 --> 04:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
you throw that away where's it going
 
04:31:14.710 --> 04:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:16.590 --> 04:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
potentially you know we're we're
 
04:31:19.429 --> 04:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
spreading there's there's tests being
 
04:31:23.269 --> 04:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
done right now on articles clothing
 
04:31:27.269 --> 04:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
knives boots all all kinds of stuff you
 
04:31:27.279 --> 04:31:28.469 align:start position:0%
knives boots all all kinds of stuff you
can

04:31:28.469 --> 04:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:31:30.950 --> 04:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
prove how how it
 
04:31:30.960 --> 04:31:33.550 align:start position:0%
prove how how it
moves

04:31:33.550 --> 04:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
moves
 
04:31:38.030 --> 04:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
um so just one last quick
 
04:31:41.149 --> 04:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
thing penil Pennsylvania is not the
 
04:31:44.389 --> 04:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
worst State when it comes to CWD
 
04:31:46.750 --> 04:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
confirmations but it happens to be close
 
04:31:49.830 --> 04:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
and they do have a real problem down
 
04:31:54.229 --> 04:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
there they also have a very good website
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
with data and you can clearly clearly
 
04:32:00.349 --> 04:32:00.359 align:start position:0%
this this is real time I printed it
 
04:32:02.670 --> 04:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
before I left my office this morning you
 
04:32:05.910 --> 04:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
can clearly see the hunted Hunter
 
04:32:09.710 --> 04:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
harvested detections are far greater the
 
04:32:13.109 --> 04:32:13.119 align:start position:0%
roadkill detections are far greater than
 
04:32:17.710 --> 04:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:19.990 --> 04:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
facility another thing Mr chairman too
 
04:32:22.109 --> 04:32:22.119 align:start position:0%
if I can just interrupt Mr zelder is
 
04:32:24.229 --> 04:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
that he had provided me a list I I
 
04:32:26.670 --> 04:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
assume it was a current list of states
 
04:32:30.790 --> 04:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
that that had active CWD animals that
 
04:32:33.510 --> 04:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
they stopped um remember they listed the
 
04:32:36.030 --> 04:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
Colorado had some or Pennsylvania but it
 
04:32:38.309 --> 04:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
was where was that CWD
 
04:32:44.030 --> 04:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
dog CWD info. org okay
 
04:32:46.590 --> 04:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
which it's a very good website it's
 
04:32:51.149 --> 04:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
known as the website um but there's no
 
04:32:53.269 --> 04:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
detail there's no real information but
 
04:32:55.189 --> 04:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
if you go there you will see how
 
04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
prevalent the confirmations are all over
 
04:33:00.990 --> 04:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
the place the harvested meat right
 
04:33:03.150 --> 04:33:03.160 align:start position:0%
primarily yeah
 
04:33:06.551 --> 04:33:06.561 align:start position:0%
um and again I'm I'm not an expert I'm
 
04:33:08.990 --> 04:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
just a person that's had a real interest
 
04:33:14.269 --> 04:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
in this um but but because of all the
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
information that I received some of the
 
04:33:19.750 --> 04:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
information that I've had um honestly
 
04:33:19.760 --> 04:33:21.150 align:start position:0%
information that I've had um honestly
CDC

04:33:21.150 --> 04:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
CDC
 
04:33:23.629 --> 04:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
changed uh some information on their
 
04:33:27.670 --> 04:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
website because of some things and uh
 
04:33:30.070 --> 04:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
lisiana a couple of years back when they
 
04:33:31.470 --> 04:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
had their first
 
04:33:33.869 --> 04:33:33.879 align:start position:0%
confirmation they tried to pin it on
 
04:33:36.390 --> 04:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
captive herds and it wasn't the case it
 
04:33:38.910 --> 04:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
was H harvested and they had to correct
 
04:33:41.830 --> 04:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
the information untested too right
 
04:33:43.629 --> 04:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
what's that the animals were
 
04:33:47.230 --> 04:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
untested uh the the herded animals no no
 
04:33:49.269 --> 04:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
it was a hunter harvested animal that
 
04:33:50.750 --> 04:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
tested positive the first time around
 
04:33:52.629 --> 04:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
please try to direct your questions and
 
04:33:54.109 --> 04:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
comments to the chair and the and the
 
04:33:56.470 --> 04:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
committee not between your the point is
 
04:33:58.629 --> 04:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
it it was trying to be deflected in
 
04:34:02.349 --> 04:34:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:06.029 --> 04:34:06.039 align:start position:0%
y thank you is do you have more be open
 
04:34:07.470 --> 04:34:07.480 align:start position:0%
for questions I don't I'm open for
 
04:34:09.551 --> 04:34:09.561 align:start position:0%
questions okay are there any questions
 
04:34:13.390 --> 04:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey um so in reading
 
04:34:17.310 --> 04:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
the bill um Mr berson from fish and game
 
04:34:19.230 --> 04:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
last week testified they do know what
 
04:34:22.070 --> 04:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
states have CWD um doesn't surprise me
 
04:34:23.709 --> 04:34:23.719 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania because of its large deer
 
04:34:26.830 --> 04:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
population but my question is
 
04:34:30.750 --> 04:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
um if if you're um if you take meat
 
04:34:31.949 --> 04:34:31.959 align:start position:0%
outside of the
 
04:34:34.670 --> 04:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
state you need to have a tested for C
 
04:34:37.230 --> 04:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
CWD prior to bring the meat into New
 
04:34:40.429 --> 04:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um how would that work I I
 
04:34:41.990 --> 04:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't know how where where would you
 
04:34:44.590 --> 04:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
take this to have it practiced for for
 
04:34:48.029 --> 04:34:48.039 align:start position:0%
me that's an excellent question um I
 
04:34:50.949 --> 04:34:50.959 align:start position:0%
think fishing game should be the driving
 
04:34:54.510 --> 04:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
force behind that my my point is to show
 
04:34:54.520 --> 04:34:55.949 align:start position:0%
force behind that my my point is to show
you

04:34:55.949 --> 04:34:55.959 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:34:59.269 --> 04:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
that the information available now is
 
04:35:01.470 --> 04:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
very different than what it was it's no
 
04:35:03.629 --> 04:35:03.639 align:start position:0%
different than DNA testing you all know
 
04:35:06.150 --> 04:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
how that is evolved over the
 
04:35:09.590 --> 04:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
years um I think with upto-date
 
04:35:13.230 --> 04:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
information you should make in formed
 
04:35:16.349 --> 04:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
decisions and that is a big one but if
 
04:35:19.670 --> 04:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
you are really concerned about
 
04:35:23.990 --> 04:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
protecting the herd this needs to be
 
04:35:27.150 --> 04:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
looked at and addressed followup please
 
04:35:30.150 --> 04:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
followup so I might have to ask this of
 
04:35:32.349 --> 04:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
fishing game and not you but I'll start
 
04:35:34.709 --> 04:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
here um does fishing game have a a
 
04:35:37.869 --> 04:35:37.879 align:start position:0%
procedure for processing
 
04:35:42.510 --> 04:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
meat uh fish fishing game does oh
 
04:35:46.070 --> 04:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
um you know there's there's debate
 
04:35:50.269 --> 04:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
currently on the test currently being
 
04:35:52.470 --> 04:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
used versus some newer
 
04:35:55.629 --> 04:35:55.639 align:start position:0%
tests you you need to understand and why
 
04:35:59.670 --> 04:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
I brought the ground beef is
 
04:36:02.269 --> 04:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
CWD to me when I first started looking
 
04:36:05.070 --> 04:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
at it was this
 
04:36:08.390 --> 04:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
overwhelming subject very very
 
04:36:10.990 --> 04:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
complicated and as I started talking to
 
04:36:13.390 --> 04:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
people in reading more and more I
 
04:36:15.750 --> 04:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
started thinking more about prion
 
04:36:17.750 --> 04:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
disease in
 
04:36:20.150 --> 04:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
general most people in this room are
 
04:36:22.189 --> 04:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
going to remember the late 80s and early
 
04:36:25.470 --> 04:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
90s the mad cow disease that happened in
 
04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
Europe that was prion disease in cattle
 
04:36:31.949 --> 04:36:31.959 align:start position:0%
it happens in cats it honestly can
 
04:36:36.269 --> 04:36:36.279 align:start position:0%
happen in camel now it's um chronic
 
04:36:40.709 --> 04:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
wasting disease in cids um it's Scrapy
 
04:36:42.269 --> 04:36:42.279 align:start position:0%
in Goat
 
04:36:46.109 --> 04:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
in sheep uh and in humans it's known as
 
04:36:49.750 --> 04:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
kutzel decob disease and there's several
 
04:36:54.750 --> 04:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
variants of that at this point um H
 
04:36:57.910 --> 04:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
honestly like there's one person that
 
04:37:01.310 --> 04:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
died of uh prion disease in New
 
04:37:03.670 --> 04:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire last year two years ago it was
 
04:37:06.390 --> 04:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
two three years ago it was
 
04:37:10.349 --> 04:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
three um one of the things I'd like to
 
04:37:12.629 --> 04:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
urge this group group is whenever
 
04:37:15.470 --> 04:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
there's a discussion a debate or a Ru
 
04:37:18.470 --> 04:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
making process around Pyon disease you
 
04:37:23.029 --> 04:37:23.039 align:start position:0%
really need to bring some experts in um
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was involved in a
 
04:37:30.670 --> 04:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
very big lawsuit in 2013 because a
 
04:37:33.310 --> 04:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
person was misdiagnosed here and again
 
04:37:36.109 --> 04:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
it's extremely infectious and it was
 
04:37:38.750 --> 04:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
brain surgery and then they used the
 
04:37:41.551 --> 04:37:41.561 align:start position:0%
equipment on other people not knowing it
 
04:37:45.670 --> 04:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:49.269 --> 04:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:51.629 --> 04:37:51.639 align:start position:0%
Durkin thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:37:53.429 --> 04:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
um what are we looking at as far as the
 
04:37:59.910 --> 04:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
cost for a test and the time for it
 
04:38:03.189 --> 04:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
again like I would defer to fishing game
 
04:38:05.910 --> 04:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
last I knew and I believe fishing game
 
04:38:07.830 --> 04:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
was used in a lab in Pennsylvania for
 
04:38:11.789 --> 04:38:11.799 align:start position:0%
their tests here it was around $50 for
 
04:38:14.470 --> 04:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
the type of tests they were doing what I
 
04:38:17.310 --> 04:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
don't understand is there's an awful lot
 
04:38:21.869 --> 04:38:21.879 align:start position:0%
of states that provide CWD testing for
 
04:38:24.590 --> 04:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
free whether that's Federal money I I
 
04:38:27.830 --> 04:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
don't know again that's not my area but
 
04:38:31.189 --> 04:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
I would look into those things in and
 
04:38:34.390 --> 04:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
honestly maybe it needs to be on the
 
04:38:38.709 --> 04:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
states where the CWD is known to be
 
04:38:41.470 --> 04:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
prevalent Mr chairman if I could go back
 
04:38:42.750 --> 04:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
back to the other representative's
 
04:38:45.189 --> 04:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
question as far as uh the testing was
 
04:38:47.551 --> 04:38:47.561 align:start position:0%
concerned and we'll get back and please
 
04:38:49.230 --> 04:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
don't know because I wanted to share too
 
04:38:52.150 --> 04:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
is rul making will allow uh the fishing
 
04:38:55.189 --> 04:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
game to decide as it relates to how it's
 
04:38:58.070 --> 04:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
tested who does the testing and at some
 
04:39:01.269 --> 04:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
point in time the costs um my goal
 
04:39:03.230 --> 04:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
though and I fishing game might like it
 
04:39:04.590 --> 04:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
is I'd rather have the hunter stay in
 
04:39:07.150 --> 04:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
state than go to another state so if it
 
04:39:09.629 --> 04:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
does cost a little bit more to get the
 
04:39:12.029 --> 04:39:12.039 align:start position:0%
the meat tested more Reon to stay in New
 
04:39:13.869 --> 04:39:13.879 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and get a license to hunt in
 
04:39:13.879 --> 04:39:14.709 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and get a license to hunt in
New

04:39:14.709 --> 04:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:39:17.109 --> 04:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that was one thing that I was
 
04:39:18.310 --> 04:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
thinking about when I introduced the
 
04:39:19.750 --> 04:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
bill and I hope that answered your
 
04:39:22.869 --> 04:39:22.879 align:start position:0%
question go ahead sir I'm sorry follow
 
04:39:26.390 --> 04:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
up follow up
 
04:39:29.429 --> 04:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
um so you had said that there were
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
counts of people having the proton
 
04:39:36.349 --> 04:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
proton the prons prons so is that are
 
04:39:38.750 --> 04:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
you telling me that the
 
04:39:41.948 --> 04:39:41.958 align:start position:0%
CWD has made the crossover from
 
04:39:45.708 --> 04:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
no the cude no I'm saying pron
 
04:39:49.590 --> 04:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
diseases exist in several different
 
04:39:55.868 --> 04:39:55.878 align:start position:0%
species we all know that BSE in cattle
 
04:39:58.550 --> 04:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
the prion disease in cattle is zuntic
 
04:40:01.070 --> 04:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's why it created I'm sorry what is
 
04:40:02.990 --> 04:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
what zuntic when it what that what does
 
04:40:05.350 --> 04:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
that mean when it goes from one species
 
04:40:07.350 --> 04:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
to another I believe human somebody may
 
04:40:11.310 --> 04:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
be able to correct me on that um there
 
04:40:11.320 --> 04:40:12.390 align:start position:0%
be able to correct me on that um there
there

04:40:12.390 --> 04:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:40:16.830 --> 04:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
are that that's a big big subject this
 
04:40:19.030 --> 04:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
is a lightning rod and my intent is to
 
04:40:22.390 --> 04:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
not stir that pot he asked me for some
 
04:40:25.270 --> 04:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
detail okay
 
04:40:27.310 --> 04:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
um without
 
04:40:31.510 --> 04:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
question there are tests nonhuman tests
 
04:40:37.590 --> 04:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
that confirm CWD can cross species
 
04:40:40.990 --> 04:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
now they haven't done that in a human
 
04:40:41.000 --> 04:40:42.190 align:start position:0%
now they haven't done that in a human
yet

04:40:42.190 --> 04:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
yet
 
04:40:45.070 --> 04:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
but I will tell you that funding doesn't
 
04:40:48.350 --> 04:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
exist for those
 
04:40:51.390 --> 04:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
tests last followup thank you Mr uh
 
04:40:53.670 --> 04:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
chairman so I'm just trying to get this
 
04:40:58.190 --> 04:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
straight so there are no reported cases
 
04:41:01.230 --> 04:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
of hunters or anybody who have eaten
 
04:41:04.628 --> 04:41:04.638 align:start position:0%
served meat coming down with there are
 
04:41:07.750 --> 04:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
plenty of cases where I didn't get that
 
04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:17.788 --> 04:41:17.798 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of cases that are
 
04:41:20.868 --> 04:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
suspect um there was actually a girl in
 
04:41:22.390 --> 04:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
Maine in
 
04:41:26.628 --> 04:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
1997 that um there's a
 
04:41:32.390 --> 04:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
CDC scientist Dr ble that researched
 
04:41:36.150 --> 04:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
that one there's several other cases
 
04:41:41.510 --> 04:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
where there have been groups in uh
 
04:41:44.788 --> 04:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
feasts like Hunter harvested feasts you
 
04:41:47.230 --> 04:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
know a group of 10 people and all of a
 
04:41:50.670 --> 04:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
sudden two of them die from variant
 
04:41:54.670 --> 04:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
kutzel Jacob variant is different than
 
04:41:58.230 --> 04:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
the sporadic form of crutz Feld
 
04:41:58.240 --> 04:41:59.910 align:start position:0%
the sporadic form of crutz Feld
Jacob

04:41:59.910 --> 04:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
Jacob
 
04:42:03.708 --> 04:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
um that again is a lightning rod I don't
 
04:42:07.030 --> 04:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get into that that
 
04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to
 
04:42:12.628 --> 04:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
protect there um
 
04:42:14.990 --> 04:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's not why I'm here I don't want to
 
04:42:16.990 --> 04:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
be in the middle of that discussion or
 
04:42:17.000 --> 04:42:18.470 align:start position:0%
be in the middle of that discussion or
that

04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
debate representative
 
04:42:23.868 --> 04:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
Khan thank you Mr chairman uh
 
04:42:25.390 --> 04:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
04:42:25.400 --> 04:42:26.948 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
questions

04:42:26.948 --> 04:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:42:30.470 --> 04:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh I'm looking at your bill I cannot
 
04:42:34.750 --> 04:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
find anywhere it says deer it says
 
04:42:38.830 --> 04:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
meat oh okay so what my question is if
 
04:42:42.830 --> 04:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
we you know have to test all this meat
 
04:42:44.670 --> 04:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
comes into the
 
04:42:47.470 --> 04:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
near the department need lot of
 
04:42:50.270 --> 04:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
resources you know it needs a you know
 
04:42:54.150 --> 04:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
extra Manpower and all these
 
04:42:57.030 --> 04:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
things uh the the question came up with
 
04:42:59.750 --> 04:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
o was how do we enforce
 
04:43:02.390 --> 04:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
it because someone goes to Pennsylvania
 
04:43:04.670 --> 04:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
or other state that's known
 
04:43:06.830 --> 04:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
CWD how do we enforce it but you know
 
04:43:09.470 --> 04:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
the funny thing about hunters and I
 
04:43:11.788 --> 04:43:11.798 align:start position:0%
think I heard it in the previous bill is
 
04:43:14.510 --> 04:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
they like to talk about what they
 
04:43:17.230 --> 04:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
shot so then the question becomes is
 
04:43:20.350 --> 04:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
amongst the neighbors or other Shooters
 
04:43:23.670 --> 04:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
did they get it tested and if they
 
04:43:25.628 --> 04:43:25.638 align:start position:0%
didn't then it will eventually get to
 
04:43:28.110 --> 04:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
Colonel Gordon or Corner Gordon's crewp
 
04:43:31.670 --> 04:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
over there um and it'll eventually sort
 
04:43:34.270 --> 04:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
of work its way through so I think the
 
04:43:36.628 --> 04:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
issue then becomes is how to enforce it
 
04:43:38.788 --> 04:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
is I think it'll be self- enforcing
 
04:43:41.110 --> 04:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
after a while people will know that if
 
04:43:42.868 --> 04:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
you hunt outside of the State of New
 
04:43:45.470 --> 04:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you bring the servant in
 
04:43:48.270 --> 04:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:50.510 --> 04:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
tested any other
 
04:43:52.670 --> 04:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
04:43:56.868 --> 04:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
time today thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:43:59.190 --> 04:43:59.200 align:start position:0%

for the department and the commission
 
04:44:44.190 --> 04:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
and opposition of this bill um one point
 
04:44:46.030 --> 04:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
of clarification so the department
 
04:44:48.390 --> 04:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
actually already does post a list of CWD
 
04:44:50.030 --> 04:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
positive jurisdictions on our website
 
04:44:51.270 --> 04:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
we've been doing that for a number of
 
04:44:53.788 --> 04:44:53.798 align:start position:0%
years um it's also in our digest with a
 
04:44:55.390 --> 04:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
reference to to make sure you check the
 
04:44:57.190 --> 04:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
website because again these positive
 
04:44:59.470 --> 04:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
States unfortunately pop up fairly
 
04:45:01.550 --> 04:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
regularly um so we're constantly
 
04:45:04.430 --> 04:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
updating that list as we as we get word
 
04:45:07.470 --> 04:45:07.480 align:start position:0%
um the department feels this is um is
 
04:45:11.190 --> 04:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily restrictive um so we do
 
04:45:13.230 --> 04:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
have restrictions in regards to what
 
04:45:14.830 --> 04:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
Hunters are allowed to bring back into
 
04:45:16.990 --> 04:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
the state um when they harvest a served
 
04:45:18.708 --> 04:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
so a servid is any member of the deer
 
04:45:21.150 --> 04:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
family so that's white tail deer moose
 
04:45:22.910 --> 04:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
mule deer so obviously New Hampshire
 
04:45:25.948 --> 04:45:25.958 align:start position:0%
it's whail deer and and um and moose but
 
04:45:27.350 --> 04:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
people go to other states they hunt mu
 
04:45:29.910 --> 04:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
deer they hunt elk and most of these
 
04:45:32.430 --> 04:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
animals are susceptible to getting
 
04:45:35.150 --> 04:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
CWD um our current
 
04:45:37.628 --> 04:45:37.638 align:start position:0%
restrictions um what you are allowed to
 
04:45:39.510 --> 04:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
bring back in so so the way we restrict
 
04:45:42.270 --> 04:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
it is if a hunter goes to a CWD positive
 
04:45:43.948 --> 04:45:43.958 align:start position:0%
state which they can identify by going
 
04:45:46.390 --> 04:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
to our website they're allowed to bring
 
04:45:50.110 --> 04:45:50.120 align:start position:0%
back in deboned meat antlers antlers
 
04:45:51.948 --> 04:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
attached to skull caps with all the soft
 
04:45:54.470 --> 04:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
tissue removed um upper canine teeth
 
04:45:56.628 --> 04:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
with all the soft tissue removed hides
 
04:45:58.470 --> 04:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
or capes with no parts of the head
 
04:46:01.110 --> 04:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
attached um finished Taxidermy mounts
 
04:46:02.868 --> 04:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
and then tissues prepared and packaged
 
04:46:05.030 --> 04:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
for use by diagnostic Research
 
04:46:07.708 --> 04:46:07.718 align:start position:0%
Laboratories um we allow these in
 
04:46:10.110 --> 04:46:10.120 align:start position:0%
because we consider these lowrisk um
 
04:46:15.628 --> 04:46:15.638 align:start position:0%
tissues um as was stated before um as as
 
04:46:17.670 --> 04:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
testing methods have evolved over time
 
04:46:19.830 --> 04:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
and become more sensitive um there's
 
04:46:22.990 --> 04:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
ways to amplify um amplify the the the
 
04:46:25.750 --> 04:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
samples um prons are basically
 
04:46:28.390 --> 04:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
everywhere um they find them in in
 
04:46:29.750 --> 04:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
virtually every tissue that they've
 
04:46:32.750 --> 04:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
looked in um they as was referenced they
 
04:46:34.868 --> 04:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
found them in ticks they also find that
 
04:46:36.230 --> 04:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
certain plants will take them up in
 
04:46:39.548 --> 04:46:39.558 align:start position:0%
their Roots um the big question is what
 
04:46:42.270 --> 04:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
is the risk associ ated with these
 
04:46:44.150 --> 04:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
preons and what are the different preon
 
04:46:48.590 --> 04:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
levels um it's not completely welln what
 
04:46:50.830 --> 04:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
is in you know quote unquote infective
 
04:46:54.590 --> 04:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
dose of prons if you will um but most
 
04:46:59.628 --> 04:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
States um consider meat as low risk um
 
04:47:01.628 --> 04:47:01.638 align:start position:0%
So currently so our our deer project
 
04:47:02.830 --> 04:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
leader went through and checked all the
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
regulations in all 50 states um
 
04:47:07.270 --> 04:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
currently there are no states that
 
04:47:09.030 --> 04:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
restrict the importation of meat or
 
04:47:11.830 --> 04:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
require testing of meat um New
 
04:47:13.590 --> 04:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's import restrictions are
 
04:47:15.548 --> 04:47:15.558 align:start position:0%
actually a bit more restrictive than
 
04:47:18.070 --> 04:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
than many other states um other states
 
04:47:21.070 --> 04:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
allow quartered um deer to come back in
 
04:47:23.150 --> 04:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
some states have no restriction um you
 
04:47:25.270 --> 04:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
can bring you can bring anything back in
 
04:47:27.150 --> 04:47:27.160 align:start position:0%
even if it's a CWD positive State
 
04:47:28.868 --> 04:47:28.878 align:start position:0%
there's only a handful of those at this
 
04:47:30.670 --> 04:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
point um but but our current
 
04:47:32.110 --> 04:47:32.120 align:start position:0%
restrictions are actually more
 
04:47:34.230 --> 04:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
restrictive than than many other
 
04:47:36.788 --> 04:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
states um again we're our restrictions
 
04:47:39.030 --> 04:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
are more focused on these what we
 
04:47:40.990 --> 04:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
consider high-risk tissues so things
 
04:47:43.510 --> 04:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
like nervous system tissues um brains
 
04:47:46.030 --> 04:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
lymph nodes spleen um there's been
 
04:47:48.788 --> 04:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
research that has shown um there was one
 
04:47:51.190 --> 04:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
study that showed the preon levels in
 
04:47:53.350 --> 04:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
muscle tissue was you know 2,000 to
 
04:47:55.948 --> 04:47:55.958 align:start position:0%
10,000 times less than what they find in
 
04:47:58.548 --> 04:47:58.558 align:start position:0%
brain tissue um so the current belief
 
04:48:00.670 --> 04:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
although it is concerning that there
 
04:48:02.270 --> 04:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
that we are detecting prons and all
 
04:48:05.868 --> 04:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
these tissues um the the current um the
 
04:48:08.390 --> 04:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
current knowledge is is that these are
 
04:48:10.350 --> 04:48:10.360 align:start position:0%
still low-risk tissues and likely not a
 
04:48:12.548 --> 04:48:12.558 align:start position:0%
big risk R for transmission of the
 
04:48:15.910 --> 04:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
disease um another difference with
 
04:48:17.230 --> 04:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
allowing Hunters to bring back
 
04:48:19.390 --> 04:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
particularly deboned meat um the
 
04:48:21.150 --> 04:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
assumption is is that that individual is
 
04:48:23.430 --> 04:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
going to consume that right so you're
 
04:48:25.708 --> 04:48:25.718 align:start position:0%
already somewhat contained that that
 
04:48:28.270 --> 04:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
meat comes back and it get it gets
 
04:48:30.948 --> 04:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
consumed or um in the in the event
 
04:48:32.470 --> 04:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't like it it doesn't taste
 
04:48:35.270 --> 04:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
good it goes bad hopefully and and maybe
 
04:48:36.350 --> 04:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
this is something we should do more
 
04:48:37.628 --> 04:48:37.638 align:start position:0%
education on but hopefully that
 
04:48:39.350 --> 04:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
individual would dispose of that in the
 
04:48:42.190 --> 04:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
garbage um that goes to a landfill which
 
04:48:45.350 --> 04:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
is actually um an approved method for
 
04:48:48.548 --> 04:48:48.558 align:start position:0%
disposing of CWD positive known CWD
 
04:48:51.390 --> 04:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
positive tissues um a lot of states will
 
04:48:53.590 --> 04:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
landfill um they'll typically landfill
 
04:48:55.750 --> 04:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
or incinerate to to dispose the to
 
04:48:58.310 --> 04:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
dispose of positive
 
04:48:58.320 --> 04:49:00.350 align:start position:0%
dispose of positive
tissues

04:49:00.350 --> 04:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
tissues
 
04:49:03.030 --> 04:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
um in in terms of availability of
 
04:49:06.788 --> 04:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
testing um so again there's there's
 
04:49:08.390 --> 04:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
constant research going on on better
 
04:49:12.350 --> 04:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
ways to detect prons um
 
04:49:14.830 --> 04:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
as these things develop um that's good
 
04:49:16.708 --> 04:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
there there's they're looking at live
 
04:49:19.310 --> 04:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
animal tests which is which is positive
 
04:49:21.788 --> 04:49:21.798 align:start position:0%
um currently none of these other newer
 
04:49:24.670 --> 04:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
forms of testing have Federal standards
 
04:49:27.548 --> 04:49:27.558 align:start position:0%
um so we do on an annual basis we do um
 
04:49:30.150 --> 04:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
CWD surveillance in the state um so our
 
04:49:31.708 --> 04:49:31.718 align:start position:0%
biologists will collect the heads of
 
04:49:33.548 --> 04:49:33.558 align:start position:0%
Hunter harvested deer from within New
 
04:49:35.990 --> 04:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from butchers um we remove
 
04:49:37.708 --> 04:49:37.718 align:start position:0%
lymph nodes and we send those to a lab
 
04:49:41.670 --> 04:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
for testing um if those samples if any
 
04:49:43.110 --> 04:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
of those samples were to come back
 
04:49:45.910 --> 04:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
positive um they then rerun a sample to
 
04:49:48.788 --> 04:49:48.798 align:start position:0%
confirm that in fact um there was a
 
04:49:52.150 --> 04:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
positive and these tests um are all
 
04:49:55.868 --> 04:49:55.878 align:start position:0%
certified through through USDA um so one
 
04:49:58.310 --> 04:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
of the issues is one there's there's
 
04:50:01.230 --> 04:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
really no certified tests for meat at
 
04:50:05.350 --> 04:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
this time um there's not a lot of um I'm
 
04:50:07.830 --> 04:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
our our biologist was able to locate one
 
04:50:09.628 --> 04:50:09.638 align:start position:0%
um facility that did offer testing of
 
04:50:11.590 --> 04:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
meat um but again there's no federal
 
04:50:14.510 --> 04:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
standards for that there's no way to um
 
04:50:16.230 --> 04:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
you know get confirmation of what those
 
04:50:19.390 --> 04:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
results are um we don't know what weight
 
04:50:21.070 --> 04:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
times would be so you could run into
 
04:50:23.270 --> 04:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
instances where um you know a hunter
 
04:50:25.470 --> 04:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
goes to another state he goes to have
 
04:50:27.270 --> 04:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
his meat tested you know does that meat
 
04:50:30.510 --> 04:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
stay in a freezer for weeks or months um
 
04:50:32.030 --> 04:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
until they find out the results and then
 
04:50:33.350 --> 04:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
they have to go back to the state to
 
04:50:34.670 --> 04:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
retrieve the
 
04:50:38.230 --> 04:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
meat um so so these are all questions we
 
04:50:41.590 --> 04:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
have of how this would function um
 
04:50:44.750 --> 04:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
testing um testing is is is pretty
 
04:50:47.868 --> 04:50:47.878 align:start position:0%
expensive um um particularly if you were
 
04:50:49.750 --> 04:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
going to consider doing it at that level
 
04:50:53.390 --> 04:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
and that scale um so so we certainly
 
04:50:55.070 --> 04:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
have some concerns about how that might
 
04:50:57.110 --> 04:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
function where Hunters might get the
 
04:50:59.390 --> 04:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
tests um um the fact that there are no
 
04:51:01.948 --> 04:51:01.958 align:start position:0%
federal standards for the tests um who's
 
04:51:04.708 --> 04:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
going to pay for this um all for a
 
04:51:06.990 --> 04:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
tissue that that currently is considered
 
04:51:11.548 --> 04:51:11.558 align:start position:0%
low risk for transmission um the the
 
04:51:13.030 --> 04:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
association of Fish and Wildlife
 
04:51:14.948 --> 04:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
agencies um which New Hampshire fishing
 
04:51:18.070 --> 04:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
game is a part of um they have um they
 
04:51:20.910 --> 04:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
have a document um it's
 
04:51:23.470 --> 04:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
a it's best man it's a best management
 
04:51:26.230 --> 04:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
practice document for CWD they still
 
04:51:28.830 --> 04:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
consider live animal movement um the
 
04:51:30.548 --> 04:51:30.558 align:start position:0%
greatest risk for CWD so it was
 
04:51:32.070 --> 04:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
referenced that there's other states and
 
04:51:36.628 --> 04:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
there's um substantially more um CWD
 
04:51:38.430 --> 04:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
positive animals found in in wild
 
04:51:41.070 --> 04:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
animals um and that's true but the
 
04:51:43.350 --> 04:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
reason for that is there are
 
04:51:45.510 --> 04:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
substantially more wild animals on the
 
04:51:48.150 --> 04:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
landscape um there's been many many
 
04:51:50.310 --> 04:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
documented cases um and they can they
 
04:51:52.230 --> 04:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
can do this because captive facilities
 
04:51:55.590 --> 04:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
have to keep records of movement um they
 
04:51:58.310 --> 04:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
can do Trace back um you know Trace back
 
04:52:00.670 --> 04:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
from the herd of origin they can track
 
04:52:03.030 --> 04:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
how this disease has moved around um
 
04:52:05.470 --> 04:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
from these captive animals um so it's
 
04:52:07.868 --> 04:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
been very well documented that captive
 
04:52:09.948 --> 04:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
animals are are the greatest risk for
 
04:52:12.310 --> 04:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
the spread of of this disease and it
 
04:52:13.910 --> 04:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
would make sense right because these
 
04:52:16.030 --> 04:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
animals have all the body tissues
 
04:52:17.708 --> 04:52:17.718 align:start position:0%
they're alive they're continually
 
04:52:20.270 --> 04:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
shedding these these proteins into the
 
04:52:23.708 --> 04:52:23.718 align:start position:0%
environment there's escapes um these
 
04:52:26.548 --> 04:52:26.558 align:start position:0%
these proteins are um as was referenced
 
04:52:28.350 --> 04:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
they're very stable they can last in the
 
04:52:32.150 --> 04:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
environment for years um and and it does
 
04:52:33.990 --> 04:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
take a while for them to to show
 
04:52:37.270 --> 04:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
themselves so um one good example um so
 
04:52:41.150 --> 04:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
New York State um in 2005 um it detected
 
04:52:43.590 --> 04:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
its first um CWD positive animal in a
 
04:52:47.390 --> 04:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
captive facility and then in Wild deer
 
04:52:49.628 --> 04:52:49.638 align:start position:0%
um they spent you know over a million
 
04:52:52.750 --> 04:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
dollars to do Advanced um culling and
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
surveillance um they were at the time
 
04:52:57.110 --> 04:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
believed to be the only state to to
 
04:53:00.628 --> 04:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
effectively um get rid of CWD as it were
 
04:53:03.270 --> 04:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
um and just this past year um they found
 
04:53:05.868 --> 04:53:05.878 align:start position:0%
another positive in a captive facility
 
04:53:07.510 --> 04:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
um the closest that this has been
 
04:53:10.030 --> 04:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
detected to New Hampshire was in Quebec
 
04:53:12.750 --> 04:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
um again in a captive facility um of I
 
04:53:15.628 --> 04:53:15.638 align:start position:0%
think it was red deer um Quebec spent
 
04:53:17.230 --> 04:53:17.240 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars to bring in a
 
04:53:20.110 --> 04:53:20.120 align:start position:0%
company to um call Wild deer around the
 
04:53:22.430 --> 04:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
captive facility um fortunately they did
 
04:53:25.910 --> 04:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
not find any CWD um in those in any of
 
04:53:29.030 --> 04:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
the wild deer um which is a big concern
 
04:53:31.548 --> 04:53:31.558 align:start position:0%
to us that that um I believe that
 
04:53:33.470 --> 04:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
facility was only about 100 miles from
 
04:53:35.948 --> 04:53:35.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um but again it highlights
 
04:53:39.470 --> 04:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
the the risk of of captive animals um
 
04:53:41.830 --> 04:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
USDA does do have a certification
 
04:53:45.910 --> 04:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
program for herds um where um captive
 
04:53:47.510 --> 04:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
captive served grower would enroll in
 
04:53:48.990 --> 04:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
this program there's different steps
 
04:53:51.788 --> 04:53:51.798 align:start position:0%
that they take to reduce the risk um and
 
04:53:53.548 --> 04:53:53.558 align:start position:0%
they have to be enrolled in this program
 
04:53:55.868 --> 04:53:55.878 align:start position:0%
for five years to become certified as
 
04:53:59.390 --> 04:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
low risk um however there are problems
 
04:54:02.910 --> 04:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
with this with this um um with this
 
04:54:05.830 --> 04:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
method and um just a highlight so we
 
04:54:08.390 --> 04:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
looked in there's a US Animal Health
 
04:54:11.110 --> 04:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
Association committee on Farm sery day
 
04:54:13.948 --> 04:54:13.958 align:start position:0%
um so in 2021 there were 35 new positive
 
04:54:16.990 --> 04:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
Farm served herds um of those four of
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
the herds were enrolled in the in the
 
04:54:20.708 --> 04:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
certification program and eight were
 
04:54:22.670 --> 04:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
actually considered certified which
 
04:54:25.548 --> 04:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
means they had all their animals had not
 
04:54:27.708 --> 04:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
um had any detectable cases of CWD
 
04:54:30.670 --> 04:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
within a 5-year period so you can see
 
04:54:34.030 --> 04:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
how concerning this is um and the lack
 
04:54:36.628 --> 04:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
of the ability for this program to keep
 
04:54:41.310 --> 04:54:41.320 align:start position:0%
CWD out of estate when you know um
 
04:54:42.868 --> 04:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
captive herds that have been rolled in
 
04:54:44.350 --> 04:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
programs and doing testing and not
 
04:54:47.270 --> 04:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
finding positives um suddenly become
 
04:54:49.868 --> 04:54:49.878 align:start position:0%
positive so that's you know those are
 
04:54:52.990 --> 04:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
our concerns um we have importation
 
04:54:55.868 --> 04:54:55.878 align:start position:0%
restrictions on CWD susceptible servid
 
04:54:57.948 --> 04:54:57.958 align:start position:0%
there's there's virtually only one
 
04:55:00.030 --> 04:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
served species that that you regularly
 
04:55:02.190 --> 04:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
deal with which is phow deer that there
 
04:55:04.670 --> 04:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
has been some experimental um infection
 
04:55:07.350 --> 04:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
but it was the prons were essentially
 
04:55:09.110 --> 04:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
injected directly into the brain stem
 
04:55:10.868 --> 04:55:10.878 align:start position:0%
and even then it was difficult to infect
 
04:55:13.270 --> 04:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
them so those that's a species that is
 
04:55:16.070 --> 04:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
considered um really not susceptible to
 
04:55:19.310 --> 04:55:19.320 align:start position:0%
C CWD we do allow those to be imported
 
04:55:21.390 --> 04:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
um so again you know we we try and look
 
04:55:23.030 --> 04:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
at what the current science is it's
 
04:55:25.310 --> 04:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
constantly evolving um we do need to
 
04:55:28.310 --> 04:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
evolve with that um but again right now
 
04:55:31.030 --> 04:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
we feel that um requiring Hunters to
 
04:55:33.868 --> 04:55:33.878 align:start position:0%
test their meat um is is somewhat
 
04:55:35.868 --> 04:55:35.878 align:start position:0%
unnecessary given that it's still
 
04:55:38.230 --> 04:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
considered meat as a low risk um for
 
04:55:40.590 --> 04:55:40.600 align:start position:0%
spreading the disease thank you I'll
 
04:55:43.548 --> 04:55:43.558 align:start position:0%
take questions are there any
 
04:55:46.910 --> 04:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative Harvey so um I
 
04:55:49.670 --> 04:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
hear you say low risk um how do you
 
04:55:53.390 --> 04:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
determine when something is low medium
 
04:55:56.948 --> 04:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
or high risk I mean when do we get cons
 
04:55:58.788 --> 04:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
in the spectrum of things when does it
 
04:56:02.350 --> 04:56:02.360 align:start position:0%
go from low yeah yeah that that's a good
 
04:56:02.360 --> 04:56:03.948 align:start position:0%
go from low yeah yeah that that's a good
question

04:56:03.948 --> 04:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:56:06.948 --> 04:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
um it's it's largely based off of
 
04:56:12.788 --> 04:56:12.798 align:start position:0%
research um and there's there's been um
 
04:56:14.670 --> 04:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
again there's no good answer to what an
 
04:56:17.948 --> 04:56:17.958 align:start position:0%
infective dose of prons are um so
 
04:56:19.948 --> 04:56:19.958 align:start position:0%
there's unfortunately there's no like
 
04:56:21.270 --> 04:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
you know if you have this number of
 
04:56:25.470 --> 04:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
prons in a tissue um you know that will
 
04:56:28.350 --> 04:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
infect an animal um so so there is
 
04:56:29.788 --> 04:56:29.798 align:start position:0%
there's not a great answer for that
 
04:56:33.590 --> 04:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:37.070 --> 04:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
um other than the levels are so low in
 
04:56:39.590 --> 04:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
these other tissues and it there's the
 
04:56:41.910 --> 04:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
research to St has not suggested that
 
04:56:44.548 --> 04:56:44.558 align:start position:0%
this is a transmission for um or this is
 
04:56:45.868 --> 04:56:45.878 align:start position:0%
a this is
 
04:56:49.350 --> 04:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
a um this is a route for transmission
 
04:56:51.830 --> 04:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
into into
 
04:56:54.110 --> 04:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
animals any other
 
04:56:57.628 --> 04:56:57.638 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
04:57:00.110 --> 04:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
Stone how are you going to prevent
 
04:57:02.030 --> 04:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
people from either State coming in the
 
04:57:04.628 --> 04:57:04.638 align:start position:0%
state with meet from another state or a
 
04:57:06.190 --> 04:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
country how you going to prevent that
 
04:57:08.708 --> 04:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
and regulate it and what is it going to
 
04:57:08.718 --> 04:57:10.430 align:start position:0%
and regulate it and what is it going to
cost

04:57:10.430 --> 04:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:57:14.310 --> 04:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
so it's not easy right um because
 
04:57:16.310 --> 04:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
someone could easily drive through and
 
04:57:18.628 --> 04:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
and you know go to their home and put
 
04:57:20.350 --> 04:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
their meat in their freezer and we'll
 
04:57:22.470 --> 04:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
we'll be none the wiser um that's
 
04:57:23.868 --> 04:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
currently the case though with our
 
04:57:26.310 --> 04:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
certain our current restrictions and we
 
04:57:28.868 --> 04:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
do periodically um we do periodically
 
04:57:30.670 --> 04:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
find people that have brought some of
 
04:57:32.868 --> 04:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
these higher risk tissues into the state
 
04:57:35.070 --> 04:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
um sometimes it's by accident be or Not
 
04:57:36.628 --> 04:57:36.638 align:start position:0%
by accident but they weren't aware of
 
04:57:38.190 --> 04:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
what the regulations were and our law
 
04:57:40.350 --> 04:57:40.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement will work with those um in
 
04:57:42.470 --> 04:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
those instances will'll confiscate those
 
04:57:43.590 --> 04:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
those parts and we'll have them
 
04:57:46.750 --> 04:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
incinerated or brought to a landfill um
 
04:57:50.270 --> 04:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
but yeah it's an issue um sometimes you
 
04:57:51.910 --> 04:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
know you hear from someone else that
 
04:57:53.190 --> 04:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
they know of someone that brought
 
04:57:55.628 --> 04:57:55.638 align:start position:0%
something in sometimes someone realizes
 
04:57:56.708 --> 04:57:56.718 align:start position:0%
that they did something they weren't
 
04:57:58.548 --> 04:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
supposed to and they contact us directly
 
04:58:00.830 --> 04:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
to say oh I wasn't wasn't aware of this
 
04:58:03.390 --> 04:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
and they self-report um but it's a good
 
04:58:05.190 --> 04:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
question you know we can't have we can't
 
04:58:07.070 --> 04:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
have um conservation officers at the
 
04:58:09.190 --> 04:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
borders checking trucks for serving
 
04:58:11.110 --> 04:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
meate from other states so it's going to
 
04:58:13.310 --> 04:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
be pretty much impossible follow up
 
04:58:14.910 --> 04:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
basically you know what I mean to try to
 
04:58:17.270 --> 04:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
regulate this is going to you know you
 
04:58:19.190 --> 04:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
can't stop every cover Tower and trck
 
04:58:21.270 --> 04:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
comes in the state it it would be
 
04:58:22.830 --> 04:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
difficult it
 
04:58:25.270 --> 04:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
very any other
 
04:58:27.470 --> 04:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
04:58:30.270 --> 04:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
time today thank you seeing no other uh
 
04:58:34.070 --> 04:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
speakers on this bill I will close the

opportunity to present House Bill 202 um

I'm so lucky that I got to be the last
 
04:59:22.430 --> 04:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
bill after a very long day you maybe
 
04:59:24.868 --> 04:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
you'll remember me um I represent

Morland um I I've been on the fishing
 
04:59:38.628 --> 04:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
game committee for nine years now and um
 
04:59:40.070 --> 04:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
as a member of the fishing game
 
04:59:42.670 --> 04:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
committee I have attended many of
 
04:59:45.470 --> 04:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
Fishing Game Commission meetings um the
 
04:59:48.350 --> 04:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
only in fact in the nine years that I've
 
04:59:50.830 --> 04:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
been there um I can tell you with great
 
04:59:53.270 --> 04:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
certainty that myself representative
 
04:59:55.628 --> 04:59:55.638 align:start position:0%
Jacobs and Representative Bob laroo are
 
04:59:57.070 --> 04:59:57.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much the only ones that attend
 
04:59:59.830 --> 04:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
those meetings uh the commission if if
 
05:00:02.628 --> 05:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
you're not sure because you're new um
 
05:00:07.230 --> 05:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
how it it's a um uh set up
 
05:00:10.628 --> 05:00:10.638 align:start position:0%
the the commission has 11 members one
 
05:00:12.628 --> 05:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
from each region of the state and the
 
05:00:17.190 --> 05:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
11th is from the Sea Coast um underneath
 
05:00:21.788 --> 05:00:21.798 align:start position:0%
them is the director of fishing game in
 
05:00:25.590 --> 05:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
other words um 11 Commissioners oversee
 
05:00:27.310 --> 05:00:27.320 align:start position:0%
the director of the
 
05:00:29.788 --> 05:00:29.798 align:start position:0%
department I don't know of any other
 
05:00:32.510 --> 05:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
organization that is set up this way
 
05:00:35.830 --> 05:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
there's always one person at the top one
 
05:00:39.190 --> 05:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
director one CEO one speaker of the
 
05:00:42.548 --> 05:00:42.558 align:start position:0%
house one chairman of our committee um
 
05:00:45.670 --> 05:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
one superintendent of schools Etc um and
 
05:00:50.110 --> 05:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
all others work in consultation and in
 
05:00:55.470 --> 05:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
advisory position to that um head of the
 
05:00:59.110 --> 05:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
department not 11 people at the at the
 
05:01:00.830 --> 05:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
department I can't imagine how that
 
05:01:00.840 --> 05:01:01.708 align:start position:0%
department I can't imagine how that
would

05:01:01.708 --> 05:01:01.718 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:01:03.750 --> 05:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
work in the years that I've been
 
05:01:05.310 --> 05:01:05.320 align:start position:0%
attending Fishing Game Commission
 
05:01:08.750 --> 05:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
meetings I've noticed that this setup
 
05:01:11.190 --> 05:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
has some inefficiency in it and that's
 
05:01:14.990 --> 05:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
what prompted me to submit this bill um
 
05:01:17.510 --> 05:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's kind of important that we
 
05:01:19.910 --> 05:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
understand what this bill is not as well
 
05:01:22.628 --> 05:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
as what this bill is uh first of all
 
05:01:26.150 --> 05:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
this is not a partisan bill um I did
 
05:01:28.110 --> 05:01:28.120 align:start position:0%
receive an email that said Commissioners
 
05:01:29.830 --> 05:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
serve as a check and balance to a
 
05:01:33.230 --> 05:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
politically appointed director uh who is
 
05:01:36.548 --> 05:01:36.558 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor but that isn't
 
05:01:38.990 --> 05:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
really a balance because that is exactly
 
05:01:41.310 --> 05:01:41.320 align:start position:0%
how the commissioner are appointed as
 
05:01:44.030 --> 05:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
well they are nominated by Sportsman's
 
05:01:47.350 --> 05:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
clubs they are appointed by the governor
 
05:01:50.190 --> 05:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
and they're approved by the executive
 
05:01:52.708 --> 05:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
committee the same way that the the
 
05:01:55.190 --> 05:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
director is um
 
05:01:58.350 --> 05:01:58.360 align:start position:0%
done and that was explained to us last
 
05:02:00.548 --> 05:02:00.558 align:start position:0%
week when commissioner Kavanagh talked
 
05:02:02.868 --> 05:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
about his interview process with the
 
05:02:02.878 --> 05:02:03.910 align:start position:0%
about his interview process with the
executive

05:02:03.910 --> 05:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
executive
 
05:02:06.788 --> 05:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
committee second of all this bill does
 
05:02:10.788 --> 05:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
not suggest any change to the commission
 
05:02:13.708 --> 05:02:13.718 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any recommendation of
 
05:02:17.070 --> 05:02:17.080 align:start position:0%
Hunter versus uh non-consumptive users
 
05:02:19.868 --> 05:02:19.878 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any change in the makeup
 
05:02:22.990 --> 05:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
of the commission at all it's the same
 
05:02:25.350 --> 05:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
commission the commission still would be
 
05:02:27.590 --> 05:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
required to adhere to the North American
 
05:02:30.190 --> 05:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
model of wildlife conservation which
 
05:02:33.270 --> 05:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
we've heard talked about today and the
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
commission would still be absolutely
 
05:02:38.430 --> 05:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
invaluable to the director in offering
 
05:02:40.510 --> 05:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
guidance and
 
05:02:40.520 --> 05:02:42.150 align:start position:0%
guidance and
um

05:02:42.150 --> 05:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:45.708 --> 05:02:45.718 align:start position:0%
um advisement and guidance to the the
 
05:02:48.110 --> 05:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
director of the um
 
05:02:51.510 --> 05:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
Department this is a bill that would
 
05:02:53.750 --> 05:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
provide some efficiency to the
 
05:02:56.190 --> 05:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
department by setting the director as
 
05:02:58.350 --> 05:02:58.360 align:start position:0%
head of the department and the cons uh
 
05:03:00.628 --> 05:03:00.638 align:start position:0%
Commissioners as advisers and
 
05:03:02.990 --> 05:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
Consultants um as I've attended these
 
05:03:05.670 --> 05:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
meetings over the nine years I've seen
 
05:03:07.830 --> 05:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
several missed opportunities that that
 
05:03:09.948 --> 05:03:09.958 align:start position:0%
really would have benefited are
 
05:03:12.670 --> 05:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
Sportsmen a great deal the Commissioners
 
05:03:15.990 --> 05:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
meet uh once a month for usually about
 
05:03:18.670 --> 05:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
two hours and they need to come to some
 
05:03:21.030 --> 05:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
sort of majority agreement before an
 
05:03:24.510 --> 05:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
action can take place that can be
 
05:03:28.030 --> 05:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes a very slow process um and in
 
05:03:32.510 --> 05:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
two areas it is a critically slow
 
05:03:37.070 --> 05:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
process that have um provided missed
 
05:03:39.150 --> 05:03:39.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities for our Sportsmen the
 
05:03:41.910 --> 05:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
first is uh the acquisition of land and
 
05:03:45.590 --> 05:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
water access um in the acquisition of
 
05:03:48.350 --> 05:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
land and water access um a possible
 
05:03:49.990 --> 05:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
acquisition is brought before the
 
05:03:52.350 --> 05:03:52.360 align:start position:0%
commission uh before the 11 boards and
 
05:03:54.788 --> 05:03:54.798 align:start position:0%
it's discussed invariably there's
 
05:03:56.430 --> 05:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
questions that are ask and there should
 
05:03:58.110 --> 05:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
be questions because sometimes there's
 
05:04:01.030 --> 05:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
an expensive price tag with that
 
05:04:04.030 --> 05:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
purchase um and then because there's
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
questions the a the action is tabled to
 
05:04:09.190 --> 05:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
another month when there might be more
 
05:04:10.910 --> 05:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
questions and then it's tabled to
 
05:04:12.510 --> 05:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
another month when there might be more
 
05:04:15.670 --> 05:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
questions and so forth um the director
 
05:04:18.670 --> 05:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
does not have the power to enter into
 
05:04:19.830 --> 05:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
even a
 
05:04:23.230 --> 05:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
provisional um agreement with the person
 
05:04:26.350 --> 05:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
who is offering the land in
 
05:04:30.350 --> 05:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
2023 I watched 500 Acres of conservation
 
05:04:33.670 --> 05:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
land be tabled for so long that the land
 
05:04:36.470 --> 05:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
was eventually donated or sold to
 
05:04:40.110 --> 05:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
another agency and this is land that our
 
05:04:42.670 --> 05:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
hunters and our Anglers and our Trappers
 
05:04:44.628 --> 05:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
could have been using for three years
 
05:04:47.110 --> 05:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
but it was a missed opportunity because
 
05:04:50.628 --> 05:04:50.638 align:start position:0%
the committee H by definition has to
 
05:04:50.638 --> 05:04:52.430 align:start position:0%
the committee H by definition has to
work

05:04:52.430 --> 05:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
work
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
slowly I've also um watched
 
05:04:58.310 --> 05:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities for water access be lost
 
05:05:02.510 --> 05:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
for the same reasons in 2012 um acre on
 
05:05:06.350 --> 05:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
Alton Bay was lost uh the director had
 
05:05:09.830 --> 05:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
no power to move forward with that and
 
05:05:13.310 --> 05:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
um and so the commissions with without
 
05:05:14.670 --> 05:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
the commission's
 
05:05:17.150 --> 05:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
approval that was 14 years ago that our
 
05:05:19.230 --> 05:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
boers and our swimmers and so forth
 
05:05:22.230 --> 05:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
could have been using that land no new
 
05:05:25.548 --> 05:05:25.558 align:start position:0%
beach has been purchased for 44 years by
 
05:05:28.590 --> 05:05:28.600 align:start position:0%
fishing game and this has reached such a
 
05:05:31.230 --> 05:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
crisis point that some towns like like
 
05:05:33.070 --> 05:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
my own I live in Chesterfield like my
 
05:05:37.390 --> 05:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
own have shut access off to anybody if
 
05:05:39.670 --> 05:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
except those that live in the town
 
05:05:41.948 --> 05:05:41.958 align:start position:0%
there's no room for additional Moorings
 
05:05:45.430 --> 05:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
at many of our Lakes this is um this is
 
05:05:48.150 --> 05:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
a problem that we need to if if the
 
05:05:50.190 --> 05:05:50.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity comes we need to be able to
 
05:05:52.788 --> 05:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
be more agile and to move more
 
05:05:56.788 --> 05:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
efficiently to um to gather that uh to
 
05:05:58.990 --> 05:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
take in that uh land acquisition and
 
05:06:01.830 --> 05:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
water access uh funding as we've heard
 
05:06:05.270 --> 05:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
today is another very deep concern um
 
05:06:08.230 --> 05:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
the director right now has no power to
 
05:06:11.670 --> 05:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
set fees except in consultation with the
 
05:06:13.708 --> 05:06:13.718 align:start position:0%
commission um at the last Commission
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
meeting just last month um there was a
 
05:06:19.948 --> 05:06:19.958 align:start position:0%
question about the RSA because it states
 
05:06:23.948 --> 05:06:23.958 align:start position:0%
that the um fees can be set by the
 
05:06:26.150 --> 05:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
director with
 
05:06:29.270 --> 05:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
consultation with the Commissioners and
 
05:06:31.948 --> 05:06:31.958 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners defined it that last
 
05:06:36.070 --> 05:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
month as approval of the Commissioners I
 
05:06:37.868 --> 05:06:37.878 align:start position:0%
personally think consultation and
 
05:06:40.990 --> 05:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
approval are two different words but the
 
05:06:43.110 --> 05:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
because of that definition that was set
 
05:06:46.470 --> 05:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
just last month the director has no
 
05:06:49.510 --> 05:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
authority to set fees uh there was
 
05:06:53.390 --> 05:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
discussion about a dollar um charge for
 
05:06:56.270 --> 05:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
a boat decal and the director was not
 
05:07:00.788 --> 05:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
able to move forward with that um charge
 
05:07:03.030 --> 05:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
and and this is at a time when funding
 
05:07:06.310 --> 05:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
for fishing game is very crucial um
 
05:07:08.990 --> 05:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
we'll be hearing some bills later on in
 
05:07:11.390 --> 05:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
on the floor about taking money from
 
05:07:13.868 --> 05:07:13.878 align:start position:0%
General funds for retirement and so
 
05:07:21.110 --> 05:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
forth so um RSA 6 colon 10 actually
 
05:07:24.030 --> 05:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
gives the commission the director the
 
05:07:27.270 --> 05:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
authority to set findes in consultation
 
05:07:29.590 --> 05:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
not necessarily with approval of the
 
05:07:32.230 --> 05:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
commission and I believe if we lived up
 
05:07:33.708 --> 05:07:33.718 align:start position:0%
to that
 
05:07:37.390 --> 05:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
RSA uh funding crisis could be averted
 
05:07:39.590 --> 05:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
in a much quicker manner she would have
 
05:07:44.390 --> 05:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
the authority to B to to um manage and
 
05:07:48.510 --> 05:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
um balance her own budget so um last
 
05:07:52.190 --> 05:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
week we also learned that RSA 4-a sets
 
05:07:53.948 --> 05:07:53.958 align:start position:0%
the duties of the fishing game
 
05:07:56.590 --> 05:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioners they are to be stewards of
 
05:07:58.548 --> 05:07:58.558 align:start position:0%
the fish and wildlife and Marine
 
05:08:00.910 --> 05:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
Resources of our state through
 
05:08:03.708 --> 05:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
conservation through longrange planning
 
05:08:06.548 --> 05:08:06.558 align:start position:0%
through acquisition of public access to
 
05:08:10.070 --> 05:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
land and Waters through public educ
 
05:08:13.430 --> 05:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
and through uh proposing legislation all
 
05:08:15.910 --> 05:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
this bill does is simply allow the
 
05:08:18.230 --> 05:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
fishing game to fulfill its Duty and and
 
05:08:19.708 --> 05:08:19.718 align:start position:0%
its mission statement which we also
 
05:08:22.110 --> 05:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
heard last week um in a much more
 
05:08:25.150 --> 05:08:25.160 align:start position:0%
efficient and agile way with the
 
05:08:29.150 --> 05:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
consultation of the Commissioners thank
 
05:08:31.708 --> 05:08:31.718 align:start position:0%
you thank you are there any
 
05:08:33.948 --> 05:08:33.958 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:08:36.070 --> 05:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:08:37.350 --> 05:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
05:08:40.230 --> 05:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
question um correct me if I'm wrong but
 
05:08:41.788 --> 05:08:41.798 align:start position:0%
I understood that you stated that the
 
05:08:43.670 --> 05:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
commission can't move fast enough to
 
05:08:46.708 --> 05:08:46.718 align:start position:0%
make for example land Acquisitions there
 
05:08:49.708 --> 05:08:49.718 align:start position:0%
have been times that they have not um
 
05:08:52.750 --> 05:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
have they have had questions
 
05:08:55.390 --> 05:08:55.400 align:start position:0%
and the motion had to be tabled until
 
05:08:57.310 --> 05:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
the questions could be answered which
 
05:09:01.390 --> 05:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
went on for at least three months in the
 
05:09:05.788 --> 05:09:05.798 align:start position:0%
um one that I actually watched and the
 
05:09:08.708 --> 05:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
family gave the lands to a different
 
05:09:11.390 --> 05:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
agency follow up follow
 
05:09:13.628 --> 05:09:13.638 align:start position:0%
up doesn't the commission have
 
05:09:16.070 --> 05:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility via the chair to meet more
 
05:09:18.470 --> 05:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
often if they determine the necessity to
 
05:09:21.230 --> 05:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
meet to discuss these important matters
 
05:09:23.470 --> 05:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
yes and that would be great but in my uh
 
05:09:25.708 --> 05:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
nine years I've never seen that done
 
05:09:27.590 --> 05:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
05:09:29.750 --> 05:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
05:09:31.910 --> 05:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
time today thank you Mr the chair calls
 
05:09:43.230 --> 05:09:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:45.670 --> 05:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair again Welden Bosworth
 
05:09:49.150 --> 05:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
from Guilford uh I did submit testimony
 
05:09:51.070 --> 05:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
earlier I just want to emphasize a few
 
05:09:53.310 --> 05:09:53.320 align:start position:0%
points here I won't take much of your
 
05:09:56.590 --> 05:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
time the uh change proposed in this bill
 
05:09:59.510 --> 05:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
I think will bring the Fish and Game
 
05:10:01.750 --> 05:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
Commission and Department into line with
 
05:10:04.070 --> 05:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
the best practices followed by a almost
 
05:10:06.230 --> 05:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire agencies and
 
05:10:08.750 --> 05:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
departments and certainly with private
 
05:10:10.628 --> 05:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
corporations where leadership is
 
05:10:14.948 --> 05:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
streamlined for both efficiency and
 
05:10:16.868 --> 05:10:16.878 align:start position:0%
accountability now when the current
 
05:10:18.708 --> 05:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
structure of fishing game was first
 
05:10:22.070 --> 05:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
developed back in 90 years ago in
 
05:10:24.830 --> 05:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
1935 the geographic representation was
 
05:10:26.868 --> 05:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
certainly a practical necessity since
 
05:10:30.670 --> 05:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
with limited communication tools with uh
 
05:10:33.270 --> 05:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
Commissioners from each County ensured
 
05:10:35.788 --> 05:10:35.798 align:start position:0%
representation throughout the state
 
05:10:39.510 --> 05:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
however now in 2025 with high
 
05:10:42.670 --> 05:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
Communications virtual meet meetings and
 
05:10:44.708 --> 05:10:44.718 align:start position:0%
online data readily available the
 
05:10:47.868 --> 05:10:47.878 align:start position:0%
structure is no longer necessary in fact
 
05:10:51.230 --> 05:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
it actively hinders
 
05:10:53.830 --> 05:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
efficiency in my experience and I've
 
05:10:56.430 --> 05:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
been a CEO of a medium-sized company and
 
05:10:58.868 --> 05:10:58.878 align:start position:0%
also a chair of uh a couple of
 
05:11:01.390 --> 05:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
organizations volunteer organizations
 
05:11:04.868 --> 05:11:04.878 align:start position:0%
decision making by committee well one
 
05:11:07.948 --> 05:11:07.958 align:start position:0%
well- intended introduces delays dilutes
 
05:11:11.150 --> 05:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
accountability and creates unnecessary
 
05:11:11.160 --> 05:11:12.948 align:start position:0%
accountability and creates unnecessary
bureaucratic

05:11:12.948 --> 05:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic
 
05:11:16.030 --> 05:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
roadblocks so like things going around
 
05:11:18.150 --> 05:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
here both locally and government uh
 
05:11:20.910 --> 05:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
maybe the time for disruption is here
 
05:11:23.310 --> 05:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
the idea that increases efficiency was
 
05:11:23.320 --> 05:11:24.230 align:start position:0%
the idea that increases efficiency was
well

05:11:24.230 --> 05:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:11:27.430 --> 05:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
addressed by representative Harvey uh it
 
05:11:29.510 --> 05:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
delay takes away the time that spent in
 
05:11:31.190 --> 05:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
scheduling meetings debating and
 
05:11:34.150 --> 05:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
securing consensus with multiple
 
05:11:37.990 --> 05:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
individuals uh it it basically creates a
 
05:11:39.830 --> 05:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
clear accountability which is very
 
05:11:43.110 --> 05:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
timely right now with the uh budget
 
05:11:45.510 --> 05:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
shortfall that's been almost perennial
 
05:11:48.628 --> 05:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
who is accountable for that shortfall
 
05:11:50.190 --> 05:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be nice to point to one
 
05:11:51.788 --> 05:11:51.798 align:start position:0%
person instead of this diffuse
 
05:11:54.708 --> 05:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
organization this committee it also
 
05:11:57.270 --> 05:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
prioritizes ability and expertise over
 
05:12:00.270 --> 05:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
politics Commissioners are politically
 
05:12:03.070 --> 05:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
appointed an executive director is
 
05:12:05.230 --> 05:12:05.240 align:start position:0%
competitively selected through
 
05:12:08.230 --> 05:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
interviews and the whole process of
 
05:12:10.110 --> 05:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
finding the right person
 
05:12:12.070 --> 05:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
so I think now is the time for New
 
05:12:13.948 --> 05:12:13.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to modernize its approach on
 
05:12:16.350 --> 05:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
the fish and game
 
05:12:19.110 --> 05:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
department and I will take any
 
05:12:21.390 --> 05:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
questions are there any
 
05:12:23.548 --> 05:12:23.558 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
05:12:23.558 --> 05:12:24.948 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
time

Hereafter as the fishing game department
 
05:15:29.190 --> 05:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
under a commission to be known as The

Fishing Game Commission commissioner
 
05:15:34.948 --> 05:15:34.958 align:start position:0%
Haron of Marat County and myself are the
 
05:15:36.628 --> 05:15:36.638 align:start position:0%
longest serving Commissioners on the
 
05:15:38.270 --> 05:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
present commission we were both
 
05:15:40.390 --> 05:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
confirmed in
 
05:15:43.230 --> 05:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
2017 this is the third or fourth time
 
05:15:45.628 --> 05:15:45.638 align:start position:0%
that I have seen a similar Bill since
 
05:15:47.628 --> 05:15:47.638 align:start position:0%
I've been on the commission which is
 
05:15:50.990 --> 05:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
just short of 8 years this bill seeks to
 
05:15:53.030 --> 05:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
change many rsas that have been in
 
05:15:55.590 --> 05:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
practice for several years the process
 
05:15:57.470 --> 05:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
that is in use today and has been for
 
05:16:01.628 --> 05:16:01.638 align:start position:0%
many years is working just fine 1869 the
 
05:16:04.510 --> 05:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
commission was created 1935 the fish and
 
05:16:06.430 --> 05:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
gain Department was created under a
 
05:16:08.548 --> 05:16:08.558 align:start position:0%
commission when I first joined the
 
05:16:12.270 --> 05:16:12.280 align:start position:0%
commission in 20177 I remember one of my
 
05:16:13.670 --> 05:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
first commission
 
05:16:16.350 --> 05:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
meetings the the commission sets up in
 
05:16:21.070 --> 05:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
front on a table I looked down the table
 
05:16:22.510 --> 05:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
the commissioner where the Commissioners
 
05:16:23.948 --> 05:16:23.958 align:start position:0%
were sitting and I noticed two
 
05:16:26.510 --> 05:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioners sound
 
05:16:28.510 --> 05:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
asleep how
 
05:16:30.948 --> 05:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
embarrassing I I said to myself what am
 
05:16:33.590 --> 05:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
I getting into I assure you that that is
 
05:16:36.750 --> 05:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
not the case of the commission today it
 
05:16:38.868 --> 05:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
appears to me the sponsors feel that the
 
05:16:40.150 --> 05:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
fishing game Commissioners that are
 
05:16:42.990 --> 05:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
serving today are not the best during my
 
05:16:44.670 --> 05:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
tenure on the commission I have
 
05:16:46.430 --> 05:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
witnessed a major
 
05:16:49.628 --> 05:16:49.638 align:start position:0%
change in the caliber of Commissioners
 
05:16:51.750 --> 05:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
the education of Commissioners in recent
 
05:16:54.868 --> 05:16:54.878 align:start position:0%
times is amazing the education degrees
 
05:16:57.548 --> 05:16:57.558 align:start position:0%
that consists of Forestry Wildlife
 
05:17:00.310 --> 05:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
Management International Affairs geology
 
05:17:02.628 --> 05:17:02.638 align:start position:0%

05:17:05.350 --> 05:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
civil engineering criminal justice
 
05:17:08.110 --> 05:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
microbiology we have two saltwater
 
05:17:09.750 --> 05:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
commercial fishermen on the commission
 
05:17:14.070 --> 05:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
as well we police our own there is an
 
05:17:16.310 --> 05:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
RSA that states no member of the fishing
 
05:17:18.548 --> 05:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
gain commission may be engaged or
 
05:17:20.990 --> 05:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
involved in any Personnel matters of the
 
05:17:22.830 --> 05:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
department including the hiring
 
05:17:26.310 --> 05:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
discipline disciplining firing promoting
 
05:17:28.430 --> 05:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
evaluating transferring and any other
 
05:17:30.628 --> 05:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
matters associated with the certified
 
05:17:33.230 --> 05:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
employees of the department goes on to
 
05:17:34.868 --> 05:17:34.878 align:start position:0%
say that if a complaint is made against
 
05:17:37.270 --> 05:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
a commissioner there shall be a hearing
 
05:17:39.990 --> 05:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
we recently just had one such hearing I
 
05:17:41.510 --> 05:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
think I told you this last week when I
 
05:17:43.390 --> 05:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
was in front of you with the assistance
 
05:17:45.510 --> 05:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
of the Attorney General's office it was
 
05:17:47.150 --> 05:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
determined that the commissioner did in
 
05:17:49.830 --> 05:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
fact violate the law we recommended to
 
05:17:51.708 --> 05:17:51.718 align:start position:0%
the governor and counsel which is the
 
05:17:54.470 --> 05:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
process that the commissioner be removed
 
05:17:56.350 --> 05:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
prior to that the commissioner did
 
05:17:58.750 --> 05:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
resign during our commission meeting we
 
05:18:01.788 --> 05:18:01.798 align:start position:0%
set aside time on the in the agenda to
 
05:18:03.708 --> 05:18:03.718 align:start position:0%
the hearing of the public some of the
 
05:18:05.628 --> 05:18:05.638 align:start position:0%
time we are hearing from individuals
 
05:18:07.310 --> 05:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
that disagree with the work at our
 
05:18:10.190 --> 05:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
professional biologist like Dan oh I
 
05:18:12.788 --> 05:18:12.798 align:start position:0%
just Dan left
 
05:18:15.350 --> 05:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh disagree with some of the work of our
 
05:18:17.830 --> 05:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
professional biolog some disagree with
 
05:18:19.470 --> 05:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
some of the positions the commission has
 
05:18:21.910 --> 05:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
taken on these issues most compliment
 
05:18:23.430 --> 05:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
the commission and the department for
 
05:18:26.590 --> 05:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
doing the job as well as they do this
 
05:18:30.830 --> 05:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
year we had 109 lsis and you all know
 
05:18:32.310 --> 05:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
that's what it is before they get the
 
05:18:35.110 --> 05:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
body of the of the language that we were
 
05:18:38.470 --> 05:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
tracking uh what we do is we meet with
 
05:18:40.628 --> 05:18:40.638 align:start position:0%
with staff we go over each individual
 
05:18:42.270 --> 05:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
one when the language comes out we
 
05:18:44.070 --> 05:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
develop well we're going to support it
 
05:18:46.310 --> 05:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to and and the commission
 
05:18:48.350 --> 05:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
nine times out of 10 if this year it's
 
05:18:50.750 --> 05:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
been 10 times out of 10 we totally agree
 
05:18:52.110 --> 05:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
with what the staff says on
 
05:18:54.670 --> 05:18:54.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations on the
 
05:18:57.150 --> 05:18:57.160 align:start position:0%
bills uh some of the individuals that
 
05:18:58.990 --> 05:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
speak and write to us I honestly believe
 
05:19:00.750 --> 05:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
are preservationists not
 
05:19:02.750 --> 05:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
conservationists they do not believe in
 
05:19:05.270 --> 05:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
killing anything one of the best or
 
05:19:07.310 --> 05:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes the only tool you have is
 
05:19:09.430 --> 05:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
harvest in the excess of a particular
 
05:19:11.868 --> 05:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
Wildlife if this isn't done the habitat
 
05:19:13.510 --> 05:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
will be damaged and mother nature will
 
05:19:16.548 --> 05:19:16.558 align:start position:0%
call call out the excess and it won't be
 
05:19:19.548 --> 05:19:19.558 align:start position:0%
pretty again I am opposed to House Bill
 
05:19:21.868 --> 05:19:21.878 align:start position:0%

Commission I
 
05:20:20.948 --> 05:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose this
 
05:20:23.788 --> 05:20:23.798 align:start position:0%
bill I'm not going to get into all the
 
05:20:26.270 --> 05:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
statis yeah
 
05:20:29.230 --> 05:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
statistics like commissioner SPO did but
 
05:20:32.350 --> 05:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
I want to bring out a few
 
05:20:36.350 --> 05:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
points this bill is to take away all the
 
05:20:39.310 --> 05:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
authorities of the commission it is to
 
05:20:42.670 --> 05:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
make the commission advisory
 
05:20:46.270 --> 05:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
only and that's it advisory
 
05:20:49.030 --> 05:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
only we've heard the history of the
 
05:20:50.990 --> 05:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
commission we've heard what the
 
05:20:53.868 --> 05:20:53.878 align:start position:0%
commission does and now what this bill
 
05:20:55.990 --> 05:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
wants to
 
05:20:59.310 --> 05:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
do Mr bodsworth used the word that I'm
 
05:21:02.590 --> 05:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
going to say he hit it the nail on the
 
05:21:02.600 --> 05:21:05.788 align:start position:0%
going to say he hit it the nail on the
head

05:21:05.788 --> 05:21:05.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:09.788 --> 05:21:09.798 align:start position:0%
destruct he wants to destruct
 
05:21:12.788 --> 05:21:12.798 align:start position:0%
The Fishing Game Commission which will
 
05:21:16.190 --> 05:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
also affect the fishing game
 
05:21:18.470 --> 05:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
department if this Fishing Game
 
05:21:21.670 --> 05:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
Commission goes to advisory only it's
 
05:21:24.548 --> 05:21:24.558 align:start position:0%
like in a past bill that I had said
 
05:21:29.150 --> 05:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
you're leaving it up to one person the
 
05:21:32.548 --> 05:21:32.558 align:start position:0%
director that will be in charge of
 
05:21:34.708 --> 05:21:34.718 align:start position:0%
everything to do with fishing game in
 
05:21:37.310 --> 05:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
the wildlife in the state of New
 
05:21:39.868 --> 05:21:39.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and to put it into a little
 
05:21:41.548 --> 05:21:41.558 align:start position:0%
bit more
 
05:21:45.390 --> 05:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
re more into something we can all
 
05:21:47.948 --> 05:21:47.958 align:start position:0%
understand everybody in this room that
 
05:21:50.788 --> 05:21:50.798 align:start position:0%
is a representative I'm sure you became
 
05:21:50.798 --> 05:21:51.708 align:start position:0%
is a representative I'm sure you became
a

05:21:51.708 --> 05:21:51.718 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:21:54.670 --> 05:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
representative you wanted to M make
 
05:21:58.390 --> 05:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
things better you wanted to make an
 
05:22:02.070 --> 05:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
impact and that's why you ran as a
 
05:22:04.270 --> 05:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
representative my question is would you
 
05:22:07.030 --> 05:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
be a representative if you're only
 
05:22:09.830 --> 05:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
advisor and now other words advisory
 
05:22:13.350 --> 05:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
means I'll give you my opinion but you
 
05:22:16.948 --> 05:22:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:20.390 --> 05:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
it Commissioners are the same
 
05:22:23.470 --> 05:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
way I can honestly sit here and say if
 
05:22:25.030 --> 05:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
this commission went
 
05:22:28.750 --> 05:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
advisory I'll be the first one to walk
 
05:22:32.030 --> 05:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
over that governor's office and resign I
 
05:22:35.390 --> 05:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
find it had every day when I get up why
 
05:22:38.548 --> 05:22:38.558 align:start position:0%
am I even being a commissioner for the
 
05:22:42.190 --> 05:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
amount of time the involvement the
 
05:22:45.868 --> 05:22:45.878 align:start position:0%
heartache the stress that goes into it
 
05:22:48.070 --> 05:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
and you want to take
 
05:22:52.628 --> 05:22:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:55.910 --> 05:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
advisory we have a hard time finding
 
05:22:58.110 --> 05:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioners because a lot of
 
05:23:00.150 --> 05:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I mean people out in the
 
05:23:02.590 --> 05:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
public are starting to realize how much
 
05:23:06.430 --> 05:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
work a commissioner gets involved in how
 
05:23:09.030 --> 05:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
much work and dedication it takes to be
 
05:23:11.750 --> 05:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
a commissioner if you turn around and
 
05:23:15.030 --> 05:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
make this advisory only I don't know
 
05:23:17.670 --> 05:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
anybody that would want to do
 
05:23:21.070 --> 05:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
it and by not having the commission
 
05:23:26.150 --> 05:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:29.310 --> 05:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
heard you right now can go to your
 
05:23:32.190 --> 05:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
county commissioner with any type of
 
05:23:35.750 --> 05:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
problem suggestions ideas or
 
05:23:39.110 --> 05:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
whatever you can go to that commissioner
 
05:23:41.190 --> 05:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
and that commissioner should be bringing
 
05:23:44.190 --> 05:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
it along to the full commission and to
 
05:23:45.708 --> 05:23:45.718 align:start position:0%
fish and
 
05:23:49.628 --> 05:23:49.638 align:start position:0%
game you will lose that right as a
 
05:23:53.070 --> 05:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
person in this state that you now don't
 
05:23:58.270 --> 05:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
have an Avenue directly to fishing
 
05:24:00.708 --> 05:24:00.718 align:start position:0%
game I I I
 
05:24:03.510 --> 05:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
know representative Reed has sit there
 
05:24:06.350 --> 05:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
and talked about land that sometimes
 
05:24:11.310 --> 05:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
land has taken up a lot of time yes it
 
05:24:14.670 --> 05:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
has because sometimes land has been been
 
05:24:17.910 --> 05:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
presented to us we don't even know if
 
05:24:20.430 --> 05:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
there's a clear title to it we don't
 
05:24:22.628 --> 05:24:22.638 align:start position:0%
know if there's hazardous materials on
 
05:24:25.150 --> 05:24:25.160 align:start position:0%
it there are people that are willing to
 
05:24:27.510 --> 05:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
donate their land so they get out of a
 
05:24:32.150 --> 05:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
hazardous material situation yes the the
 
05:24:35.750 --> 05:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
commission takes their time on some
 
05:24:38.868 --> 05:24:38.878 align:start position:0%
pieces of land to make sure
 
05:24:42.590 --> 05:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
that the state is not getting a
 
05:24:45.510 --> 05:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
hazardous material site or something
 
05:24:49.270 --> 05:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to bite us down the
 
05:24:53.470 --> 05:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
road we cannot keep everybody happy
 
05:24:55.910 --> 05:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
people will come in and say the
 
05:24:59.948 --> 05:24:59.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:03.230 --> 05:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
us I talk to
 
05:25:05.510 --> 05:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
everybody the people that complain about
 
05:25:07.230 --> 05:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
the commission are the ones that don't
 
05:25:08.948 --> 05:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
get their way
 
05:25:11.430 --> 05:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
the ones that come in and say I want
 
05:25:11.440 --> 05:25:14.230 align:start position:0%
the ones that come in and say I want
trapping

05:25:14.230 --> 05:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:17.310 --> 05:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
outlawed we don't Outlaw it no the
 
05:25:19.590 --> 05:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
commission doesn't listen they don't
 
05:25:21.430 --> 05:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
listen to
 
05:25:25.390 --> 05:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
us and I'm going to give you a perfect
 
05:25:27.628 --> 05:25:27.638 align:start position:0%
example of how the
 
05:25:30.670 --> 05:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
commission with fishing game works
 
05:25:32.750 --> 05:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
because you had dealt with this last
 
05:25:36.670 --> 05:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
week was a poaching bill and I hate to
 
05:25:39.510 --> 05:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
throw a pass director under the bus but
 
05:25:42.070 --> 05:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
I want you to understand how this
 
05:25:46.270 --> 05:25:46.280 align:start position:0%
commission Works two years ago we
 
05:25:48.910 --> 05:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
brought up about poaching that something
 
05:25:52.750 --> 05:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
had to be done all we did was give the
 
05:25:56.390 --> 05:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
idea fishing game do something about
 
05:25:58.868 --> 05:25:58.878 align:start position:0%
this a year went
 
05:26:02.190 --> 05:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
by nothing was
 
05:26:04.708 --> 05:26:04.718 align:start position:0%
done and if you look on that bill it'll
 
05:26:07.230 --> 05:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
say that bill was started by the
 
05:26:10.270 --> 05:26:10.280 align:start position:0%
commission because a commission had said
 
05:26:12.070 --> 05:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
fishing game you didn't do anything
 
05:26:16.310 --> 05:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
about it we are and we started the
 
05:26:20.030 --> 05:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
bill and that's the bill you received
 
05:26:20.040 --> 05:26:21.628 align:start position:0%
bill and that's the bill you received
last

05:26:21.628 --> 05:26:21.638 align:start position:0%
last
 
05:26:23.948 --> 05:26:23.958 align:start position:0%
week and if you want to make this
 
05:26:25.830 --> 05:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
commission like I
 
05:26:28.670 --> 05:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
say advisory
 
05:26:31.430 --> 05:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
only I know you wouldn't be a rep if you
 
05:26:36.670 --> 05:26:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:38.590 --> 05:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I'm open to there any
 
05:26:40.990 --> 05:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
questions I'm very hot about this
 
05:26:43.590 --> 05:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
subject Mr chair I know I can't ask ask
 
05:26:46.868 --> 05:26:46.878 align:start position:0%
a question and that's okay but he um
 
05:26:49.948 --> 05:26:49.958 align:start position:0%
mistakenly um attributed the bill to
 
05:26:52.110 --> 05:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
representative Reed I want to make sure
 
05:26:53.830 --> 05:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
that everybody's clear that um it's
 
05:26:56.910 --> 05:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
represent clarified thank you
 
05:27:00.270 --> 05:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
05:27:02.990 --> 05:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
ulette we heard uh testimonial a while
 
05:27:05.070 --> 05:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
ago saying it's very difficult to run a
 
05:27:08.310 --> 05:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
company by a board by a commission and I
 
05:27:12.230 --> 05:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
kind of picture it as that the director
 
05:27:14.190 --> 05:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
runs the day-to-day but the commissioner
 
05:27:15.548 --> 05:27:15.558 align:start position:0%
is like the board of directors Who
 
05:27:18.110 --> 05:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
overseas sets policy and runs it is that
 
05:27:21.830 --> 05:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
a correct that is 100% correct thank the
 
05:27:25.230 --> 05:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
director does the daytoday operation The
 
05:27:29.708 --> 05:27:29.718 align:start position:0%

can actually add beyond our two
 
05:28:13.470 --> 05:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners what they said so I'm just
 
05:28:15.270 --> 05:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
going to read a quick snippet um from
 
05:28:16.868 --> 05:28:16.878 align:start position:0%
our prepared testimony just to share
 
05:28:18.590 --> 05:28:18.600 align:start position:0%

05:28:20.750 --> 05:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh we feel that eliminating this
 
05:28:22.830 --> 05:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
system of this system of Citizen
 
05:28:24.350 --> 05:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioners working in tandem with our
 
05:28:26.190 --> 05:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
executive director to better serve the
 
05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
needs of our respective constituents and
 
05:28:29.030 --> 05:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
ensure the sustainability and
 
05:28:30.868 --> 05:28:30.878 align:start position:0%
accessibility of our natural resources
 
05:28:32.948 --> 05:28:32.958 align:start position:0%
would be very ill advised our
 
05:28:34.230 --> 05:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
commissioners advocate for their
 
05:28:35.750 --> 05:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
specific counties needs to New Hampshire
 
05:28:37.910 --> 05:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
fishing game with commissions current
 
05:28:39.590 --> 05:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
the commission's current Authority they
 
05:28:41.030 --> 05:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
can ensure those needs are being met
 
05:28:43.150 --> 05:28:43.160 align:start position:0%
real time the commiss Commissioners
 
05:28:44.628 --> 05:28:44.638 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully and ethically represent the
 
05:28:46.708 --> 05:28:46.718 align:start position:0%
diverse interests of their constituents
 
05:28:48.230 --> 05:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
the needs and concerns of these areas
 
05:28:49.628 --> 05:28:49.638 align:start position:0%
can differ greatly from one end of the
 
05:28:51.830 --> 05:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
state to the other New Hampshire fishing
 
05:28:53.310 --> 05:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
Game Commission brings years of
 
05:28:55.230 --> 05:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
collective institutional knowledge in
 
05:28:56.868 --> 05:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
addition to providing a real-time input
 
05:28:58.110 --> 05:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
as to where New Hampshire's outdoor
 
05:29:00.070 --> 05:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
Community stands in critical issues
 
05:29:01.510 --> 05:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
within their specific County and the
 
05:29:03.628 --> 05:29:03.638 align:start position:0%
state in general we believe the New
 
05:29:05.070 --> 05:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game commission's
 
05:29:07.670 --> 05:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
consent is needed now more than ever for
 
05:29:09.470 --> 05:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
decision related to long-term planning
 
05:29:10.708 --> 05:29:10.718 align:start position:0%

power must never be trusted without a
 
05:29:24.628 --> 05:29:24.638 align:start position:0%
check and I wholeheartedly agree as a
 
05:29:26.708 --> 05:29:26.718 align:start position:0%
small business owner you have to have an
 
05:29:27.948 --> 05:29:27.958 align:start position:0%

05:29:30.190 --> 05:29:30.200 align:start position:0%

Spain thank you as you all know we heard

housekeeping as one General housekeeping
 
05:32:21.510 --> 05:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
bill was ruled non- gerain so it has to
 
05:32:24.150 --> 05:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
have its own public hearing this bill is
 
05:32:26.350 --> 05:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
being introduced because we ran into a
 
05:32:29.430 --> 05:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
situation uh where we have a constituent
 
05:32:32.190 --> 05:32:32.200 align:start position:0%
who many years ago many many years ago
 
05:32:35.708 --> 05:32:35.718 align:start position:0%
injured his shoulder and uh got a
 
05:32:38.670 --> 05:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
crossbow license for his his hunting
 
05:32:40.070 --> 05:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh permanently
 
05:32:43.750 --> 05:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
disabled and medical science has
 
05:32:45.270 --> 05:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
progressed to the point where he was
 
05:32:47.628 --> 05:32:47.638 align:start position:0%
able to received treatment fixed his
 
05:32:49.510 --> 05:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
shoulder completely and he was cleared
 
05:32:51.150 --> 05:32:51.160 align:start position:0%
to go back to hunting with his regular
 
05:32:53.150 --> 05:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
bow but when he approached the
 
05:32:55.628 --> 05:32:55.638 align:start position:0%
department the administrative staff at
 
05:32:58.868 --> 05:32:58.878 align:start position:0%
the department um said that he could not
 
05:33:01.150 --> 05:33:01.160 align:start position:0%
have a regular bow hunting license that
 
05:33:03.030 --> 05:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
he was stuck using a crossbow license
 
05:33:05.030 --> 05:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
forever and ever because in the law it
 
05:33:06.510 --> 05:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
said in
 
05:33:08.948 --> 05:33:08.958 align:start position:0%
perpetuity and talked to Colonel Jordan
 
05:33:10.470 --> 05:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
about this and I said that's not how
 
05:33:12.788 --> 05:33:12.798 align:start position:0%
this is supposed to work the permanent
 
05:33:14.270 --> 05:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
part was just supposed to mean he didn't
 
05:33:15.670 --> 05:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
have to come back every year and prove
 
05:33:18.430 --> 05:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
he was still disabled but if we always
 
05:33:20.230 --> 05:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
hope people get better we always hope
 
05:33:21.670 --> 05:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
that they can go back to using their
 
05:33:24.470 --> 05:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
regular bow if they if they get better
 
05:33:27.750 --> 05:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
um and we both agreed on that but the
 
05:33:29.390 --> 05:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
staff said there's nothing we can do we
 
05:33:31.548 --> 05:33:31.558 align:start position:0%
can't issue him his regular hunting
 
05:33:33.110 --> 05:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
license for his bow
 
05:33:36.510 --> 05:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
anymore so we now want to put this
 
05:33:39.788 --> 05:33:39.798 align:start position:0%
amendment through that will strike out
 
05:33:41.750 --> 05:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
the part that says the crossbow permit
 
05:33:43.150 --> 05:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
shall be
 
05:33:46.230 --> 05:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
perpetual and that will allow the staff
 
05:33:48.830 --> 05:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
to allow somebody who gets better to go
 
05:33:50.430 --> 05:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
back to hunting with the regular bow and
 
05:33:52.150 --> 05:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
not be stuck with their crossbow license
 
05:33:55.150 --> 05:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
at all times and I'll take any
 
05:33:58.470 --> 05:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:01.990 --> 05:34:02.000 align:start position:0%

05:34:04.708 --> 05:34:04.718 align:start position:0%

05:34:06.830 --> 05:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
you heard you I think you're right thank
 
05:34:10.750 --> 05:34:10.760 align:start position:0%

up the ra back to fish gain Department
 
05:34:17.510 --> 05:34:17.520 align:start position:0%

need any other questions for uh chairman
 
05:34:29.230 --> 05:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:31.910 --> 05:34:31.920 align:start position:0%

05:34:34.470 --> 05:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
for today when the chairman returns
 
05:34:44.590 --> 05:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:46.030 --> 05:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
hearing on the non- Germain amendment is
 
05:34:48.830 --> 05:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
closed we have uh multiple bills that we
 
05:34:52.350 --> 05:34:52.360 align:start position:0%
could do some quick execs on we have uh
 
05:34:54.470 --> 05:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
about 25 minutes and we've got to be out
 
05:34:57.788 --> 05:34:57.798 align:start position:0%
of here um I would like to do some execs
 
05:34:59.788 --> 05:34:59.798 align:start position:0%
and get them out of the way if that's
 
05:35:01.628 --> 05:35:01.638 align:start position:0%

05:35:05.430 --> 05:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
Harvey
 
05:35:08.230 --> 05:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
um yes maybe yes maybe no
 
05:35:11.150 --> 05:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
um I just don't want us to get into um
 
05:35:12.670 --> 05:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
you know a heavy discussion about
 
05:35:14.190 --> 05:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
something and it gets to be five o'clock
 
05:35:16.670 --> 05:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
and we have to leave I I'd rather you
 
05:35:18.590 --> 05:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
know us to be able to finish our
 
05:35:22.270 --> 05:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
discussion completely and and not carry
 
05:35:24.830 --> 05:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
that forward and have to exec you know
 
05:35:30.030 --> 05:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
later on so just be mindful maybe of um
 
05:35:32.670 --> 05:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
if it's a bill that is going to seems to
 
05:35:35.990 --> 05:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
be requiring some um argument or
 
05:35:37.948 --> 05:35:37.958 align:start position:0%
discussion or whatever that it might not
 
05:35:39.510 --> 05:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
be the best to take up right now
 
05:35:42.510 --> 05:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
understood why don't we take up uh
 
05:35:44.628 --> 05:35:44.638 align:start position:0%
initially the fact that I'm going to
 
05:35:48.430 --> 05:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
offer this amendment onto 655 and if we
 
05:35:51.270 --> 05:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
open up the exec session on 655 we could
 
05:35:53.150 --> 05:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
open we could open with this non-gain
 
05:35:55.990 --> 05:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
amendment and put that right on to that
 
05:35:56.000 --> 05:35:56.868 align:start position:0%
amendment and put that right on to that
uh

05:35:56.868 --> 05:35:56.878 align:start position:0%

05:36:00.270 --> 05:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
it's sorry would that be okay with you
 
05:36:03.030 --> 05:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
that would be fine I also had had that
 
05:36:04.548 --> 05:36:04.558 align:start position:0%
simple amendment that changed the dollar
 
05:36:06.110 --> 05:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
amount too we can talk about that at the
 
05:36:07.670 --> 05:36:07.680 align:start position:0%

05:36:11.750 --> 05:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:17.030 --> 05:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:19.590 --> 05:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
655 move to pass on
 
05:36:22.788 --> 05:36:22.798 align:start position:0%

that makes it otpa at the moment the
 
05:38:13.750 --> 05:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
bill is open to further amendments if
 
05:38:15.230 --> 05:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to offer a further
 
05:38:17.750 --> 05:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment um I would like to offer an
 
05:38:19.670 --> 05:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
05:38:23.948 --> 05:38:23.958 align:start position:0%
0299 which simply changes the um um
 
05:38:26.470 --> 05:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
violation fee for Fisher Bobcat otter
 
05:38:31.070 --> 05:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
and fox from $200 to $1,000 and I have
 
05:38:33.948 --> 05:38:33.958 align:start position:0%
um it was 500 in the original bill but
 
05:38:36.070 --> 05:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
this raises it to a th000 and I have
 
05:38:38.150 --> 05:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
copies of this amendment pass them
 
05:38:39.788 --> 05:38:39.798 align:start position:0%
around and do you have a second if
 
05:38:42.750 --> 05:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:45.190 --> 05:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
that okay it's been moved and seconded
 
05:38:48.230 --> 05:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
by rep Fox it's open for
 
05:38:51.708 --> 05:38:51.718 align:start position:0%
discussion I I can address that soon as
 
05:38:54.190 --> 05:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
you hand those over you feel free to
 
05:38:57.788 --> 05:38:57.798 align:start position:0%
discuss that so so my my reason for the
 
05:38:59.590 --> 05:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
for just changing that one line in the
 
05:39:03.750 --> 05:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
bill um is is very simple um um of all
 
05:39:06.468 --> 05:39:06.478 align:start position:0%
the animals and and wild of all the
 
05:39:08.628 --> 05:39:08.638 align:start position:0%
wildlife that was listed in there uh
 
05:39:11.270 --> 05:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
Fisher is one of
 
05:39:14.750 --> 05:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
um is is being decimated we heard last
 
05:39:17.230 --> 05:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
week that UNH has actually started a
 
05:39:20.510 --> 05:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
study to see why we're losing our Fisher
 
05:39:23.670 --> 05:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
um population it could be um because of
 
05:39:26.270 --> 05:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
rodenticides we don't know but they've
 
05:39:29.110 --> 05:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
started um UNH has a a study going to
 
05:39:31.430 --> 05:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
see what has happened to our Fisher Fox
 
05:39:33.548 --> 05:39:33.558 align:start position:0%
is the same way you saw a graph this
 
05:39:36.430 --> 05:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
morning the number of fox are are going
 
05:39:40.628 --> 05:39:40.638 align:start position:0%
down so so if something happens to those
 
05:39:43.948 --> 05:39:43.958 align:start position:0%
particular animals um it is much more
 
05:39:47.670 --> 05:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
harmful and detrimental to our Wildlife
 
05:39:50.030 --> 05:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
than if something is happens to a
 
05:39:54.310 --> 05:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
squirrel or a turkey and so I I just I
 
05:39:57.948 --> 05:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
think that because those are so not
 
05:39:59.628 --> 05:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
they're not on an endangered list but
 
05:40:02.548 --> 05:40:02.558 align:start position:0%
because they're so critical the fine for
 
05:40:04.430 --> 05:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
that should be more than it was
 
05:40:07.030 --> 05:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
originally so I um I'm offering this
 
05:40:09.350 --> 05:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
amend mment to raise that fine to
 
05:40:12.110 --> 05:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
$1,000 for any any further discussion
 
05:40:12.120 --> 05:40:13.190 align:start position:0%
$1,000 for any any further discussion
representative

05:40:13.190 --> 05:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:40:16.708 --> 05:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
tutor thank you Mr chair I uh I oppose
 
05:40:19.310 --> 05:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment um this bill is about
 
05:40:21.628 --> 05:40:21.638 align:start position:0%
restitution and it should be about the
 
05:40:23.750 --> 05:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
cost of basically replacing the animal
 
05:40:26.390 --> 05:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
if you if you wanted to or had to and to
 
05:40:28.910 --> 05:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
put a uh Fisher at the same level as a
 
05:40:32.670 --> 05:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
deer moose uh just doesn't seem right to
 
05:40:35.708 --> 05:40:35.718 align:start position:0%
me any further discussion representative
 
05:40:35.718 --> 05:40:37.628 align:start position:0%
me any further discussion representative
Stone

05:40:37.628 --> 05:40:37.638 align:start position:0%
Stone
 
05:40:39.990 --> 05:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
I think she's right I I I addressed this
 
05:40:43.070 --> 05:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
a week ago about $1,000 2,000 you got to
 
05:40:45.270 --> 05:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
do something to make them think twice if
 
05:40:46.750 --> 05:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
you don't do it they're going to keep on
 
05:40:49.030 --> 05:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
doing it I agree with a
 
05:40:53.230 --> 05:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
$1,000 I would go more if we
 
05:40:56.070 --> 05:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
could any further discussion rep oh
 
05:40:58.590 --> 05:40:58.600 align:start position:0%
representative ulette uh thank you Mr
 
05:41:01.628 --> 05:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
chair uh I again I I will disagree with
 
05:41:03.708 --> 05:41:03.718 align:start position:0%
with u representative Harvey just for
 
05:41:05.788 --> 05:41:05.798 align:start position:0%
the simple reason that our friends at
 
05:41:07.670 --> 05:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
fishing gam set these limits on what the
 
05:41:09.590 --> 05:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
value was and they were very very clear
 
05:41:11.390 --> 05:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
last week that when they're talking
 
05:41:12.830 --> 05:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
about law enforcement it's never
 
05:41:15.548 --> 05:41:15.558 align:start position:0%
punitive it's all educational and this
 
05:41:16.868 --> 05:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be replacement cost of
 
05:41:16.878 --> 05:41:19.788 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be replacement cost of
the

05:41:19.788 --> 05:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:22.910 --> 05:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
animal representative Harvey so I'm
 
05:41:26.468 --> 05:41:26.478 align:start position:0%
confused how we um uh replace an animal
 
05:41:31.548 --> 05:41:31.558 align:start position:0%
once it's once it's dead it's dead um so
 
05:41:34.390 --> 05:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
and because these two animals Fisher and
 
05:41:37.430 --> 05:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
fox are so their populations are so down
 
05:41:40.150 --> 05:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
it it would be even harder then to
 
05:41:43.390 --> 05:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
replace those animal so I'll add on to
 
05:41:46.030 --> 05:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
that replacement cost of the animal is
 
05:41:48.390 --> 05:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
done the same way essentially we
 
05:41:50.510 --> 05:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
repopulated our turkeys in that instance
 
05:41:52.990 --> 05:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't pay money but we traded uh
 
05:41:55.868 --> 05:41:55.878 align:start position:0%
what was it Fishers Fishers for turkeys
 
05:41:57.990 --> 05:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
and we repopulated our turkeys from zero
 
05:42:00.110 --> 05:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
in the state by bringing in turkeys from
 
05:42:01.590 --> 05:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
another state and trading them some of
 
05:42:01.600 --> 05:42:02.230 align:start position:0%
another state and trading them some of
our

05:42:02.230 --> 05:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:42:04.750 --> 05:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
Fishers um but in some instances the
 
05:42:06.230 --> 05:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
state will actually have to purchase
 
05:42:08.750 --> 05:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
those animals to repopulate a population
 
05:42:11.548 --> 05:42:11.558 align:start position:0%
and that's what the the uh cost is
 
05:42:14.150 --> 05:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
supposed to uh capture is is the
 
05:42:16.030 --> 05:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
restitution to the state for the value
 
05:42:18.390 --> 05:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
of the animal that was killed in case
 
05:42:20.230 --> 05:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
the state needed to replace that animal
 
05:42:23.670 --> 05:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
am I correct Colonel Jordan thank you uh
 
05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:28.160 --> 05:42:30.030 align:start position:0%
 
comments

05:42:30.030 --> 05:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
comments
 
05:42:33.190 --> 05:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
see um yes representative Jacobs thank
 
05:42:35.430 --> 05:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
you I think we've heard a few times
 
05:42:37.270 --> 05:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
today that the Fisher population is in
 
05:42:40.708 --> 05:42:40.718 align:start position:0%
danger so I feel like it makes sense to
 
05:42:42.990 --> 05:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
raise the fine especially if we're
 
05:42:45.990 --> 05:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
looking at a dwindling population I
 
05:42:49.190 --> 05:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
mean yeah I feel it's reasonable thank
 
05:42:52.990 --> 05:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
you I'll add on that it's not a fine
 
05:42:54.110 --> 05:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
05:42:56.350 --> 05:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
restitution um it's supposed to capture
 
05:42:58.468 --> 05:42:58.478 align:start position:0%
the value of a Fisher Colonel Jordan do
 
05:43:00.350 --> 05:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
we have any actual figures on what it
 
05:43:02.150 --> 05:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
would cost us to buy a Fisher or a
 
05:43:04.510 --> 05:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
population of fishers from another state
 
05:43:06.788 --> 05:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
not that I'm aware of I mean if I had
 
05:43:08.350 --> 05:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
had time I could have asked Brad to find
 
05:43:09.468 --> 05:43:09.478 align:start position:0%
that for us and I'm sure that he could
 
05:43:12.830 --> 05:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
have found that within about uh a day
 
05:43:15.110 --> 05:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
but uh the only issue I can see at
 
05:43:18.350 --> 05:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
creating if we go as high as a large
 
05:43:21.708 --> 05:43:21.718 align:start position:0%
SP it will cause some confusion with our
 
05:43:23.868 --> 05:43:23.878 align:start position:0%
judges so we'd have to explain to the
 
05:43:27.390 --> 05:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
judges why we're getting ,000 for a
 
05:43:30.670 --> 05:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
Fisher and five I think it's $500 for a
 
05:43:33.190 --> 05:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
light that would that would create some
 
05:43:35.430 --> 05:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
discussion in the courtroom which you
 
05:43:37.750 --> 05:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
know makes me nervous open the door for
 
05:43:41.350 --> 05:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
a judge thank you I understand I
 
05:43:44.190 --> 05:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
understand representa it's a blurry line
 
05:43:49.990 --> 05:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
between fine and restitution right um
 
05:43:53.948 --> 05:43:53.958 align:start position:0%
so any any other comments
 
05:43:56.270 --> 05:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
questions seeing
 
05:43:56.280 --> 05:43:58.830 align:start position:0%
questions seeing
none

05:43:58.830 --> 05:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
none
 
05:44:02.310 --> 05:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
um do we have a I do I do okay
 
05:44:02.320 --> 05:44:05.590 align:start position:0%
um do we have a I do I do okay
representative

05:44:05.590 --> 05:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:08.150 --> 05:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
DeVito I was to with if I was going to
 
05:44:09.788 --> 05:44:09.798 align:start position:0%
say something
 
05:44:12.910 --> 05:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
um I feel like this really is bluring
 
05:44:16.590 --> 05:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
the line between emotion and facts um of
 
05:44:18.948 --> 05:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
what the animal's life is worth who is
 
05:44:23.110 --> 05:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
to say that a squirrel or a red fox or
 
05:44:26.750 --> 05:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
something else their life is worth more
 
05:44:30.590 --> 05:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
than a deer or vice versa so if we're
 
05:44:30.600 --> 05:44:32.190 align:start position:0%
than a deer or vice versa so if we're
talking

05:44:32.190 --> 05:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
talking
 
05:44:35.350 --> 05:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
about a monetary value of an animal's
 
05:44:37.590 --> 05:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
life then why isn't it
 
05:44:39.670 --> 05:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
the same number across the
 
05:44:41.948 --> 05:44:41.958 align:start position:0%
board why are we putting more on a
 
05:44:43.990 --> 05:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
Fisher and I understand we're saying
 
05:44:47.590 --> 05:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
they're in danger um but that could
 
05:44:52.510 --> 05:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
happen with any animal and so I I in my
 
05:44:55.590 --> 05:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
mind I can't wrap my mind around saying
 
05:44:59.150 --> 05:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
$1,000 for a Fisher
 
05:45:02.868 --> 05:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
yet a fox is is less than that or any
 
05:45:02.878 --> 05:45:05.030 align:start position:0%
yet a fox is is less than that or any
other

05:45:05.030 --> 05:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:45:07.430 --> 05:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
animal representative Harvey
 
05:45:10.030 --> 05:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
so if you're making a motion that we
 
05:45:11.948 --> 05:45:11.958 align:start position:0%
amend the bill so that all the animals
 
05:45:11.958 --> 05:45:12.948 align:start position:0%

you know as as much as I would love to
 
05:48:54.670 --> 05:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
fund search and rescue to the hilt um we
 
05:48:59.468 --> 05:48:59.478 align:start position:0%
heard testimony today that um uh it this
 
05:49:02.468 --> 05:49:02.478 align:start position:0%
price tag is 200,000 and it would be
 
05:49:06.708 --> 05:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
200,000 every year um which may build
 
05:49:09.708 --> 05:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
build up to quite a large sum of money
 
05:49:12.868 --> 05:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
um if it's if it's not used um and then
 
05:49:15.150 --> 05:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony from Colonel Jordan
 
05:49:17.230 --> 05:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
that says right now they're in pretty
 
05:49:20.390 --> 05:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
good shape so it it would be very
 
05:49:21.628 --> 05:49:21.638 align:start position:0%
difficult for me to look at a
 
05:49:25.030 --> 05:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
constituent and say yes we gave them
 
05:49:26.830 --> 05:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
$200,000 even though they said they
 
05:49:31.030 --> 05:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
didn't need it um it it just is would be
 
05:49:34.310 --> 05:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
tough in a tight budget year so um I
 
05:49:37.230 --> 05:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
would vote to itl this bill thank you is
 
05:49:38.548 --> 05:49:38.558 align:start position:0%

05:49:43.110 --> 05:49:43.120 align:start position:0%

yeses all right uh any objection to
 
05:50:32.030 --> 05:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
consent seeing none uh do you need a
 
05:50:34.150 --> 05:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
blur then for that I do need it because
 
05:50:35.708 --> 05:50:35.718 align:start position:0%
if it gets pulled from consent we need
 
05:50:38.270 --> 05:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
to have it okay uh it's very simple yeah
 
05:50:42.190 --> 05:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
I know um done it before and with that I
 
05:50:45.430 --> 05:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
will leave the last three bills for exec
 
05:50:48.510 --> 05:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
on another time and in fact if I get up
 
05:50:51.070 --> 05:50:51.080 align:start position:0%
on the floor tomorrow during
 
05:50:54.350 --> 05:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
session I we can exec during lunch or
 
05:50:55.670 --> 05:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
something else and get some more of
 
05:50:57.070 --> 05:50:57.080 align:start position:0%
these done tomorrow rather than have
 
05:50:58.910 --> 05:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
everybody come in here for one day for
 
05:51:02.468 --> 05:51:02.478 align:start position:0%
three bills so uh that is an option that
 
05:51:04.868 --> 05:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
I can use tomorrow as long as we do it
 
05:51:06.628 --> 05:51:06.638 align:start position:0%
from the house floor I can announce that
 
05:51:09.510 --> 05:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
exec session tomorrow can I eat my lunch
 
05:51:12.150 --> 05:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
while we exec we would exec somewhere

other than this room so that we could do
 
05:51:16.910 --> 05:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
so I have two things for 589 that I need
 
05:51:20.230 --> 05:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
