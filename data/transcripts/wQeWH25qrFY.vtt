e

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
it being little past was it 10:01
 
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
now we open the finance thank you
 
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
division to work session and I'll call
 
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
on Mr landrian to start us off
 
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
everybody so I think today we could
 
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
probably fill two hours with kind of
 
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
just resetting recalibrating and setting
 
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
a plan for the next you know seven work
 
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
days essentially until this committee
 
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
should have all of its decisions done um
 
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
I provided some documents on everybody's
 
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
table just very briefly what they all
 
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
are one is the um it starts off with the
 
00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
house finance division 2 recommended
 
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
changes to House Bill one and two this
 
00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
is like our tracking sheets and I'll
 
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
walk us through this um it'll look
 
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
familiar to those who have been in the
 
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
committee before uh the next document is
 
00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
the house finance division 2 agency
 
00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 align:start position:0%
House Bill two draft uh requests um I'll
 
00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
walk us through that as well then I also
 
00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
gave you um which I think I had promised
 
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
before but hadn't given you till now the
 
00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
an index to House Bill two as well as
 
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
the official sections the back of the
 
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
budget sections for House Bill one um
 
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
not really a whole lot of heavy lift
 
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
there but we'll get to that when we go
 
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
through the tracking sheet and then just
 
00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 align:start position:0%
so you have it I think I emailed it to
 
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
everyone the two amendments that this
 
00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
committee adopted on bills so on Monday
 
00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
we have an exec session across the hall
 
00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 align:start position:0%
um those are the only two amendments
 
00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
that this committee um voted for when
 
00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 align:start position:0%
did you mail those uh I think back at
 
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
the time that I had them drafted okay
 
00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah those are the two yeah yeah so
 
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um just as we're getting into
 
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
this and we we're starting to look at
 
00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 align:start position:0%
lines in the budget um I wonder if we
 
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
could get an idea of what the division 2
 
00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
allocation is for money and what are
 
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 align:start position:0%
what they're going to say we have to cut
 
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
do we know other divisions seem to know
 
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
what theirs is do we know ours well yeah
 
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.590 align:start position:0%
what theirs is do we know ours well yeah
sort

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
sort
 
00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
of so this is still the subject of
 
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
discussion um when that allocation
 
00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
you've heard of
 
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
about well that you've heard other You'
 
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
apparently heard something other
 
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
divisions have um that was
 
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
done uh at a time and by someone who
 
00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 align:start position:0%
thought differently didn't understand
 
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
that adequacy the the funding of local
 
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
schools was pretty much not going to be
 
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
caught or we probably wouldn't be in
 
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.390 align:start position:0%
caught or we probably wouldn't be in
charge

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
charge
 
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 align:start position:0%
anymore which would disappoint a lot of
 
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
people on our side wouldn't wouldn't bum
 
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
you out too much
 
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
up fair enough in any case I will give
 
00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
you the number um but that was was under
 
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
that you know assumption so there's I
 
00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
I'm still working to okay redirect
 
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
people but they're talking about cutting
 
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 align:start position:0%
about $200 million out of division 2 now
 
00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
having said that um one of the things
 
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
that is in the governor's budget you I'm
 
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 align:start position:0%
sure you're all aware of is the lottery
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
um piece where which we have not yet um
 
00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 align:start position:0%
addressed and there is a plan to uh try
 
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
to address that um so we're I'm meeting
 
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
with ways of means and with other folks
 
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
um to so theoretically half of that
 
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
roughly hopefully would be that 200
 
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
million I'm talking about so without the
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
lottery we'd be host in terms of that
 
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
cut trying to reduce $200 million um
 
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
with that hopefully we'll be in a better
 
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
position although still not in a great
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
position does that answer your question
 
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
as I can yeah yeah it helps I'll take
 
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
any information um but if what if
 
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
Lottery doesn't pass the house doesn't
 
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
isn't there still a bill to go to the
 
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
house and if Lottery does not pass the
 
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
house um are you going to be suggesting
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
that we just put it into the budget
 
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the House vote
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
is well it it won't be regardless of
 
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
what the House vote is because it
 
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like they're going to be a
 
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
house vote so but the answer to your
 
00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
question is yes we're just going to put
 
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
it in the budget I'll let Mr landing and
 
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
speak to the to the the doing that but
 
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding that we are able
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
to do that and and that's the approach
 
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
that I'm
 
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
envisioning so relative to video Lottery
 
00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:43.479 align:start position:0%
terminals um the governor did put put
 
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
forth a proposal and that's in House
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
Bill too so making changes to that in
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
this committee is Germaine inappropriate
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
we did talk about uh deferring to the
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
work that house Ways and Means would do
 
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
728 um there's no requirement this
 
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
committee adopt that we had discussed
 
00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
that maybe was an approach um so for
 
00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
instance if house ways a means were to
 
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
retain that bill for instance really all
 
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
of that work would would fall here if
 
00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:08.879 align:start position:0%
you did want to pass some legislation
 
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
that included VTS and account for the
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
revenue so I believe they have an exec
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
session scheduled on that bill Tuesday
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
and I know there are others also working
 
00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
on some different uh proposals relative
 
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
to this so probably next week we'd have
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
to get an amendment drafted and review
 
00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
it and discuss it and then perhaps have
 
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
Lottery come in to see if they would um
 
00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
help us with a revenue estimate or or
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
Associated hold on um does that no
 
00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:46.270 align:start position:0%
Associated hold on um does that no
okay

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:48.879 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you Mr chair um good
 
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
morning I just wanted to make sure I
 
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
understand so when when we change fees
 
00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
and whatnot those Revenue estimates do
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
they still have to go through way and me
 
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:02.360 align:start position:0%
or do we just B them into our part of
 
00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
the budget I just cannot remember from
 
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
last term what was the process for that
 
00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:08.759 align:start position:0%
so anything that goes through this
 
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
committee you can ask Ways and Means for
 
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
their input But ultimately the estimates
 
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
are part of your plan and when we get
 
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
into formulating the Surplus statement
 
00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:19.879 align:start position:0%
we would rely on the committee to decide
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
how much revenue you're estimating
 
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
associated with that change thank you I
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
was just worried about the time the
 
00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:25.639 align:start position:0%
short time frame and I just wanted to
 
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand how many Hoops we
 
00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
got to go through this help we should be
 
00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:31.639 align:start position:0%
able handle that Allin committee with
 
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
maybe some offline discussion if you
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
wish with either the chair of house Ways
 
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
and Means or members from ways of means
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
to get their input But ultimately that
 
00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:40.519 align:start position:0%
decision would lie in this committee as
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
far as how much to estimate on a revenue
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
provision but okay so guess we'll
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
continue so I don't I want like to keep
 
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
us somewhat focused today but I think
 
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
one important thing that we get to we
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
don't have to get to it right away is
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
putting a plan together for the next
 
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
week uh week plus specifically uh as you
 
00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959 align:start position:0%
all we we reserved almost every day next
 
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
week with some division two time but I
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
think having some uh focus on what you
 
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
want to do on each of those days will be
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
helpful so maybe when we go through all
 
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
this today at the end maybe we can
 
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
decide who we want to have in for how
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
long and on which days and to talk about
 
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
what um I suppose I could just Dive
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
Right into these documents and also as I
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
go through these are meant to be
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
somewhat complete I've tried to compile
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
everything that is kind of in our
 
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
division 2 Universe to consider if
 
00:09:39.389 --> 00:09:39.399 align:start position:0%
there's anything on here that you think
 
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
is wrong or you think something's
 
00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
missing just we'll talk through it when
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
I update these sheets which I plan to do
 
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
every day you meet um I'll I'll add
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
those in for Monday is fishing game
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
coming today not today no so nobody's
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
coming in today but I was suggesting uh
 
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
so I sent you all uh pretty hefty amount
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
of follow-up information they provided
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh I suggest maybe Monday
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
morning we have only two hours in
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
division because of the full Committee
 
00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:06.279 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon maybe Monday morning we
 
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
have fishing game come in and walk us
 
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
through those documents we could
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
probably fill most of the two hours just
 
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
going through all that stuff and so we
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
have Revenue estimates from or not
 
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
reeven estimates um fee thing
 
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
information from safety are they come in
 
00:10:23.949 --> 00:10:23.959 align:start position:0%
to present those or what we can have saf
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
and this is again when we go through all
 
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
this today maybe on the back end we can
 
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
decide uh what you want to do we can
 
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
certainly invite everyone or anybody
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
back in not necessarily everyone you may
 
00:10:35.629 --> 00:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
we don't necessarily have to you don't
 
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
have to no but if you would like
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
additional information or to talk
 
00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
through anything with the agencies we
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
can invite them back and I'm sure they'd
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
be more than willing um specific with
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
safety they did provide some fee um
 
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
information some like a some a
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet to calculate some fee
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
increases going back and forth with them
 
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
on that just to check it for accuracy
 
00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
right now so I had a few questions in so
 
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:01.240 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure we have a clean
 
00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:03.399 align:start position:0%
tool to use if you did want to explore
 
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
adjusting any fees so I'm still going
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
back and forth with them on that so just
 
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
along those lines you understand what
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
I've been hoping to do we got back to
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
the whole money thing I'm hoping we can
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
use as I think I mentioned this before
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
but fees in fishing game would they
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
mention that they were good with some of
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
the ones in the dedicated funds to make
 
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
fishing game fund um
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
solvent and uh unnecessary to have
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
General draw General funds similarly
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
with safe to make the highway fund
 
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
solvent and um perhaps even so we we
 
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
currently as you're probably aware we
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
currently provide I think it's $2
 
00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:42.519 align:start position:0%
million a year to Judiciary related to
 
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
their court cases with regard to Motor
 
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
Vehicles so one possibility is because
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
division one of course has issues as
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
well um is to increase that that amount
 
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
which has not been increased for quite
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
some number of years if we're able to
 
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
make the highway fund um well enough off
 
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
so I'd say the first document we can
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
dive into is the the tracking sheet
 
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
document so the first one should be on
 
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
the top of your piles the house finance
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
recommended changes to House Bill one
 
00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:13.829 align:start position:0%
recommended changes to House Bill one
and

00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
two so again this is a should be a
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
familiar sheet for those who are here
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
before and what this first page does is
 
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
lays out all of the house bill one back
 
00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
of the budget sections and all of the
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
house bill two sections that are
 
00:12:30.269 --> 00:12:30.279 align:start position:0%
assigned to division 2 so on all of the
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
I will ask that the committee does vote
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
either you'll make a vote to adopt an
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
amendment to delete it an amendment to
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
change it or you just want to accept it
 
00:12:41.069 --> 00:12:41.079 align:start position:0%
as is how it came to you from the
 
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
governor so at some point we'll take a
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
vote on all of those um and then down
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
below as we start getting some drafted
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
uh any more any additional House Bill
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
two amendments I'll list at the bottom
 
00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
and then keep track of those um and then
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
if you look on the next four pages
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
there are four amendments that the
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
committee could consider today I I would
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
look at these as somewhat technical in
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
nature um and you can see on the first
 
00:13:10.269 --> 00:13:10.279 align:start position:0%
page here I've bold and highlighted
 
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
which section those amendments would uh
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
change so I don't know if if that's
 
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
something you wanted to do today I think
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's a nice easy start to get to do a
 
00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:22.839 align:start position:0%
couple votes and check a couple things
 
00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:26.519 align:start position:0%
off but I'll defer to to you all I would
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
certain love to do that as long as
 
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
there's agreement um
 
00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
on both sides I I think these are fairly
 
00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
noncontroversial is that I yeah I
 
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
believe so too um if you want me to walk
 
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
you through them I can real quick so the
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
first one so on page 46 of House Bill 2
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
Section 81 the ccsnh Dual and concurrent
 
00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839 align:start position:0%
enrollment so this was in the governor's
 
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
budget um it was also part of uh a bill
 
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
that was filed by the house house bill
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
192 which has been passed and is onto
 
00:13:59.470 --> 00:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
the Senate so this could be a se you
 
00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:01.959 align:start position:0%
just delete from House Bill 2 it has
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
independent legislation going through it
 
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
does not tie it House Bill one in any
 
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:07.720 align:start position:0%
way I think this a way you could clean
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
up House Bill too it's no longer
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
necessary in here and I did speak with I
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
want to use her last name to be
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate here miss Reed um Shan I
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
know it's Shannon but I was trying to be
 
00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
a little less a little more formal
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
Shannon Reed um about this and she is
 
00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:23.959 align:start position:0%
fine with what went went through the
 
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
Senate going on through it's just the
 
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.189 --> 00:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
so do you want to go and just deal with
 
00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
these as we go or how do you want to
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
handle it you certainly could so in the
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
past typically what you would do is you
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
know move it just like an an amendment
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
to any other Bill move and get a second
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
and take a vote on it and then I would
 
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
know that that amendment's been adopted
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
and then I'll put that in as part of our
 
00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
overall package of recommendations okay
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
motion sir representa Murray second to
 
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.230 align:start position:0%
motion sir representa Murray second to
delete

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:04.519 align:start position:0%
well finish complete I deleting it what
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
oh deleting section 81 yes correct yes
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
yes um so we're making a motion to
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
delete section 81 of hb2 on page 46
 
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
which is the ccsnh Dual and Curr
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment program credits
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
per course which actually defines a
 
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
limit some limitations on the number of
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
credits that attendees can get um
 
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
without their own expense being being uh
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
required this is because it's included
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
in another bill that's passed and this
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
is right so this language was in a bill
 
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
that we've already passed the house and
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
it's actually already on its way to the
 
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
Senate and the the um representative
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
from ccsnh was comfortable with that
 
00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.350 align:start position:0%
from ccsnh was comfortable with that
this

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
approach this is patience sure yeah take
 
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
take your
 
00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
time what is the bill number again is
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
there a bill number it's an HB
 
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
H so HB hb2 is the bill and it's section
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
81 m Mr chair yes ma' in the past two
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
and and if everyone agrees sorry to cut
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
everybody off a way to perhaps simplify
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
this because we will have a lot of votes
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
is just a show of hands oh instead of a
 
00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:19.959 align:start position:0%
roll call on on every single yeah you
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
may get to situations where you maybe
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
want to do a roll call on certain
 
00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
amendments later on but most of this you
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
I think if everyone agrees a show our
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
hands just to I think it may help the
 
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
our clerk as well as just overall
 
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
favor unanimous unless you're going to
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
vote against
 
00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:41.319 align:start position:0%
it do we need do we need to report a
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
second for that or Pap second did it he
 
00:16:45.959 --> 00:16:47.670 align:start position:0%
second for that or Pap second did it he
second

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
peace you miss a day or two nobody
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
and and what I'll do also again just
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
remind everyone on by Sunday night to
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
get ready for Monday you'll get a brand
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
new one of these with you know the
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
committee's actions populated in this
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
far right column so you'll be able to
 
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:17.720 align:start position:0%
see you know and again if anyone's like
 
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
hey we didn't agree on that or I'm you
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
know just bring it up to me and I make
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
mistakes and you know if if if
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
something's wrong in there we want to
 
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:25.480 align:start position:0%
make sure we get it
 
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
right what was
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so moving on similarly section
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
sections 143 and 144 of House Bill 2 are
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
relative to extra Duty functions of the
 
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
police standards and training uh
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
Specialists this also was included in
 
00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 but it also had a separate
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
bill that bill House Bill 778 has passed
 
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
the house and gone over to the Senate as
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
well so similarly I think you could
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
delete this it doesn't not need to be an
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
to and the last one was it was HB 193
 
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
on 62
 
00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
yes this isn't just related to overtime
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
isn't Al certain
 
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.470 align:start position:0%
isn't Al certain
people

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
certain I think this is relative to like
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
uh details like to per allow them to to
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
partake in police details right but it's
 
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
a certain it's not just is it so it's
 
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
any of the police standards people or
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
their training Specialists I think the
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
the language yeah I'm assuming certified
 
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
you know not not entire the entirety of
 
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
their staff okay for law enforcement
 
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
crowd control for public or private
 
00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
events extra Duty performed outside
 
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:44.230 align:start position:0%
 
them

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
okay he's good it would be nice if I
 
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
motion represent papic I will make such
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
motion have a
 
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
second representative hackin
 
00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
Phillips let me know when you're ready
 
00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:18.039 align:start position:0%
this is madam clerk we are accepting
 
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
sections we're we're we're deleting
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
we're deleting those sections because
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
they are in a separate bill that is
 
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
passed to the Senate
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
HB I'm sorry HB 778
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
778 yes so I'll just clarify so the
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
motion is to delete sections 143 and 144
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
of hb2 on page
 
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
62 as the same language or equivalent
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
language is in HB 778 which has already
 
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
Senate so just let us know when you're
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
ready and we'll take a okay so all in
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
the next one if we're ready to to move
 
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
on I would think would be it's page 64
 
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 2 Section 151 and there is
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
an amendment here
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
to uh correct it so the way that um this
 
00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
came to us in House Bill 2 uh if you
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
have House Bill 2 in front of you you'll
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
notice on lines 19 of page
 
00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
64 yeah this is where the intention was
 
00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:00.279 align:start position:0%
to delete that last sentence but the way
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
it was drafted it just added that same
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
language again so if you look on page
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
four of the tracking sheet package I
 
00:22:10.269 --> 00:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
sent you you'll see the amendment
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
strikes out that last sentence that was
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
the intention all along the Department's
 
00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
good with this this is what the go
 
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
Governor intended to put in um there's
 
00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:20.919 align:start position:0%
no fiscal impact here I I think this is
 
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
a pretty harmless
 
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
change it was yeah the way it came to us
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
so we would want to just adop accept
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
motion than you move to accept amendment
 
00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:52.110 align:start position:0%
motion than you move to accept amendment
number

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:52.120 align:start position:0%

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:56.190 align:start position:0%
number
0813

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
H represented poet Papa seconds
 
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
president Melly makes the motion and the
 
00:23:05.789 --> 00:23:05.799 align:start position:0%
motion is to accept the amendment that
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
is an correction to section 151 of
 
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
hb2 on page
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
64 basically deleting a sentence that
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
should have been deleted but was
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
mistakenly not
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
deleted and let me know when you're all
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
set okay um all in favor just raise your
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
opposed that's unanimous
 
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.470 align:start position:0%
opposed that's unanimous
thank

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:35.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.789 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
that all right Mr land and the the last
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
of the Amendments that we have drafted
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
for today would be on page 72 of house
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
bill to section
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
178 and we would delete this section and
 
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
the reason is and this is why I gave you
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
house bill one sections the back of the
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
budget sections this is the same
 
00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
language that is also oo in the back of
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
house bill one it's section two of House
 
00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
Bill one Sor sorry section four of house
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
bill one this language for the uh
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
Authority for the Lottery Commission to
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
acquire tickets and do this is
 
00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:12.919 align:start position:0%
boilerplate language that has been in
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
the back of house bill one for many many
 
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
years before my time um this allows them
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
to buy their ticket inventory their
 
00:24:22.269 --> 00:24:22.279 align:start position:0%
ticket stock um it's
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
boilerplate why it was included in House
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 I think was a mistake because it
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
is it was included in the governor's
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill one document so I think if
 
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
you delete it from House Bill two we can
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
just decide if you just want to give it
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
a thumbs up when we get to House Bill
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
one and I'll get us to that point but it
 
00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:39.559 align:start position:0%
definitely doesn't need to be in both it
 
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
should be in the back of house bill one
 
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.230 align:start position:0%
should be in the back of house bill one
for

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
motion representative papovich I'll move
 
00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
Murray so this is a motion to
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
adopt Amendment 2025 d89
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
toh which deletes section 178 from hb2
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
on page 72 as the language is this the
 
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:31.559 align:start position:0%
are you ready M Clark all in favor raise
 
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.510 align:start position:0%
your hands that's everybody anybody
opposed

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:36.520 align:start position:0%

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
no it's it's
 
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.050 align:start position:0%
no it's it's
no

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:40.060 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:47.389 align:start position:0%
no
[Laughter]

00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
to so yeah yeah no you're welcome uh so
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
those are the four amendments that we
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
had today I think pretty easy pretty uh
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
you know just mostly technical in nature
 
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
if the committee wants we can roll right
 
00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:09.559 align:start position:0%
to the top of this tracking sheet and if
 
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
there's any sections that you heard from
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
the Departments it's something that's
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
inous built to you don't think you are
 
00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
going to want to change you'll accept it
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
the way the governor and the agencies
 
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:21.799 align:start position:0%
Put It Forward you could just you could
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
vote today to accept those uh two right
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
off the bat I would say or the part of
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
the house bill one SE that I gave you
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
the education general fund and
 
00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:34.039 align:start position:0%
appropriation limits for um university
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
and Community College system and the
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission which we just talked
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
about those are boilerplate back of the
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
budget things that have existed uh
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
there's no impact with those you can
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
take a look or you know just think about
 
00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
it for next time we meet um that's where
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
are you right now on House Bill one so
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
those sections that I gave you the back
 
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
of the budget sections of house bill one
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
because remember we do have two separate
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
bills we have to deal with here it look
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
it's um I don't have a hard copy but
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's the it was yes no not House Bill
 
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.269 align:start position:0%
it's the it was yes no not House Bill
one

00:27:06.269 --> 00:27:06.279 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:27:06.279 --> 00:27:08.269 align:start position:0%
one
yeah

00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
21165 yeah it's it's the actual cover
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
page of house bill one and then just the
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
back of the budget
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
sections the big portion of house bill
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
one is your big budget book that's not
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
printed in that this is just a small
 
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
document of just the back of the budget
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
sections so sections two and four are
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
assigned to
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
two to decide on and both are
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
boilerplate consistent sections of house
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
B one that have existed for years
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
um so it' be section two of that bill
 
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
that you have in your hand I think it's
 
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
on page 7even it says
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
723 yeah yeah so on line 28 you'll see
 
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:58.509 align:start position:0%
723 yeah yeah so on line 28 you'll see
the

00:27:58.509 --> 00:27:58.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
so so what did you oh back to the budget
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
section okay here we go well I mean we
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
could hold off on these this is fine no
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
no no let's keep moving so you said line
 
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
28 page 723 L yeah got
 
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
it section two and four yeah I I I
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
actually am going to suggest perhaps
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
holding on two section two until you
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
decide what you're going to do with the
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
university and Community College systems
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
budget we probably won't change it but
 
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
just in case I think it's good to just
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
have that okay section four the Lottery
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
Commission I think you could just give
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
that a thumbs up if nobody had any any
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
issues with that one L 11 line 11 on
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
yeah page 724 is what the header says
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
deleted it appeared in both bills out of
 
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
the governor's office so we just deleted
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
it from House Bill two it always resides
 
00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
in house bill
 
00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:15.799 align:start position:0%
one yeah yes so just as a reminder to
 
00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
everyone um we have time to review the D
 
00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
thing so don't feel the pressure when
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
you look at a paragraph take a few
 
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
seconds to read it because it's much
 
00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
easier to express a concern before we
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
the vote on it then to then reconsider a
 
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
vote and start anchoring with stuff with
 
00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:34.519 align:start position:0%
approved so take a few seconds we have
 
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
the time we're getting it done so
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
everything here is new in hb1 we need to
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
approve all these sections as well
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
essentially is that
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
accurate uh is this just hb1 so this is
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
just House Bill one the back of the
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
budget sections House Bill one that
 
00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:50.919 align:start position:0%
everyone always refers to like the
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
budget lines that's section one of host
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 these are the sections two and
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
after that we're talking about so we're
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
not talking about funding levels here
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a couple like
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
footnotes essentially of the and we need
 
00:30:03.789 --> 00:30:03.799 align:start position:0%
to approve each one of them just the
 
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
ones that are assigned so basically just
 
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
section two and four and then if we do
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
abolish any positions with your
 
00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:10.519 align:start position:0%
decision- making we would update the
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
section relative to abolish positions as
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
well but really sections two and four
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
two so are are we all good with this no
 
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.430 align:start position:0%
two so are are we all good with this no
no

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
okay I oh read read it read
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
it and we we are going to have voting a
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
lot next week if no one is feeling
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
prepared to do stuff today and you know
 
00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
we want to have there's no rush we we we
 
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
feel like we've already made pretty good
 
00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:47.919 align:start position:0%
progress with those four amendments
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
today so I'm I'm pleased so this is a
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
smaller section for H it we've certainly
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
had bigger we've certainly had more
 
00:30:57.549 --> 00:30:57.559 align:start position:0%
sections in this yeah would you rather
 
00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
would you rather read over the weekend
 
00:31:00.629 --> 00:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
we don't have V on today I don't know I
 
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
mean everybody else is ready it's just
 
00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:03.799 align:start position:0%
the new okay okay no no take take it
 
00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:05.559 align:start position:0%
take your time I'm going to take a break
 
00:31:05.559 --> 00:31:23.669 align:start position:0%
take your time I'm going to take a break
look

00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
it's again on the mic so people who may
 
00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
be watching know what's going on we were
 
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
reviewing the fact that this is a work
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
session therefore it's perfectly okay
 
00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:34.039 align:start position:0%
for somebody to take a minute to read
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
something and see if they're ready to
 
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
vote on it or not so we are taking that
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
time we'll uh start uh working again as
 
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
Mickey for Mr Lan for clarification the
 
00:32:35.629 --> 00:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
action that we are looking to take on
 
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
section for if nobody objects is to just
 
00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
approve it as written in the back of hb1
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
because it had already been the
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
duplicate language has been just removed
 
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
from hb2 so now the correct language is
 
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:50.519 align:start position:0%
only one place to make housekeeping
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
cool means you're not already at we
 
00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
don't have a motion do we not yet you
 
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
were out okay well not why you took over
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
um do I have a motion I would leave how
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
issues how about
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
Harry there you go
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
Harry no I'll make a motion to approve
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
uh section four of page oh sorry I'll
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
make a motion to approve section 4 of
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
page 724 in hb1 as
 
00:33:40.269 --> 00:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
Murray I guess I should add referring to
 
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:51.789 --> 00:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
discussion ready Madam clerk all in
 
00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:55.720 align:start position:0%
favor raise your
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
so so we will be deferring action then
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
per the advice of Mr landrian for
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
section two on page 723 regarding the
 
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
education budget abundance of caution
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
and all that thank you and and just a
 
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
reminder to everybody to all of these
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
are just recommendations as we go along
 
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
everything can be Revisited and has been
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
in the past and nothing's final final
 
00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
until we kind of hit hit the end of our
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
deadline so I I think we can probably be
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
done with this first page of this
 
00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:32.599 align:start position:0%
tracking sheet today tracking package um
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
but as we continue on the coming days
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
um every one of these amendments or
 
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
excuse me every one of these sections in
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill two we usually ask that you
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
vote on one way or another just so we
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
know what the committee's intent and
 
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
intent is whether it's going to stay in
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
or come out or or whatever um and and
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
this will apply to everything as we
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
continue on we are getting near the the
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
end of our um close deadline so if
 
00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
anyone has an amendment Now is really
 
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
the time to reach out to me and I'll
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
help you draft it and include it in this
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
package similar to the ones that you saw
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
in here today the technical ones um you
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
know we we're getting to the point where
 
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to start closing
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
out some things you know as the days
 
00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:15.950 align:start position:0%
out some things you know as the days
move

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
move
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
on thank you since Mr landan is bringing
 
00:35:22.589 --> 00:35:22.599 align:start position:0%
it up there was something that I think I
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
haven't managed to share with a
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
committee yet which is one of the items
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
we were discussing in um the revenue
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
committee for the fish and game um one
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
of the concerns of that committee was
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
that right now when you take a hunter or
 
00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
a you know um Trapper class you don't
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
have to pay for the class you take it
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
for free you could take the class and
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
never even apply for the exam and the
 
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
concern of the committee was that that
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
seems to be a bit wasteful because we're
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
basically giving free training to people
 
00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
who may just be wasting our time and
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
taking our slots combining that with the
 
00:35:59.550 --> 00:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
fact that the department has a tendency
 
00:36:02.589 --> 00:36:02.599 align:start position:0%
to fill its classes and not really be
 
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
able to offer new classes leading to
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
some people never being able to attend
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
one of the thoughts of that committee
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
which I'd like to share with this
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee to see if it makes sense for
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
everybody was to require people to pay
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
for the license first and then be
 
00:36:21.069 --> 00:36:21.079 align:start position:0%
allowed a free training class now there
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
is a test that needs to be taken and if
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
they fail the suggestion of the previous
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
committee was to allow them to take the
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
class pass a second time to ensure they
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
pass but the idea was that asking for
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
this would increase the number of people
 
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
that take the training class that
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
actually get the license because it
 
00:36:40.349 --> 00:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
would basically say Hey you have to
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
commit to applying for the license
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
before it will let you take the free
 
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
training class and again it's something
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
that I didn't bring up yet so I want to
 
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
bring it up now if the committee feels
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea to at least have an
 
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:55.720 align:start position:0%
amendment drafted along those lines we
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
could ask Mr L to draft it and then
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
review it and uh you know decide whether
 
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
it makes sense but I didn't want to just
 
00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:04.599 align:start position:0%
ask him to draft an amendment without
 
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
the committee opining folks I think I'd
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
wait if fishing game is coming in on
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
Monday wait and them talk about that the
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
other thing which is a little more
 
00:37:15.309 --> 00:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
compelling to me is um it has to be very
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
frustrating with all the dedicated funds
 
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
that can't be used for anything else and
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
so they don't raise the rates because
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
they're only going to have money sitting
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
there to have that a cap on it so that
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
Surplus can go to their operating and
 
00:37:29.309 --> 00:37:29.319 align:start position:0%
allow them to have the opportunity so um
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
I feel a little more if we're going to
 
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
go in a direction if we only how we can
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
go in a 100 directions hopefully we
 
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
won't um but I'm pretty much behind that
 
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
as far as I understand it now but with
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
fishing game coming in Monday I would be
 
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
happy for that but I think that's an
 
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
amendment we should consider for fishing
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
game would it be productive given that
 
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
this was discussed with them in the fall
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
and they did not really seem to be
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to it per se would it be more
 
00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
productive to maybe have an amendment Ed
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
on Monday so they can opine on the
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
language and then we can consider this
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not looking to have the amendment
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
adopted without talking to them and
 
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
giving them an opportunity but maybe if
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
we have the an initial draft of of the
 
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
amendment it make the Monday discussion
 
00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.550 align:start position:0%
amendment it make the Monday discussion
more

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:38:16.349 --> 00:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
productive uh I'm not sure we can get
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
all that I mean we would have to see if
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
we can get an amendment turned around
 
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
for Monday morning which may be tricky
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
but um I can I can work with you and and
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
start getting something drafted we can I
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to if that's the will
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee but otherwise I'm I'm
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
happy to wait if the committee feels we
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
should wait until Monday morning just
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
trying to find the most productive way
 
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
of getting that done you know we do have
 
00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of moving parts
 
00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it hurt for you to get
 
00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
here with band again and at least get
 
00:38:46.589 --> 00:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
you know start the process so who knows
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
what you're looking for whether it gets
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
done by Monday morning or not as a
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
separate issue so I'll start the process
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
on Amendment which to summarize will
 
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
require Fish and Game to charge people
 
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
who register for a class say starting
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
July 1st or whenever the budget gets in
 
00:39:02.829 --> 00:39:02.839 align:start position:0%
place right it will require it to charge
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
the people the license they would owe
 
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
for the hunting license and trapping or
 
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
whatever and um they would have two
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities to take the class in in
 
00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
included in that fee right does that
 
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
make sense that's kind of what we were
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
doing in the fall but would that be
 
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
acceptable cuz the concern was if you
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
charge them the hunter license and they
 
00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
fail the exam they'll be frustrated so
 
00:39:29.069 --> 00:39:29.079 align:start position:0%
the second time to take the hunter
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
license class for the same fee seems
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
reasonable and I think is trying um I'm
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
just curious how logistically that would
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
happen though I mean when you go to get
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
your hunter license you get your hunter
 
00:39:41.359 --> 00:39:42.589 align:start position:0%
your hunter license you get your hunter
license

00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
so how would they handle that the same
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
way they handle it right now when you
 
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
need to get your hunter's license you
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
can pay it whatever outfit you want and
 
00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
as soon as you put your application in
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
you can go and schedule your class so
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
they don't send the hunter license until
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
after the class well you cannot possibly
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
qualify for it until you pass the class
 
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
there is a written test there is a field
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
day so they already have a pretty tough
 
00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:10.839 align:start position:0%
process in terms of you know making sure
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
you are eligible and you are qualified
 
00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
this would only move the payment from
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
after everything is concluded to the
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
beginning of the process so you don't go
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
through the training class and then just
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
never apply it's wasteful I mean we're
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
spending time and money to train people
 
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
who don't
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
apply okay thank
 
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
you I was just going to say with
 
00:40:34.109 --> 00:40:34.119 align:start position:0%
everything we're going through could we
 
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:35.720 align:start position:0%
wait till you know you can I guess start
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
your process but wait till fishing game
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
gets here to um get it from the the
 
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
deer's mouth maybe
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
the I'm fine with that I I can wait I
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
mean I don't want
 
00:40:47.839 --> 00:40:50.270 align:start position:0%
mean I don't want
to

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
be I just don't know how you're going to
 
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
go get the D the hunter's license you'll
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
have the license what makes you go to
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
the class you've already got the license
 
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
you don't get the license you just pay
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
the fee and you only get your license at
 
00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
the end of the you know approval process
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
the idea is not to get people a free
 
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
ride in taking a class without ever
 
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
intending to apply for a license which
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
happens quite a few times you believe
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
that funny I by the department in uh the
 
00:41:23.069 --> 00:41:23.079 align:start position:0%
fall seem to indicate that yeah there
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
are quite a few cases of people that for
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
whatever reason take the clock and then
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
their plans change or you know they move
 
00:41:32.589 --> 00:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
or whatever and they never apply and
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
we're also again unable to serve other
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
people who want to get into classes and
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
the classes are full and the department
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
needs the revenue it's not only the
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
revenue from the license itself even
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
though that's meaningful but it's also
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know some of the Pitman Robertson
 
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
money is allocated based on how many
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
licensed people we have in the state so
 
00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:55.720 align:start position:0%
it's there are good reasons to continue
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
to help increase the number of licensed
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
hunters and Fishers and Trappers and so
 
00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
on so this is an attempt to make that
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
work a bit better it shouldn't be a huge
 
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
change in Revenue but every little thing
 
00:42:10.589 --> 00:42:10.599 align:start position:0%
helps we could just charge for the
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
class but anyway let's wait for a
 
00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.589 align:start position:0%
class but anyway let's wait for a
fishing

00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
game all right Mr so yes so to confirm
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
we will invite fishing game in for our
 
00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
10 to 12 block on Monday and like I said
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of other deliverables
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
including some of the things you talked
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
about and that and we can bring that up
 
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
too with them so just to follow up on
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
that is is that the only thing we'll be
 
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
able to get done on Monday we limit them
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
to an hour and S an hour to get some
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
other things done
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
um have you taken they did provide quite
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
a bit of information um have I read it
 
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
all no I think you'd have to be very
 
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:51.079 align:start position:0%
efficient to get through them in an hour
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
but it's possible um there's always the
 
00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
option of recessing when we're done with
 
00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:57.640 align:start position:0%
them in the morning
 
00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
until after the the exact and then we
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
could come back later in the afternoon
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
if we have stuff we wanted to get done
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just concerned I know there's a lot
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
yeah and we don't have Thursday of
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
course and we only have Friday morning
 
00:43:12.549 --> 00:43:12.559 align:start position:0%
which we I yeah because I have a I have
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
the judicial thing in the afternoon
 
00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
yeah all right so the next page we'll
 
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:21.640 align:start position:0%
jump to is Page Six of the the tracking
 
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
sheet packet and the orientation of the
 
00:43:39.069 --> 00:43:39.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
so is everybody
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
is it's uh we're in the the packet that
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
the front page looks like this and then
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
page six of this document yep all right
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
perfect so this is where
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh this is where I've captured all of
 
00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
the we'll call it uh like funding
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
changes that have e either been proposed
 
00:44:09.549 --> 00:44:09.559 align:start position:0%
by an agency an additional prioritized
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
need or just other changes discussed
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
just to try to get everything on here
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
for you to consider um and I can walk us
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
through very quickly everything here so
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
Department of safety's only funding
 
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
change request was relative to funding
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
the northern border Alliance so this was
 
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
a 600,00
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
request they came in and when they met
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
with us this was uh something they had
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
brought up uh fishing game is pretty
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
incomplete in both of these documents
 
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
here because they are they just sent a
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
whole new package yesterday like I said
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
so the only thing on here for them as of
 
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
right now was their general fund support
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
that they had testified to us when they
 
00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:49.559 align:start position:0%
came in I expect after Monday I'll
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
probably add more to this Department of
 
00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation lines three four and five
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
were there additional prioritized needs
 
00:44:58.549 --> 00:44:58.559 align:start position:0%
relative to Highway programs the
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
retention incentive program equipment
 
00:45:03.069 --> 00:45:03.079 align:start position:0%
replacement and winter maintenance uh
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
line six the transit operating match you
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
recall we had a work session with
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
Transit operators uh relative to that uh
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
Mr landrian on the Department of
 
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:13.720 align:start position:0%
Transportation requests as you go
 
00:45:16.109 --> 00:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
through them could you indicate which of
 
00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
them must be funded from the general
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
fund and which of them could be funded
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
from one of the dedicated funds they
 
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
have available I'm trying to understand
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
because that is a complicated Department
 
00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
right I don't want to use funds
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
improperly but I would like to minimize
 
00:45:32.829 --> 00:45:32.839 align:start position:0%
the use of General funds whenever other
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
funds May available even if the highway
 
00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
find for example has a structural
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
deficit we're going to try to address it
 
00:45:41.069 --> 00:45:41.079 align:start position:0%
so anything that can be spent for the
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation from from
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
one of their dedicated funds I would
 
00:45:47.309 --> 00:45:47.319 align:start position:0%
really like to hear whether it's
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
possible even if that fund right now
 
00:45:52.109 --> 00:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
does not seem to have the funds
 
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
available sure um I mean for for the
 
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
first three those are his ially just
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Highway fund appropriation
 
00:46:02.589 --> 00:46:02.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what dedicated funds at
 
00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
Transportation is is that something you
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
know again Highway fund y you know
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
obviously the turnpike fund is
 
00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.829 align:start position:0%
obviously the turnpike fund is
restricted

00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%
restricted
 
00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
but if any parts of those expenditures
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
could come from dedicated funds even if
 
00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
you don't have the answer right now and
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
please note you said historically I get
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
the history but historically and
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
possible are different things we may
 
00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
have done things a certain way for a
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
while if it's possible to do them
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
differently I'd like to explore it I'm
 
00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
just trying
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
to find
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
funds in ways that would reduce the need
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
for us to straight out cut or deny
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
requests I'm looking for ways to grant
 
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
them their requests with less of an
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
impact on the general fund so if that's
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
at all possible when you say dedicated
 
00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
funds you're including the highway fund
 
00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.309 align:start position:0%
funds you're including the highway fund
aren't

00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
you every dedic
 
00:46:59.069 --> 00:46:59.079 align:start position:0%
anything anything that's not general
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
fund no specifically when you I I think
 
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
there's some confusion here when you say
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated you're including the highway
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
fund I spe I specifically said yeah the
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
highway fund the turnpike fund any other
 
00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay so uh lines three through five are
 
00:47:20.349 --> 00:47:20.359 align:start position:0%
Highway fund requests uh line six is the
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
only general fund request of the
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
department and that is not something
 
00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
that Highway fund would be an
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate use for
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
which is why it's a general fund request
 
00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
um line seven you remember they talked
 
00:47:37.549 --> 00:47:37.559 align:start position:0%
about their P3 um the operator uh
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
agreement that they had for with do
 
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:42.280 align:start position:0%
Portsmith facilities I believe it was so
 
00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:44.839 align:start position:0%
they are trying to come up with a way to
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
restrict the revenue that they collect
 
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:48.200 align:start position:0%
for that for that purpose under the
 
00:47:50.589 --> 00:47:50.599 align:start position:0%
operator agreement
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
um they have language and you'll see it
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
um when we get to the house bill two
 
00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.510 align:start position:0%
um when we get to the house bill two
section

00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:47:58.750 --> 00:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh something we could add to house bill
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
to that just restricts the revenue in
 
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
the budget doesn't create a dedicated
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
fund they didn't seem to get a warm
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
reception to the idea of establishing a
 
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:07.640 align:start position:0%
brand new dedicated fund for this so
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
they did come up with a a workaround
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
that would at least restrict that money
 
00:48:14.589 --> 00:48:14.599 align:start position:0%
for its agreed upon use um what you see
 
00:48:16.829 --> 00:48:16.839 align:start position:0%
here would be revenue from that
 
00:48:20.589 --> 00:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
agreement $52,000 in fiscal 26 and
 
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
$78,000 in fiscal 27 just to put it in
 
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
house bill one to reflect that uh new uh
 
00:48:29.069 --> 00:48:29.079 align:start position:0%
function that they'd be
 
00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
doing line number eight is nothing you
 
00:48:33.309 --> 00:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
really have to worry about right now so
 
00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
if you recall um a portion in a
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
specifically um is a big one but also
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
some of the construction lines in the
 
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:43.640 align:start position:0%
betterment program as well as the S SP
 
00:48:47.309 --> 00:48:47.319 align:start position:0%
367 account are driven by your Revenue
 
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
estimates so for um a portion in a this
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
is your Highway block grants to cities
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
and towns so 12% of the previous years
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
Highway fund Revenue essentially motor
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle fees and road toll gets paid to
 
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
cities and towns so the numbers that are
 
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
reflected on here and then the
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
construction lines a portion of the road
 
00:49:11.069 --> 00:49:11.079 align:start position:0%
toll uh goes to the betterment program
 
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
the three cents we've heard from the
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
Department about that so the amounts
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
that are represented on here would be
 
00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
decreases to the governor's budget
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
because house Ways and Means estimates
 
00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:21.799 align:start position:0%
were a little bit lower than the
 
00:49:21.799 --> 00:49:23.270 align:start position:0%
were a little bit lower than the
governor

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
so these accounts are uh tied to Warrant
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
language that the department would still
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
just pay whatever it is this is just
 
00:49:33.549 --> 00:49:33.559 align:start position:0%
accurately reflecting in the budget what
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
we think those will be based on the
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
revenue so somewhat technical but at
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
least it it aligns your spending plan
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
with your Revenue plan the reason why
 
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
I'd say hold off on these for now is
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
this committee is discussing changing
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle fees so these would be
 
00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
changed as a result of that so we'll
 
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
we'll hold on to that to see what we do
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
with with fees can you go over that just
 
00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
again um I always don't like the
 
00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.309 align:start position:0%
again um I always don't like the
parenthesis

00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
parenthesis
 
00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh so this is money that we don't
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
basically have to find this is money
 
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
that oh sorry I should have said that at
 
00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:04.839 align:start position:0%
the begin so all of these columns
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
represent a change to the budget you're
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
working from yeah so if it's a
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
parentheses that's a reduction so this a
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
reduction from what is in the governor's
 
00:50:16.789 --> 00:50:16.799 align:start position:0%
budget because Ways and Means has so
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
we're they're assuming lower Revenue so
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
therefore we'd assume these programs
 
00:50:20.829 --> 00:50:20.839 align:start position:0%
would have lower
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
costs so this is a cost savings this
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
isn't another hole we have to fill I
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
mean yeah I mean uh you could look at it
 
00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
yeah but just keep in mind the reason
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's a savings is because the top level
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
top number the top line revenue num is
 
00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.030 align:start position:0%
top number the top line revenue num is
going

00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
down the the net the net impact of
 
00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:43.240 align:start position:0%
adjusting for the revenue change and
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
adjusting for these is a it hurts your
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
bottom line compared to the governor
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
because overall you're You're Expecting
 
00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
less Revenue so um next set is the
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
department Department of Education so
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
lines 9 through 12 um the first three
 
00:51:02.349 --> 00:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
lines are their additional prioritized
 
00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
needs they talked about their learning
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh platform software uh State Testing
 
00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
expanding to do a PSAT for 10th graders
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
and then the uh position for a state
 
00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
assessment administrator which is
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
already an existing position that is
 
00:51:20.589 --> 00:51:20.599 align:start position:0%
fully federally funded they're asking to
 
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
split it half and half general fund and
 
00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
federal fund because that position does
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
non-federal work as well so they're
 
00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
trying to expand the the use of that
 
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
position uh line 12 the uh the
 
00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
department had in their uh presentation
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
that there was 10 brand new uh positions
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
in Workforce Innovation division uh
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
relative to De uh Disability Services
 
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
determination they don't exist currently
 
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
they were put in their agency budget
 
00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
request back in August they're saying
 
00:51:52.589 --> 00:51:52.599 align:start position:0%
those can come out they're not going to
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
need or fill those so that's what you
 
00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
see there it's only federal funds not
 
00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
going to help your general fund requests
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
in any way uh and then on line 13 of
 
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
this document if you remember they they
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
provided some detail on vacant positions
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
so the commissioner had said here's some
 
00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
vacant positions that we really want to
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
keep and here are some positions that
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
could be abolished um they they provided
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
a revised estimate of that or a revised
 
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
schedule of that which I sent to you so
 
00:52:22.789 --> 00:52:22.799 align:start position:0%
the original number I think was 29
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
positions they backed it down to 20
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
here can we just go back you as as above
 
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
when you talked about um the 10 new
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
positions um on line 12 being Federal
 
00:52:41.309 --> 00:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
that really has no bearing on the budget
 
00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:43.799 align:start position:0%
that would be true also of the education
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
the um those are all federal positions
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
on line
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
13 yes in line 13 the federal positions
 
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:53.799 align:start position:0%
I think there were three General funded
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
positions and then the rest were Federal
 
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
so there is a general fun portion there
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
the GF I'm talking about the federal
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
ones Federal so those are federal and so
 
00:53:04.829 --> 00:53:04.839 align:start position:0%
the federal ones don't impact us right
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
would you take the positions
 
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
away basically what just the FED as I
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
understand the federal government
 
00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:11.799 align:start position:0%
required the positions and we don't need
 
00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:13.240 align:start position:0%
the positions so we he doesn't wants to
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
take take them out of the budget they
 
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
don't impact our general fund you're
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
right but there's no money to take out
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
since they're Federal it does not affect
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
us it's just it's more housekeeping
 
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
almost yes yeah you would uh align your
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
budget document House Bill one with I
 
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
guess anticipated um programmatic uses I
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
guess of the department I think the
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner had stated he didn't expect
 
00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:35.720 align:start position:0%
he'd be able to fill those
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
positions um and if he could if for
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
instance they have the money and are
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
able to hire they could come to the
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and establish a
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
temporary position through the bium to
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
and do that so this would be a uh just
 
00:53:52.349 --> 00:53:52.359 align:start position:0%
to reflect in your house bill one that
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
you're not anticipating those positions
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
Ro just curious how many were um the FED
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
positions do we know I'd have to double
 
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
check I believe it was three general
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
fund and on line
 
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
13 uh three of them were general fund
 
00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:13.799 align:start position:0%
and the remainder remain yeah we're
 
00:54:17.549 --> 00:54:17.559 align:start position:0%
Federal thank you repr papovich thank
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
you and and just to be clear as a former
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
CPA I agree that the FED funds do not
 
00:54:26.109 --> 00:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
directly impact our budget but carrying
 
00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
those positions when we don't need
 
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
them just tends to confuse matters when
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
you budget because now you have a budget
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
that's bigger than it should be and then
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
you got to account for the fact that
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
they are on field so while it doesn't
 
00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
impact the budget having a clearly a
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
more readable budget that easier to read
 
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
benefits both the department us and
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
everybody who's trying to understand the
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
you know department of education budget
 
00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:55.640 align:start position:0%
so yeah I wish we could save more money
 
00:54:57.549 --> 00:54:57.559 align:start position:0%
there instead inad of just saying well
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
Federal money it's in and out but it
 
00:55:03.309 --> 00:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
does provide much needed Clarity and a
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
clear direction to the department so I
 
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
think it's still good measures to take
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
even though we don't benefit you know as
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
much as we'd
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
like and that and those two lines line
 
00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
12 and 13 if you're ultimately going to
 
00:55:20.589 --> 00:55:20.599 align:start position:0%
going to want to do those or a
 
00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:23.240 align:start position:0%
combination of them or in some variation
 
00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
I personally would ask that you do it
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
maybe on the front end of next week
 
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
because there is some budget entry data
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
entry involved with that that I would
 
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
have to handle and it would just be
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
something that I would prefer more time
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
on I don't know if you would need more
 
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
information relative to those if we
 
00:55:37.789 --> 00:55:37.799 align:start position:0%
could we could always track that down
 
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
for you but um that could be something
 
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:43.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps you consider early on next
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
week I personally I would be comfortable
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
acting now but recognizing that most of
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
my colleagues may want to review
 
00:55:52.029 --> 00:55:52.039 align:start position:0%
specific I would suggest specific
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
information I would suggest we add this
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
to the Monday morning after fishing game
 
00:55:59.789 --> 00:55:59.799 align:start position:0%
discussion and you know maybe Mickey if
 
00:56:02.349 --> 00:56:02.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr landrian if you can have that
 
00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
detail list of the positions to because
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
that seems to be where the questions are
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
coming from which positions are the
 
00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:10.039 align:start position:0%
exactly how many of each and whatnot so
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
if we have a nice list pulled from the
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
list of positions that he has on Monday
 
00:56:21.309 --> 00:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
this so moving on lines uh 14 through 16
 
00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
so we heard from the Department of
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
Education losing track of days um Monday
 
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
afternoon and uh as part of the
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon session um there was
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
discussion about the estimates relative
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
to charter school funding and efas and
 
00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
EFA phaso grants so the numbers on here
 
00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
are the difference between the estimates
 
00:56:50.349 --> 00:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
provided by the department and what the
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
governor funded those programs at under
 
00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
current law um we have a couple bills
 
00:56:59.069 --> 00:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
coming this way House Bill 115 relative
 
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
to EFA eligibility and House Bill 563
 
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
relative to adequacy
 
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
um at some point we'll probably have a
 
00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
big day of Ed funding type discussions
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
this is just carried on here to show if
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
you wanted to fully fund at the
 
00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
Department's estimates this is how much
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
it would be above and beyond the
 
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
governor's budget but like I said
 
00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
depending on what you do with those
 
00:57:23.549 --> 00:57:23.559 align:start position:0%
bills and if you incorporate them into
 
00:57:25.029 --> 00:57:25.039 align:start position:0%
your budget package these numbers may
 
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:27.640 align:start position:0%
change and and we'll track
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
that line 17 um we did hear that Bedford
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
approved full day
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
kindergarten so the numbers carried on
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
here are uh reflective of the state
 
00:57:43.029 --> 00:57:43.039 align:start position:0%
paying adequacy on the remaining half of
 
00:57:45.549 --> 00:57:45.559 align:start position:0%
those students for first year of
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
implementation would be the 25 26 school
 
00:57:49.789 --> 00:57:49.799 align:start position:0%
year coming up and then those kids would
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
be part of full adequacy uh after that
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
we may get slightly revised numbers I'm
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
carrying a half a million dollars here
 
00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
the department going to give me more
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
true numbers it probably won't move a
 
00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
ton but that's something that I think we
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
kind of have to carry under current law
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
that's what they would get paid so that
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
to me is somewhat of a surplus statement
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
adjustment we would just carry
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
kindergarten aid for Bedford as an
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
anticipated cost at the department will
 
00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:15.069 align:start position:0%
anticipated cost at the department will
will

00:58:15.069 --> 00:58:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:19.240 align:start position:0%
have U moving on uh Lottery Commission
 
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
came in with two requests one for the
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
security system one for the Ada building
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
uh compliance improvements those are
 
00:58:29.029 --> 00:58:29.039 align:start position:0%
sweep Stakes funds
 
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:31.480 align:start position:0%
um I'll leave it at that you guys can
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
decide if you want to uh fund those
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
not weren't those in their presentation
 
00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
they were talking about yes that okay
 
00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
and and that's that's what this document
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
is is meant to do is compile all of
 
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
those requests from all the agencies
 
00:58:50.829 --> 00:58:50.839 align:start position:0%
that either came in during their
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
presentations to you or maybe have come
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
since then and I'm just trying to
 
00:58:56.109 --> 00:58:56.119 align:start position:0%
compile everything so nothing Falls to
 
00:58:57.789 --> 00:58:57.799 align:start position:0%
the cracks here just wanted to make sure
 
00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
yep that is it is the same request they
 
00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.029 align:start position:0%
yep that is it is the same request they
spoke

00:59:01.029 --> 00:59:01.039 align:start position:0%
spoke
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
to uh police standards and training on
 
00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
page seven uh I have it broken up as two
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
separate items here um they did ask to
 
00:59:11.789 --> 00:59:11.799 align:start position:0%
unfund one of their generally funded
 
00:59:14.589 --> 00:59:14.599 align:start position:0%
positions and transfer that money into
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
class 27 to pay for an oit position it's
 
00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
a net zero change um this was their only
 
00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:24.710 align:start position:0%
a net zero change um this was their only
budget

00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
request n Z change I think except that
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
right now that position where on funding
 
00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:33.079 align:start position:0%
was vacant anyway so we were expecting
 
00:59:35.789 --> 00:59:35.799 align:start position:0%
it to lapse so in a sense they are
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
asking for new money they are just
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
trying not to create a new appropriation
 
00:59:43.029 --> 00:59:43.039 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to make sure I recap the
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
discussion correctly right so right now
 
00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
they don't have the it and they don't
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
have that position filled they would
 
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
like to get the it position and they are
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
eliminating the appropriation need by
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
trading off as it were of vacant
 
00:59:59.789 --> 00:59:59.799 align:start position:0%
position but they are getting a new
 
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
employee technically we could unfunded
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
position not approve their it and have a
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
saving there if we so
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
decide that's correct thank
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
you it's it's Net Zero in their budget
 
01:00:14.799 --> 01:00:18.589 align:start position:0%
you it's it's Net Zero in their budget
proposal

01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.069 --> 01:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
yeah so that concludes the um funding
 
01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
impact changes I have from the
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
Departments that they brought through
 
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
um again if if a member would like to
 
01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:31.720 align:start position:0%
you know make a motion on one of those
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
and support that or some variation of it
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
or do something else that an agency
 
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
never brought up like you want to reduce
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
a a line by this amount or add amount to
 
01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
this you can work with me and I can come
 
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
up with an amendment I would add it to
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
this put an amendment you know separate
 
01:00:46.029 --> 01:00:46.039 align:start position:0%
one so people can see what you're
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
looking to do um but those I just ask we
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
start getting those out you know
 
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
probably first and next week hopefully
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
we start start that
 
01:00:57.069 --> 01:00:57.079 align:start position:0%
discussion all right next moving on is
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh the bills that we've had so the first
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
subset here is bills that we've already
 
01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
had work sessions on so House Bill 129
 
01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
was relative to evidence-based
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
definition within public education the
 
01:01:11.029 --> 01:01:11.039 align:start position:0%
department of Ed had asked for a
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
position in their fiscal note the bill
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
itself does not have an appropriation or
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
authorization for a position we retain
 
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
that bill so at this point it would stay
 
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:25.039 align:start position:0%
retained the bill would stay retained if
 
01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:27.319 align:start position:0%
this committee want to add that language
 
01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
to house bill to or or and or uh fund a
 
01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
position that the department says you
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
can you can do it any which way you want
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
you could add it to House Bill 2 and not
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
provide any funding you could add it to
 
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 and provide the position or
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.349 --> 01:01:56.359 align:start position:0%
committee similarly house bu
 
01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
133 um this one was slightly different
 
01:02:01.269 --> 01:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
in that it did have a general fund
 
01:02:03.549 --> 01:02:03.559 align:start position:0%
appropriation in the bill uh we also
 
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
retained this bill so it's subject to
 
01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
working with the Department
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
um but they had also suggested in
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
addition of the $40,000 for software
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
that they would need a position to
 
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
administer um the changes in the bill
 
01:02:20.109 --> 01:02:20.119 align:start position:0%
again it's up to the committee to decide
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
if you want to include this legislation
 
01:02:23.269 --> 01:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
in your house bill too and then whether
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
I will Al also point out yesterday I
 
01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
think it was House Bill 763 relative to
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's like aeds and sports and public
 
01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
schools that that bill passed and I'm
 
01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
not sure why but was not referred to
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
finance there was a small $80,000 a year
 
01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation in that bill
 
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
so the Surplus statement for the house
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
finance committee's overall U budget
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
will carry $80,000 a year to the
 
01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety for that bill it
 
01:02:58.990 --> 01:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
didn't come to us for review but that
 
01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
was $160,000 spend over the
 
01:03:04.269 --> 01:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
bayum unrelated to this bill but
 
01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
related I think it was 763 I had to
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
double check the number but it was
 
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
relative to AED availability in in
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
sports in schools so if it is an
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
increase how do we handle that because
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
you know potentially just you know
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
hypothetically what if it is something
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't fund
 
01:03:29.789 --> 01:03:29.799 align:start position:0%
so the way we handle it is we'll carry
 
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
on the Surplus statement of the house
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
finance committee's overall plan a spend
 
01:03:35.789 --> 01:03:35.799 align:start position:0%
an appropriation adjustment of $80,000 a
 
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
year if this committee doesn't want to
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
approve that which in the past this has
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
happened you could put something in
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 that says the provisions of
 
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
house bill whatever of the 2025 session
 
01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
shall not take effect so it's clearly as
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
part of your budget package you don't
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
want to spend or you don't want to spend
 
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
the money that the house as a body
 
01:03:56.029 --> 01:03:56.039 align:start position:0%
passed so you're kind of undoing the
 
01:03:58.029 --> 01:03:58.039 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of that if you recall I
 
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
think we did that two years ago with a
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
um a school nutrition related bill yeah
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
so will you be including a reference to
 
01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
that on the Surplus statement so we can
 
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
actually see that in yeah I mean it's a
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
small number obviously and uh you may
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
not see a surplus statement until after
 
01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
the division's done its work right so
 
01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
usually we don't compile a surplus
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
statement in in its final form that
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
you're used to seeing until all the
 
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
division recommendations are done I I
 
01:04:26.109 --> 01:04:26.119 align:start position:0%
thought you were carrying the the bills
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere that have passed we're
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
carrying them but I'm just saying as far
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
as a document that's public we we don't
 
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
update the the quote Surplus statement
 
01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
this is this is a general fund
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
expenditure so I'll update education
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
trust fund Highway and um fishing game
 
01:04:41.309 --> 01:04:41.319 align:start position:0%
for you since that's kind of contained
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
to this committee the general fund
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement we're not going to
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
update regularly because all three
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
divisions are working simultaneously
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
Mike Kane in our office is he's tracking
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
all that daily but he's not putting out
 
01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
a new document necessarily every day so
 
01:04:55.069 --> 01:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
I guess I just trying to understand how
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
we might be reminded of it would it
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
would it appear here or just nowhere um
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
you don't have to do anything else at
 
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
this point unless you want to undo it
 
01:05:03.269 --> 01:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
well I understand that but sound mean I
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
I can add it to the list I could add it
 
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
to um just as a note on here as a
 
01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
reminder yeah as but I don't want
 
01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
to yeah I'll come up with a way to
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
present that yeah come with a new a new
 
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
new chart or whatever new
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
table there you
 
01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:21.640 align:start position:0%
go I just want to I just want to make it
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
clear would it's not a decision division
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
two made at this point it was
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
house but at least I'll list it as
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
something you
 
01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:33.799 align:start position:0%
can uh the next three bills are well
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
we'll go one at a time I guess the math
 
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
learning communities this is another
 
01:05:40.109 --> 01:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
bill we're going to retain um this is
 
01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
part of ccsnh H's budget line which
 
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
jumping back up to the previous section
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
usnh and ccsnh did not have any requests
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
so that's why they were not included in
 
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
the first listing that we went through
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
we retained that we were I'm sorry sorry
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
we retain the idea of the funding we're
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
passing the house bill 494 of the policy
 
01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
yeah we're passing the statutory changes
 
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
of that's the otpa recommendation for
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
Monday right the informal retain is the
 
01:06:11.069 --> 01:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
considering what to do with the funding
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
because the appropriation was taken out
 
01:06:18.269 --> 01:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
passed I'll go slightly out of order
 
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
House Bill 716 dual and concurrent
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
enrollment same thing uh that bill is
 
01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
retained so math learning communities
 
01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
dual and concurrent enrollment will be
 
01:06:30.349 --> 01:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
considered with wherever you decide to
 
01:06:33.069 --> 01:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
land with ccsnh H's overall funding and
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
how you want to earmark dollars for
 
01:06:35.039 --> 01:06:38.829 align:start position:0%
how you want to earmark dollars for
specific

01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
programs and then lastly House Bill 7
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
671 the kindergarten literacy Readiness
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
we heard from folks earlier this week on
 
01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
that I think it was this week um maybe
 
01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
it was last week uh so this was the
 
01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
contract cost presented by the
 
01:06:56.349 --> 01:06:56.359 align:start position:0%
department Department of Education
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
$600,000 a year as well as some small
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
costs for the uh uh HHS had some related
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
uh cost of the bill
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
so those items will
 
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
essentially unless somebody asks me for
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
an amendment if we don't draft anything
 
01:07:15.269 --> 01:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
and put in House Bill two they
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
through like won't go anywhere so those
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
those bills are retained right the money
 
01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
and everything about these bills was
 
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
retained so they'll just stay retained
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
unless you add them to House Bill
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
2 all the way through we'll see the
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
begin in
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
January I had a question about that last
 
01:07:40.029 --> 01:07:40.039 align:start position:0%
spell Mr chair um Mickey I thought there
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
was a dollar appropriation for 671 but
 
01:07:44.349 --> 01:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
when I look on your sheet you've got the
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
600,000 that they thought it would
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
actually cost to run the program yeah so
 
01:07:49.789 --> 01:07:49.799 align:start position:0%
are you just reading between the lines
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
there I'm I'm telling you the cost yeah
 
01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
the there was a dollar appropriated for
 
01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
that one the if you wanted to fully fund
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
the the agency request that's what's
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:05.309 --> 01:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
thank uh next section so 20 lines 26
 
01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
through 31 these are bills that were uh
 
01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
referred to us yesterday with the
 
01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
exception of House Bill 713 that was the
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
week before um I'll very quickly go
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
through these EFA Bill we talked about
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
that uh House Bill 563 calculation of
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
adequacy Grants we're going to have to
 
01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
dive into that
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
bill house bill 675 this was the limit
 
01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
on School District Appropriations the
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
local budget cap I guess we'll call it
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
there's no State impact there so um
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's why there's zero dollars carried
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
um mile marker on Route 112 House Bill
 
01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
713 the Department of Transportation um
 
01:08:46.829 --> 01:08:46.839 align:start position:0%
estimated about three a quarter of a
 
01:08:48.510 --> 01:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars of federal funds that
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
they could use for that but it would
 
01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
maybe displace other
 
01:08:51.839 --> 01:08:53.630 align:start position:0%
maybe displace other
projects

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
um catastrophic Aid special head and
 
01:08:58.590 --> 01:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
then the cell phone
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
bill on 713 the mile markers on Route
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
112 I just wanted to get an idea from
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
the committee if they feel that we need
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
to debate a lot or that's something that
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
we can just approve and move on it seems
 
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
to be a policy decision that was clearly
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
made by the house and it's Federal money
 
01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
I think the department can handle the
 
01:09:20.829 --> 01:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
prioritization of their Federal money
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
just fine I'm just trying to see if we
 
01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
can get something off the table cuz it's
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
a darn table and it's creaking and uh
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
you know do we necessarily need to
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
notice that we're voting on it we do
 
01:09:34.269 --> 01:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately so we'll have to push
 
01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:36.199 align:start position:0%
maybe till Monday we could do that so
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
this this is a question now that we've
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
kind of gone through these we'll have to
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
schedule a work session on these
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
remaining bills the work session not yet
 
01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:44.510 align:start position:0%
remaining bills the work session not yet
completed

01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
completed
 
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
so we there's a couple ways we could do
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
this we could split it up into easier
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
um uh you know do the easy ones and get
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
those out and then save some of these
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
education ones and have a longer work
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
session dive in deeper on those or do
 
01:10:02.149 --> 01:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
them all the same day and just vote on
 
01:10:03.229 --> 01:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
them or how you want to do but at this
 
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
point the only day we're talking about
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
or the earliest we're talking about
 
01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
would be Friday so we're meeting Monday
 
01:10:10.669 --> 01:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
Tuesday Wednesday and Friday next week
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
but you can't but how are you going to
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
notice them they're in the calendar as
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
budget work sessions now so we've got it
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
reserved and I can notice a a calendar
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
notice or seriously not a calendar note
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's just a posting I I think it's 48
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
Hours 2 I have to check check with the
 
01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
clerk but I've already put in a request
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
to Janet to say if we posted a work
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
session today what's the earliest we can
 
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
schedule it for okay and so maybe it's
 
01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
Tuesday maybe it's Wednesday but
 
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
whatever day that is I'd like to get
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
these off our table I would um but then
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
the question is how much time would you
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
want to a lot for these
 
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
discussions like did you want to really
 
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
dive into each of the bills during this
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
work session or do you just want to have
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
a bang out the work session retain you
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
know pass what you can quickly like
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
we've done in the past and then have a
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
longer day talking about budget
 
01:10:58.350 --> 01:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
education trust F that sort of thing and
 
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
that's where it's up to the committee to
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
decide well my sense is well when it
 
01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
comes to the that part of the budget
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
with Charter Schools and all that kind
 
01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
of thing is there's probably need a
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
longer day and some of these are
 
01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
included in that so those I don't think
 
01:11:12.189 --> 01:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
would get banged out but the ones that
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
could get banged out I'd like to do as
 
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
early as possible you you could you
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
could uh I mean you could just have a
 
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
little like just open discussion here is
 
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
is your intention to and I'm going to go
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:30.189 --> 01:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
retain I don't know about 675 where
 
01:11:31.390 --> 01:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
anyone wants to go with that I'm just
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
thinking how quickly could you just vote
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
on these and then just get to that next
 
01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
step like the like representative
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
papovich Miller just said SE 713 you
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
maybe could just pass but then 773 781
 
01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
those are part of your budget so you
 
01:11:48.669 --> 01:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
just retain those and discuss those as
 
01:11:48.679 --> 01:11:49.870 align:start position:0%
just retain those and discuss those as
part

01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.390 align:start position:0%
part
of

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
so um I guess we could talk about the
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
retain part of it but that's not that's
 
01:11:58.270 --> 01:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
just sort of putting off the I mean at
 
01:11:59.870 --> 01:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
this point once we discuss them aren't
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
we to the point of doing something
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
Beyond saying retain and wait for
 
01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
another day because we're gonna be out
 
01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
of days so yes but I'm just thinking if
 
01:12:11.070 --> 01:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
if the intention we we've just got to
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
get a requirement done out of the way
 
01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:14.679 align:start position:0%
have a work session on these bills take
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
a vote on those bills but I think you
 
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
could just dispose of them pretty quick
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
in that regard but then have a longer
 
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
work session to dive all them I to
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
concur with Mr landrian I think we got
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
to get the notice out of the way as fast
 
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
as we can so everybody has the notice
 
01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:31.960 align:start position:0%
and we've met that we all know that
 
01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
we'll probably need more time to figure
 
01:12:36.189 --> 01:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
everything out but if we could schedule
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
a work session for all the bills that we
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
did not complete a work session on that
 
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
will take care of the notice issue and
 
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
then if we can solve it during that work
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
session great if not we have a very
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
short time to continue working on them
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
but this needs to get out get be you
 
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
know get get done and get out of the way
 
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
so we don't have further delays yeah
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
once you make an a vote to retain now we
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
can discuss those issues as part of our
 
01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
regular budget work sessions which we've
 
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
got scheduled I'm going to schedule them
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
every day basically from here on out how
 
01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
many days um but at least it gets that
 
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
requirement out of the way this
 
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
committee does an official a vote on
 
01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
each bill you know check that box and
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
then we can so ASAP I think so and I I
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
mean I think you get through all your
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
votes in probably an hour I mean I know
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
these are issues you're going to debate
 
01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
much more but they could be debated as
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
part of a budget work session not necess
 
01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily a work session on each
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
individual bill because the likelihood
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
of and I'm speaking way out of turn here
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
my sense is there's a maybe one or two
 
01:13:35.229 --> 01:13:35.239 align:start position:0%
of these bills you'll pass the rest
 
01:13:37.229 --> 01:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
you'll retain and debate them as part of
 
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
the budget yeah and honestly I just want
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
to get to the no more other no more
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
requirements other than General budget
 
01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
work sessions because we have a lot of
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
work to do and all this stuff takes away
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
from that and could delay it so I'd like
 
01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
this done as early as we can practically
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
not it with you know whever the chair
 
01:13:59.910 --> 01:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
feels right but personally I'd like to
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
on go
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
ahead um so can you walk through again
 
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused uh using the word
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
retain um and then having work sessions
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
um I think you know we've got a whole at
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
least a day's work here on anything
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
that's related to education so it seemed
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
to me that we'd be looking at a whole
 
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
day of discussion on these bills and
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
then making the motion of whether or not
 
01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
you know making a motion on what to do
 
01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
with them after we've had those work
 
01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:39.400 align:start position:0%
sessions because I was hearing retain
 
01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
and then work session so now I'm
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
confused about the sequence so let me
 
01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
speak to that I think what he's saying
 
01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
what representative PES is saying was we
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
would just
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
well speak for
 
01:14:54.669 --> 01:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
myself we would take votes on retaining
 
01:14:54.679 --> 01:14:56.070 align:start position:0%
myself we would take votes on retaining
them

01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:14:59.629 --> 01:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible and some of them
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
maybe we can actually get dispose of
 
01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
beyond that but get get the voting out
 
01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
of the way on that motion just as we
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
would have voted to retain just as I
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
would have voted to retain some of these
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
other bills earlier and we're not going
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
to talk about them until later next week
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
or or the following week so the same
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
situation handle the posting make the
 
01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
make the motion to whatever you can make
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
a motion of your choice and we'll see
 
01:15:25.629 --> 01:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
how it goes
 
01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
but then have the actual but then have
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
the actual debate in terms of the let's
 
01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
say let's just assume for a moment
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
they're retained then have the actual
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
debate over what to do about imp putting
 
01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
them in the budget or not putting in the
 
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
budget further on so when you're saying
 
01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible that's not a
 
01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
euphemism for now oh well if if possible
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
yes but he has to notice that so the
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
soon as there'll probably be next
 
01:15:47.229 --> 01:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
Tuesday or
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
Wednesday meeting notice requirements I
 
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
mean it's got to be done
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
properly representative Celly so so I'll
 
01:15:57.070 --> 01:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
just sort of summarize what's in my mind
 
01:15:59.310 --> 01:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a technical thing where
 
01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.910 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a technical thing where
we're

01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
retaining not killing it's still alive
 
01:16:06.669 --> 01:16:06.679 align:start position:0%
but because of the technicalities of
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
trying to notice it in a time frame we
 
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
keep the bills and we can discuss them
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
so you are accurate but I just to be
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
clear about what's happened already
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that prevent somebody
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
from making an itl motion and trying to
 
01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
kill it and we would take a vote on that
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
and but and then it would be dead or at
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
least would then go to the floor be dead
 
01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
right or a motion to retain would be had
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
we' vote on that and then we wouldn't
 
01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
have to deal with it right then in terms
 
01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
of what we're going to do with it put in
 
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
the budget or let it ride until January
 
01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
we then pick take it up further on next
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
week or early next the following week
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
everybody well Mr chair if I could just
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
um add the Democratic perspective to
 
01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
this discussion is that it's clear to me
 
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
that you're willing to expedite the itl
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
bills that might be something that we
 
01:17:00.189 --> 01:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
favor um to get those out of the way so
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
that you can continue deliberating over
 
01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
the Appropriations for the bills that
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
you would like to retain so um I feel
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
like if we are going to notice this and
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
run to the finish line that we should
 
01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
just acknowledge it that you know this
 
01:17:15.149 --> 01:17:15.159 align:start position:0%
is a fast track for some bills and
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
others they'll be able to have longer
 
01:17:19.149 --> 01:17:19.159 align:start position:0%
discussions I think you misunderstood me
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
I thought the it Tales would come from
 
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just basing this on
 
01:17:29.550 --> 01:17:29.560 align:start position:0%
past over the my limited time with you
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
all and what we've done over the past
 
01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:33.159 align:start position:0%
few weeks but they could go either way
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
anybody could make an ideal motion or
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
retain motion and we would get it we
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
would and since I seem to have sparked a
 
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
lot of this discussion I'll say that my
 
01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
expectations that will retain all the
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
bills that we cannot decide in a brief
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
session will decide on those where we
 
01:17:50.910 --> 01:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
have broad support in the committee that
 
01:17:52.629 --> 01:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
we can dispose of them one way or the
 
01:17:54.990 --> 01:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
other and then just get the notice
 
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
requirement of the out of the way so we
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
can finalize the work on the budget I
 
01:18:01.629 --> 01:18:01.639 align:start position:0%
mean you know that's
 
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
all we certainly will need to have an
 
01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
education work session maybe a full day
 
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
so all of these bills at least at least
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
four of them maybe five of them are ripe
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
for retain and all those topics will be
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
discussed and then for them to get into
 
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
the budget they'll require an amendment
 
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
that'll require a vote so um I think
 
01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
just like representative Kelly it's
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a technicality here let's
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
get the requirement of the work session
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
on those bills take a vote on those
 
01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
bills so we have a position on those
 
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
bills but the subject matter is probably
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
going to be deferred to a work session
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
and amendments as part of House Bill two
 
01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
and House Bill one and two later on does
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
that make
 
01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
sense yeah representative
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
Dy just so that I'm clear on this is it
 
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
are we retaining these because they just
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
passed down in the house and then we get
 
01:18:55.709 --> 01:18:55.719 align:start position:0%
to talk about them now
 
01:18:57.709 --> 01:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
no we can't do anything today no I don't
 
01:18:59.629 --> 01:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
mean today but I'm I'm saying that's why
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
we're retaining them because they just
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
passed yeah yeah yeah these just passed
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
the other day okay so we have not yet
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
considered them so we've already we
 
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
haven't heard anything about them we
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
haven't okay I just want to make sure
 
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
that the audience and myself knows
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
exactly why we're doing this right so
 
01:19:13.390 --> 01:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
we've already been through a number of
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
bills which we then going to be
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
executing tomorrow on full Finance these
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
are bills that just came to us that
 
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
eventually we have to deal with but more
 
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
importantly subsequent to that we then
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
have to really deal with them in terms
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
of how we put them into into the budget
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
or are we not putting okay I just wanted
 
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
you is everyone good with where we're at
 
01:19:39.310 --> 01:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
with all of the requests that's and this
 
01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
is this is what I have is everything at
 
01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
this point um until we get to the next
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
house B two thing but I want to get you
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
out of here at noon today if I can as
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
well so moving to the next page yeah if
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
it's me you're rushing for I I I can you
 
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
know I can get past noon it be 12 30
 
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
maybe even 1 my next meeting is at two
 
01:19:59.790 --> 01:19:59.800 align:start position:0%
up at the granite place okay uh the next
 
01:20:01.149 --> 01:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
page you'll see is uh somewhat
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
underwhelming as far as detail this is
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
this is what you've these are the
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
decisions you've made to
 
01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
date so just so so as as uh as you start
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
making um uh motions as you start making
 
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
changes adopting amendments I'll
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
populate this each day and keep a
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
running tab of you know all of your
 
01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
changes to spending and Revenue by
 
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
Source well at least we didn't spend any
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
new money yet
 
01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
true and then the next three pages I can
 
01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
go through detail if you'd like but this
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
is just the an updated uh education
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
trust fund Surplus statement on line
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
seven um and then the only change to
 
01:20:47.950 --> 01:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
this from what I gave you before is if
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
you look on line
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
28 charter school funding warrants and
 
01:20:57.229 --> 01:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal 25 for division 2 the the
 
01:20:59.950 --> 01:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
non-shaded column is $3 million I was
 
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
carrying a higher number the first
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
iteration the department said the
 
01:21:05.629 --> 01:21:05.639 align:start position:0%
warrant might only be 3 million so I
 
01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:07.639 align:start position:0%
updated that that helped the overall
 
01:21:09.149 --> 01:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
picture by a few million dollars but
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's the only change from what you saw
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
before um as you can see going down to
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
line 53 over the
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
banum there 22.9 million in 26 and $79
 
01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
million in 27 required from the general
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
fund to balance the education trust fund
 
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
with just what the governor put forward
 
01:21:30.430 --> 01:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
that's where that's still effectively
 
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
point any questions on this one if not
 
01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
fund so the highway fund has two two
 
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
differences here from the last version I
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
gave you one if you look on line uh
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
13 uh House Bill 649 which was passed by
 
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
the house I think last week relative to
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspections uh carries some
 
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue loss with it so I've reflected
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
that it's about 1 and a. half million in
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
the first year and almost $3 million in
 
01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
year and then on line 19 the do
 
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
transfers uh this coming Friday a week
 
01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
from today there is about a $4.3 million
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance request so I'm I've
 
01:22:31.709 --> 01:22:31.719 align:start position:0%
included that in that number for
 
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
division two for fiscal 25 the
 
01:22:39.070 --> 01:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
14801 that request number is in there so
 
01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
that's assuming that fiscal iny that
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
that that transfer will be approved if
 
01:22:45.790 --> 01:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
not we'll revisit this but so with those
 
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
two changes in there plus where we were
 
01:22:50.350 --> 01:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
before going all the way down to the
 
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
bottom right corner you'll see we're
 
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
about $15 million hole in the highway
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
fund if I may on HB 649 right obviously
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
decreases some Revenue wouldn't there be
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
matching expenses did we ask the
 
01:23:07.229 --> 01:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation of what the
 
01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
estimate is on the impact on the
 
01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
department if that bill becomes law
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm not going to comment on
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
the chances of it making it through the
 
01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
Senate and through the governor but if
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
it does do we have an estimate of the
 
01:23:24.910 --> 01:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
reductions in expenditures from the do
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
because they would not have to
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
administer that it would be a department
 
01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
of safety would administer that and
 
01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
Beyond just the uh distribution of
 
01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
stickers I'll have to see if they have
 
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
any other direct budget items relative
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
to U vehicle inspections and see if
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
there basically if we could check
 
01:23:45.629 --> 01:23:45.639 align:start position:0%
because there should be a matching loss
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
of Revenue and loss of some expenditures
 
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
I find it actually surprising how every
 
01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
time we add a new program they get new
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
expenses but when we remove remve them
 
01:23:57.310 --> 01:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
the expenses rarely disappear not a
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
comment on a department in particular
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
just in general so I just want to make
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
sure that we are doing our due diligence
 
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
as time allows over those types of
 
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
questions yeah I can uh I can reach out
 
01:24:09.870 --> 01:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Safety and see if
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
they can ID identify any direct or even
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:26.510 align:start position:0%
 
all

01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
right and the last page here is just the
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
fishing game Surplus statement and this
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
has no changes from what I had provided
 
01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
before so it still shows that they have
 
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
a a couple million dollar Surplus at the
 
01:24:41.229 --> 01:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
end of the
 
01:24:41.239 --> 01:24:42.830 align:start position:0%
end of the
bium

01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
bium
 
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
um what jumps out is if you look on page
 
01:24:48.990 --> 01:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
or excuse me line 15 right across really
 
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
for all three years they're running out
 
01:24:52.750 --> 01:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
of deficit every year so that the reason
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
this budget balance is is they start
 
01:24:57.629 --> 01:24:57.639 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year with $13 million but
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
they end you know with just a couple so
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
you can see they're running at a a
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
deficit so this plan carried into the
 
01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
next bium would have issues but we'll
 
01:25:08.189 --> 01:25:08.199 align:start position:0%
hear way more on this Monday morning I
 
01:25:08.199 --> 01:25:37.950 align:start position:0%
hear way more on this Monday morning I
think

01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
are you done are we done that's the end
 
01:25:42.990 --> 01:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
of that document I don't know if there's
 
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
any other questions with with this as an
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
entire uh package or anything that
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
anyone has questions or wants to talk
 
01:25:50.910 --> 01:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
about have we been through all of them
 
01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
other than the hb2
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
index uh yeah
 
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think we're ever done but we may
 
01:25:59.310 --> 01:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
be at the time where we can take a break
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
you know as in we may have done
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
everything for
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
today I I do want to walk or at least
 
01:26:08.590 --> 01:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
make you aware of this document before
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
day so this is a
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
very uh informal um compilation I guess
 
01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
I'll call it of all the house build two
 
01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
changes that agencies have provided
 
01:26:28.590 --> 01:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
again not including fishing game I
 
01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
didn't have a chance to really process
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
their stuff from yesterday um and I've
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
ordered it Department of safeties first
 
01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
then Department of Transportation then
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so when would
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
you have provided this electronically uh
 
01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
I emailed this last night to everyone
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
and it is a posted on it's posted on the
 
01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
well did it come with a fishing game
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
Bunch no it was an
 
01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
email I don't know is
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.109 --> 01:27:29.119 align:start position:0%
division two track it's not that group
 
01:27:31.390 --> 01:27:31.400 align:start position:0%
right the division two I think it is in
 
01:27:33.070 --> 01:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
the division two tracking there's four
 
01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
attachments to that email it's this is
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:44.590 --> 01:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
yes sure this this document is on on the
 
01:27:47.550 --> 01:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
division 2 website
 
01:27:51.550 --> 01:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
too about the oh okay yeah
 
01:28:18.109 --> 01:28:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:20.430 --> 01:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
okay I'm with you thank
 
01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:24.280 align:start position:0%
you all right so again this is a pretty
 
01:28:26.350 --> 01:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
informal just compilation just so you'd
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
have just one packet or one document of
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
the agency's house bill to uh draft
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
language they provided so these are
 
01:28:35.709 --> 01:28:35.719 align:start position:0%
obviously not official OS amendments so
 
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
we can't act on these I'm providing
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
these to you just so you've got them and
 
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
if you do want me to draft an amendment
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
something you support something you want
 
01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
to change let me know and I'll have
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
something drafted um I think everything
 
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
in here you heard from when the
 
01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
departments were in they've done a good
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
job of there's some here that have like
 
01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
a explanation or a reason for the change
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
or synopsis so hopefully that could
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if you you know
 
01:29:04.270 --> 01:29:04.280 align:start position:0%
trying to remember why it was asked for
 
01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:05.560 align:start position:0%
um but you can reach out to me if you
 
01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
have questions on this stuff but
 
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:09.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise I'm going to just leave those
 
01:29:10.990 --> 01:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
that ball in your court and if you want
 
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
any of these drafted to just let me know
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
and then I'll include them in the packet
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
for the committee to
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
consider so these will require
 
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
individual approvals or disapprovals by
 
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
the committee or modifications no
 
01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
disapprovals really just if you do
 
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
nothing with it that's it but the these
 
01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
are just to make you aware these were
 
01:29:31.550 --> 01:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
asked for so I I had all the funding
 
01:29:33.149 --> 01:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
requests on this document here these are
 
01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
all the house bill two requests
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
effectively so um so if you want to
 
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
modify them or delete them then you need
 
01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0%
to hear from you don't have to delete
 
01:29:42.030 --> 01:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
them they're not these are not in House
 
01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 oh this is like requested changes
 
01:29:47.950 --> 01:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 2 oh oh oh I mean there
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
may be there may be one or two in here
 
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
this is the agency House Bill two
 
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
request most of it is new there may a
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
section that amends what's in here but
 
01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
chances are what's in here is what they
 
01:30:00.430 --> 01:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
requested we fixed the one safety one
 
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
that was a a mess up the rest of these I
 
01:30:05.070 --> 01:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
believe are all new to House Bill too so
 
01:30:06.669 --> 01:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
if we do nothing nothing happen they
 
01:30:10.270 --> 01:30:10.280 align:start position:0%
they all die correct okay so we do need
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
to do something if we want them right
 
01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
and that's what I'm saying if you do
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
support these requests from the agencies
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
okay and just a reminder we still have
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.149 --> 01:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
this and regarding the fishing gam have
 
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
is most of what is most of the said what
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
you sent us or is there even more that
 
01:30:35.950 --> 01:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
they have not yet sent us I've sent you
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
everything they they've sent and I'm
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
going to ask them to walk us through all
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
so I would ask all of you what what do
 
01:30:59.070 --> 01:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
you want to do with our
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
time need to read them
 
01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
yeah well do you want to do you want to
 
01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
take some time and read them or do you
 
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
just want I mean this morning or you
 
01:31:09.709 --> 01:31:09.719 align:start position:0%
want to not be you know call it a day
 
01:31:12.510 --> 01:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
and what what we've got in another I it
 
01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
would even take me it take I know it
 
01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
would take me a while to even figure out
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
what I would need to read for today than
 
01:31:21.390 --> 01:31:21.400 align:start position:0%
to just go home and read them all okay
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's fine I I just want to give you
 
01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
all whatever you want to do You're great
 
01:31:28.910 --> 01:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
and part of my part of the design for
 
01:31:30.910 --> 01:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
why I wanted to get all this is so
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully you'd have the weekend to to
 
01:31:35.070 --> 01:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
Really digest it all and and maybe come
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
up with a direction that either
 
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
individually or as a whoever you know to
 
01:31:40.590 --> 01:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
how you want to proceed with some of
 
01:31:43.149 --> 01:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
these things yeah just a quick question
 
01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
you said that you just got the fishion
 
01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
game last night and you didn't have time
 
01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
to process them are you planning to
 
01:31:51.629 --> 01:31:51.639 align:start position:0%
process some of them this afternoon and
 
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
send them to us for our review basically
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
asking if there will be an update to
 
01:31:59.870 --> 01:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
this you know before the weekend or
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
we're just going to do that on Monday
 
01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
after we talk to fishi and game I'm fine
 
01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
either way just want to know what your
 
01:32:06.990 --> 01:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
plans are I don't plan on updating this
 
01:32:09.870 --> 01:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
one again uh and all of what I received
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
you've received so um we're good and
 
01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
their requests are in there so those
 
01:32:18.030 --> 01:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
documents essentially would act as if if
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
I had had them a little sooner I would
 
01:32:22.229 --> 01:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
have tried to so there is no need to add
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
them here because we already have here
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
and then we already have the separate
 
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game email which for
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
Preparation purposes I will treat those
 
01:32:34.109 --> 01:32:34.119 align:start position:0%
requests as being part of this yep okay
 
01:32:36.189 --> 01:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
and I think that's fair and then same
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
same direction I would give you for the
 
01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
fishing game either collectively as a
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
committee when we're discussing it
 
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:43.400 align:start position:0%
Monday or individually if you want to
 
01:32:44.669 --> 01:32:44.679 align:start position:0%
support any of what they've brought
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
forward just let me know and I can have
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
some drafted we do I just didn't know if
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
there was more magic you were doing
 
01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
before you put them in the packet and
 
01:32:54.270 --> 01:32:54.280 align:start position:0%
I'm good no I mean I may if they got I
 
01:32:56.830 --> 01:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
think they had other funding requests
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
besides just the general fund support so
 
01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
I may add that to to this document here
 
01:33:04.629 --> 01:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
kind of I may add those to there once I
 
01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
understand what they're trying to do a
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
little bit um may be for Monday morning
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
maybe for Tuesday I'll I'll see I'd like
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
to do it for Monday but I'd also like to
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
hear from them too to be clear on what
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
they're looking to
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
do so I guess the other thing that while
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
we're here I would ask is is there any
 
01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:25.270 align:start position:0%
we're here I would ask is is there any
other

01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
agencies that you would like me to try
 
01:33:29.709 --> 01:33:29.719 align:start position:0%
to get them to come in on a specific day
 
01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
for a specific time to to talk answer
 
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
questions work through um just with busy
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
schedules of of the agency folk I'd like
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like to grab them sooner than later
 
01:33:39.390 --> 01:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
if you know there's people you want to
 
01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:40.470 align:start position:0%
if you know there's people you want to
talk

01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
talk
 
01:33:44.229 --> 01:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
to uh sort of maybe moot at this point
 
01:33:48.109 --> 01:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
um but I we I guess doe was expecting
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
some people from special ed to come in
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
and talk about I think more boots on the
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
ground experiences with special Leed so
 
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that was we could carve
 
01:33:58.590 --> 01:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
out a little bit of an education day for
 
01:33:59.669 --> 01:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
that I mean it's going to be a pretty
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
full day or day and a half or two um but
 
01:34:04.350 --> 01:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
I did know there were people who were
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
concerned that special ed was not here
 
01:34:07.709 --> 01:34:07.719 align:start position:0%
when we had the
 
01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:10.600 align:start position:0%
hearing and when you say special ed they
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
special ed folks or no she was talking
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
about having um a coordinator or a
 
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
supervisor super someone who has worked
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
with the special ed and I think there
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
were some questions around what does it
 
01:34:23.229 --> 01:34:23.239 align:start position:0%
really look like for a school district
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
to have a special ed student you know
 
01:34:26.990 --> 01:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
how is that what you know what is that
 
01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
year like when the student comes in um
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not necessarily making the
 
01:34:33.070 --> 01:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion but putting out there that I
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
know that there was some concern about
 
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
having a little bit more understanding
 
01:34:38.990 --> 01:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
of what's involved for a school district
 
01:34:42.270 --> 01:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
Leed so we're going to schedule those
 
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
six bills for a work session and one of
 
01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
those is the special education Aid Bill
 
01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
the formal cat Aid bill um if it if it's
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
up to the committee to the chair that
 
01:34:56.350 --> 01:34:56.360 align:start position:0%
those are of course are not public
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
hearings so it's really who would you
 
01:34:59.550 --> 01:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
like to invite up I know we talked
 
01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
earlier about quickly disposing them and
 
01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
retaining them for a future work session
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
you could use that day to hear from a
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
non-state agency if you wanted to I
 
01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
could invite someone to come talk about
 
01:35:12.510 --> 01:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
from the local perspective on special ed
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
do you know who you want to have as it
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
oh I guess we could all ask around but
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
um I think it might be an important like
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
useful perspective to just understand
 
01:35:26.189 --> 01:35:26.199 align:start position:0%
like how that can affect their
 
01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
budget I'm not averse to it what true
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
costs are I think Caitlyn had some
 
01:35:33.070 --> 01:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
people in mind so you could you know and
 
01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
that's what I just want to understand
 
01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
the intention of that work session day
 
01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
because I I think when when the FAA Bill
 
01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
an adequacy Bill a sped Bill are put in
 
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
the calendar you're going to get some
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
folks that are going to come through and
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
it's that then you know if the plan is
 
01:35:51.149 --> 01:35:51.159 align:start position:0%
to abbreviate those discussions on the
 
01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
bill retain it and then have a bigger
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
disc discussion another day you can
 
01:35:56.430 --> 01:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
decide who you want to hear from on
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
which day or just let me know what to do
 
01:35:59.790 --> 01:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
and then I can coordinate it so I just
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
want to be careful um I know I wasn't
 
01:36:04.830 --> 01:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
here on Friday but I don't want a whole
 
01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
group of people if there's a person that
 
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
you think would be appropriate and you
 
01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
could do you want Mickey to talk to
 
01:36:13.390 --> 01:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
somebody in
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
doe just ultimately a work session is up
 
01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
to the committee and you can call in who
 
01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
you want to speak so um
 
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah there's no requirement that
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
you allow everyone who comes out to
 
01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
testify no no I I do understand that I
 
01:36:30.109 --> 01:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear that that's the
 
01:36:32.189 --> 01:36:32.199 align:start position:0%
intent and then the question is who's
 
01:36:34.229 --> 01:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
going to pick the person and and I think
 
01:36:36.030 --> 01:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
I can work with Caitlyn and if she has a
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
local administrator a special ed
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
administrator that she thinks could be
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
helpful to just share from how the local
 
01:36:44.109 --> 01:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
the districts are doing Special Ed costs
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
um so if it's just a presentation and a
 
01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
Q&amp;A on our part if we could have that
 
01:36:50.350 --> 01:36:50.360 align:start position:0%
person on the same like Tuesday whenever
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
you're doing this early retain thing
 
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
that probably be the time to do it so we
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
could when we get to the big day we
 
01:36:58.750 --> 01:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
don't we're not bringing people in when
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
we're have enough time to discuss stuff
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
does that work okay I'll reach out to
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
the department and try to once I get a
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
date that in time we're going to have
 
01:37:07.149 --> 01:37:07.159 align:start position:0%
this I'll reach out to the department
 
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:15.709 --> 01:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
okay so are you all set in terms of I
 
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
think I've gone through everything for
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
today um just kind of wanted to lay all
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
that out there for you guys and kind of
 
01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:22.360 align:start position:0%
talk about the process for the next
 
01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
couple weeks it's going to go very quick
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
and we're going to have long days and um
 
01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
again I I I know I sound like a broken
 
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
record but if you have Amendment ideas
 
01:37:31.870 --> 01:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
even if it's a house bill one change get
 
01:37:34.109 --> 01:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
them to me as soon as possible uh OS
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
will be inundated with all three
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
divisions plus all the other committees
 
01:37:39.390 --> 01:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
and the Full House the full Senate doing
 
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment so we have a a time we want to
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
get everything done by so I don't want
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
to dump a bunch of stuff on them and say
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
we need all this by tomorrow you know
 
01:37:48.270 --> 01:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
it's just I want want to be realistic
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
for them too so do you all have any
 
01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
questions for me or for the committee
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
have I left anything you're good okay
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
all right I don't want
 
01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:01.719 align:start position:0%
to leave any other questions before the
 
01:38:04.109 --> 01:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
weekend I want you all to be psyched for
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
the weekend we psyched was the sped
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
administrator the only other because
 
01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
we've got fishing game Monday I'll
 
01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
invite the sped administrator do you
 
01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
want to play it by year as we go through
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
or do you want to designate days at this
 
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
point like that's going to be your
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
education day or are you not prepared
 
01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
not ready to do that yet I'm find
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
designated day if you all pick a day we
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
have and that can be something people
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
think about over the weekend and we
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
decide Monday as well you know they only
 
01:38:33.629 --> 01:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
go ahead no go
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
ahead I my only concern um that's kind
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
of lingering from other things we've
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
talked about today is the 911 search
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
charge and safety
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
um and the the intention to put the
 
01:38:49.149 --> 01:38:49.159 align:start position:0%
radio communications
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
in so and I assume you want to split
 
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
those out we actually talked about m I
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
talked about this um do you want him to
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
prepare an amendment to do that um well
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
I think there might be some intelligence
 
01:39:02.109 --> 01:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
gathering worth um considering still
 
01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
before uh we get to that phase I think
 
01:39:07.229 --> 01:39:07.239 align:start position:0%
um it would be nice to hear from someone
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
other than the commissioner about what
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
the program the 911 search charge fund
 
01:39:16.990 --> 01:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
does uh yeah I'm happy to to do some
 
01:39:18.589 --> 01:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
work on that
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
um um my concern is that I think we're
 
01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
getting one perspective when I think
 
01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
that there might be other perspectives
 
01:39:28.669 --> 01:39:28.679 align:start position:0%
and um it is a policy change not an
 
01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation change and I think that it
 
01:39:32.830 --> 01:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
might be worth hearing the other it's
 
01:39:35.229 --> 01:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
both though right um potentially well I
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
mean potentially yes right so if you're
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
adding radio communications to the
 
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
911 searge fund then that means
 
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
something that would that is currently
 
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
being funded or in the past was being
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
funded without the radio communications
 
01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
obviously something's not getting fully
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
funded anymore um because there's like a
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
new expense so um just so I'm clear so
 
01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
if if I think if we follow through with
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
what you're what you're propos and I'm
 
01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
not averse to it you would take
 
01:40:06.589 --> 01:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
something out of that fund that's
 
01:40:07.790 --> 01:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
currently being paid for that you don't
 
01:40:10.109 --> 01:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
believe should be there so that would be
 
01:40:11.870 --> 01:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
an expense somewhere else presumably for
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
safety yeah potentially right but of
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
course that's up to the you know the
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
committee's wisdom but no no of course I
 
01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
just think it's worth having a fuller
 
01:40:22.990 --> 01:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
discussion about that policy change 100%
 
01:40:24.990 --> 01:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
agree is as long as you can come up with
 
01:40:32.709 --> 01:40:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:36.270 --> 01:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
concern and uh in one of the many emails
 
01:40:38.109 --> 01:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
I've sent the department of safety did
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
provide some follow-up information and
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
there was a memo relative to that
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
discussion that may or may not help the
 
01:40:46.189 --> 01:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
discussion just wanted to remind
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
everyone of that have you already sent
 
01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
that to all of us that's sent and and
 
01:40:51.629 --> 01:40:51.639 align:start position:0%
it's posted online too if anyone needs
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
to refer to that one so regarding safety
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
specifically the fee increases do you
 
01:41:00.109 --> 01:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
think we certainly we got a a nice
 
01:41:01.390 --> 01:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
document do you think we need to hear
 
01:41:03.149 --> 01:41:03.159 align:start position:0%
from them because that would be the
 
01:41:05.229 --> 01:41:05.239 align:start position:0%
other one I would it may not hurt to
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
have them in to uh discuss that as well
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
as anything else and just if you have
 
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
questions they're here and we could we
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
could designate a couple hour window
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
just to have them be available so so
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's one I would that's what I would
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
choose that the turnpike seems like it's
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
pretty like we really don't need to do
 
01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
anything with it okay
 
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and are there any other there's
 
01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
police standards but they seem to be
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
okay what are other the little ones are
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
there uh I mean Lottery depending on
 
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
what you end up doing with VTS could you
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
know you may want to hear from them
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
again they they also will will have some
 
01:41:42.750 --> 01:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
uh position requests associated with
 
01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
that which they put in their fiscal
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
notes relative to that those positions
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
were not included in the governor's
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
budget but you know they had I think
 
01:41:53.589 --> 01:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
three positions relative to admin in a
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
compliance relative to if they took that
 
01:41:58.910 --> 01:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
on so I do have that detail um that
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
would be part of a BLT amendment I think
 
01:42:02.189 --> 01:42:02.199 align:start position:0%
so we probably should plan on them too
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
at some point but the amendment as I
 
01:42:05.310 --> 01:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
understand that that the yeah the
 
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
amendment is being drafted so hopefully
 
01:42:09.589 --> 01:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
we'll have that maybe certainly after
 
01:42:09.599 --> 01:42:10.229 align:start position:0%
we'll have that maybe certainly after
the

01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:13.390 --> 01:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
weekend and then once we have that we
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
could talk to Lottery about it yep yep
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
um and then I don't know if you need to
 
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
hear anything more from University or
 
01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
Community College or if you're set with
 
01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
what they provided that probably depends
 
01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
on where we get to with everything
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
leading up to that
 
01:42:30.669 --> 01:42:30.679 align:start position:0%
point because they have a
 
01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
big budget um so maybe um but other than
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
that is education is the big one just to
 
01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
you know and that's the one I'd like to
 
01:42:42.750 --> 01:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
sort of hit as as early as possible just
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
because it's a lot to get through and it
 
01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
has a big impact in terms of char school
 
01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
funding EFA funding all those funding
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
pieces of that adequacy part um so I
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
think that's the the most important when
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
to hit early on you're saying of
 
01:42:57.589 --> 01:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
assigning days for that can we do that
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
before the noticing or I I wasn't sure
 
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
how that was going to work I'm fine with
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
assigning days if we can I just wasn't
 
01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
sure that we I think the assigning days
 
01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
would be for our internal benefit to
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
know what your plan is for that day I'm
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to post everything in the
 
01:43:13.149 --> 01:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
calendar as budget work session to keep
 
01:43:14.669 --> 01:43:14.679 align:start position:0%
it flexible so you're not bound to that
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
one issue on that day um but I'm I'm
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
just thinking for your preparedness as
 
01:43:22.109 --> 01:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
well as if we do need an agency to come
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
in to be like hey you know we're doing
 
01:43:25.629 --> 01:43:25.639 align:start position:0%
education all day that day so safety
 
01:43:27.629 --> 01:43:27.639 align:start position:0%
don't bother coming in so all we have is
 
01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and Friday I mean assuming you
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
can notice things so we we have two no I
 
01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
know we have Monday and Tuesday but my
 
01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
point is Monday is uh just in the
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
morning for a couple hours that's
 
01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
fishing game Y and hopefully we can get
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
through fishing game and maybe something
 
01:43:41.790 --> 01:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
else and then Tuesdays as soon as you
 
01:43:42.910 --> 01:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
can notice you're not even sure you can
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
notice for Tuesday but let's let's hope
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
you can so I'm noticed for a budget I
 
01:43:50.270 --> 01:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
know that but in terms of the the the
 
01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
bills yep but even if we don't get to
 
01:43:53.950 --> 01:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
those until Wednesday you'd still have
 
01:43:57.470 --> 01:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
all day Tuesday to do anything too okay
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
so yeah you want to start an
 
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
education seems like education is going
 
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
to be the heaviest lift and um I think
 
01:44:07.950 --> 01:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
it's important to spend the given the
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
limited time that we give education all
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
the time that we need to give it so fair
 
01:44:15.229 --> 01:44:15.239 align:start position:0%
enough so but we can't do the retaining
 
01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
at that point what so how does that all
 
01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:19.390 align:start position:0%
at that point what so how does that all
work

01:44:19.390 --> 01:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
yeah educ nice to actually get something
 
01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
done as opposed to just talk about it
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
for eight hours yeah
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
um that's I was hoping we do Wednesday
 
01:44:32.430 --> 01:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe Wednesday is is the safer day
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
then yeah if if we can
 
01:44:37.149 --> 01:44:37.159 align:start position:0%
get things noticed for Tuesday or even
 
01:44:39.149 --> 01:44:39.159 align:start position:0%
Wednesday yeah let let's see what we can
 
01:44:40.709 --> 01:44:40.719 align:start position:0%
just get those Bill work session out of
 
01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
the way first and then maybe because
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
that's like the I'm hoping we can do it
 
01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
by Tuesday I don't know what the
 
01:44:47.310 --> 01:44:47.320 align:start position:0%
requirement is I haven't heard back from
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
Janet yet okay um but if we can notice
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
that today maybe that's plenty of time
 
01:44:53.709 --> 01:44:53.719 align:start position:0%
to do that Tuesday morning and then
 
01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
you have a little bit more RS on pap and
 
01:44:59.390 --> 01:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
if we plan on that notice required work
 
01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
session to be brief I mean we can use
 
01:45:03.390 --> 01:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
most of that day for a general budget
 
01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:06.639 align:start position:0%
work session right so I would I would
 
01:45:10.589 --> 01:45:10.599 align:start position:0%
budget that notice required work session
 
01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
to be brief so that we can budget a
 
01:45:15.070 --> 01:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
regular budget session on whatever
 
01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
topics for the rest of that day right I
 
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to waste time too much time
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
with that my one hesitation of doing
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
education Too Soon Is I'm expecting
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
amendments and I don't have any yet so I
 
01:45:28.750 --> 01:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
don't know what we would be doing
 
01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:32.719 align:start position:0%
Tuesday um I'm I'm I'm envisioning maybe
 
01:45:35.709 --> 01:45:35.719 align:start position:0%
your first so maybe start with safy yeah
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
you could get maybe safety and or even
 
01:45:39.070 --> 01:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
you know roll through the other sections
 
01:45:40.589 --> 01:45:40.599 align:start position:0%
a house bill too that maybe you're not
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
going to change but at least like get to
 
01:45:43.709 --> 01:45:43.719 align:start position:0%
a point where you can vote on them to
 
01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
accept them as is
 
01:45:50.430 --> 01:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
um that sort of thing is there a reason
 
01:45:55.229 --> 01:45:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
yeah the only reason why would not be we
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:06.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
and welcome to finance yeah and there
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
there is a concern we're just keeping an
 
01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
eye on the 26th is the drop dead date I
 
01:46:17.149 --> 01:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
gave you that Wednesday is that could
 
01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
also be a potential session day we're
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
hearing now so you may lose a day on the
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
back end of this I
 
01:46:27.070 --> 01:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
it's really not not great to go past
 
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
that so yeah for now we are not going to
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
plan on Saturday or weekend work but uh
 
01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
yeah it is a technical possibility so
 
01:46:37.709 --> 01:46:37.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:40.750 --> 01:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
plans so I guess safety be the one that
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
um be good to get in there especially
 
01:46:43.629 --> 01:46:43.639 align:start position:0%
because they're they actually have
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
impact on general fund stuff as well
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
some impact anyway I'll try I think
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea especially the the
 
01:46:49.629 --> 01:46:49.639 align:start position:0%
fee discussion because that's going to
 
01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
be a big part of your balancing here
 
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
right uh see if I can first I want to
 
01:46:56.189 --> 01:46:56.199 align:start position:0%
see if I can get the work sessions on
 
01:46:57.669 --> 01:46:57.679 align:start position:0%
the bills scheduled that morning and
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
then maybe safety in the afternoon it
 
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
would probably be a productive day yeah
 
01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
sorry that's Tuesday t uh Tuesday okay
 
01:47:05.470 --> 01:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
so I'll do my best to find someone for
 
01:47:06.990 --> 01:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
Tuesday afternoon if you can that'd be
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
great and I I'll I'll try to email
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
everyone by the end of today just so you
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
know if I may ask then what are we
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
planning to do on Monday just fishing
 
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
game because it looks like we may maybe
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
have a bit more time if we can find
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
something productive to do a couple
 
01:47:22.629 --> 01:47:22.639 align:start position:0%
hours in the morning oh right sorry I
 
01:47:24.510 --> 01:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
for got we have the full finance
 
01:47:27.070 --> 01:47:27.080 align:start position:0%

01:47:46.149 --> 01:47:46.159 align:start position:0%

01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
week what's going on today well what do
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about that's what's
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
going on today nothing else we can
 
01:48:14.189 --> 01:48:14.199 align:start position:0%
do got any ideas put them
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
forth I don't know the routine yet well
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
the the routine is you know what are you
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
we seem to be waiting on either
 
01:48:29.709 --> 01:48:29.719 align:start position:0%
amendments or more information on most
 
01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
topics that we could do if what the
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
chairman is saying is if you're aware of
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
a topic where we got all the information
 
01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
and we can decide go ahead but we don't
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
see one I mean that's the mar have to be
 
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
noticed that's that's a
 
01:48:45.310 --> 01:48:45.320 align:start position:0%
billed those bills are killing
 
01:48:49.229 --> 01:48:49.239 align:start position:0%
us well what what darn committee put
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's the end of the bills
 
01:48:57.229 --> 01:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
coming before crossover here we'll get
 
01:48:59.430 --> 01:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
more obviously Senate bills later but
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679 align:start position:0%
bills yeah go ahead is there ever a time
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
that these bills are passed by the house
 
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
I know this is a silly question and
 
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
we're planning for all of these
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures and then they get to the
 
01:49:14.830 --> 01:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
Senate and they kill
 
01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
them so yes so that do we have an idea
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
of which ones they're going to kill well
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
no but hang on so
 
01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for
 
01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
hb2 they can't kill bills that we put
 
01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
into hb2 so all these bills that we've
 
01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
retained the two choices we'll have are
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
let them go until January and be
 
01:49:38.669 --> 01:49:38.679 align:start position:0%
considered or more likely put them into
 
01:49:42.030 --> 01:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
hb2 hb2 is the last bill the house will
 
01:49:43.229 --> 01:49:43.239 align:start position:0%
pass and pass to the Senate now the
 
01:49:44.830 --> 01:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
Senate can mess around with it again but
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's messing around with the whole hb2
 
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:50.350 align:start position:0%
 
point

01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:49:53.550 --> 01:49:53.560 align:start position:0%
right okay does that make sense yes
 
01:49:56.510 --> 01:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
okay well that's why hb2 becomes
 
01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:02.470 align:start position:0%
okay well that's why hb2 becomes
this

01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:06.290 --> 01:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
monstrosity well so
 
01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:09.990 align:start position:0%
monstrosity well so
[Laughter]

01:50:09.990 --> 01:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
far all righty so without any further
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
comments at
 
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
11:48 I think it is I will
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
48 okay I will um declare the finance
 
01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:28.970 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:28.970 --> 01:50:32.060 align:start position:0%
