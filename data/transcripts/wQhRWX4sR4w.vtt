00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
yep for the committee my name is Frank
 
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
Guetta blue I'm the commissioner of
 
00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
education for the Department of
 
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
Education and I have some Focus Allen
 
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
Court I'm the CFO
 
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
okay and then I thought what I would do
 
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
is just start out with a basic overview
 
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
and then we can dive into details as you
 
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.509 align:start position:0%
and then we can dive into details as you
like

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
um the first page in that presentation
 
00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 align:start position:0%
is an organization chart of the agency
 
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
and as you can see we have four
 
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
different divisions
 
00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 align:start position:0%
um I will point out that the division of
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
Workforce Innovation does not have a
 
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
director and has not had a director for
 
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
over 10 years so it is a position but
 
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 align:start position:0%
it's just not a funded position
 
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh the Deputy Commissioner oversees the
 
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
principal activities in that division
 
00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
including vocation Rehabilitation as
 
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
well as SSDI
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
we've got the division of educator
 
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
analytics and resources which again is
 
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
Caitlin's division including activities
 
00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
such as assessment and accountability
 
00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
our Charter Schools our EFA our
 
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
Innovation schools all of our reporting
 
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
functions and our data activities of
 
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
which there are many
 
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
we've also got the division of learner
 
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
support and Melissa white is here I
 
00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 align:start position:0%
would drag her up here but you're out of
 
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
table space at this point in time
 
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
um and so Melissa is the director of the
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
division of learner support which
 
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
includes all of our title programs uh
 
00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 align:start position:0%
title two three four a four B idea etc
 
00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.469 align:start position:0%
title two three four a four B idea etc
etc

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 align:start position:0%
etc
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
has CTE our office of student wellness
 
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
which includes food as well as student
 
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
wellness and mental health our Esther
 
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
programming so a lot of the educational
 
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
related programming and then we have the
 
00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 align:start position:0%
division of educator support in higher
 
00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 align:start position:0%
education Stephen Appleby is for a
 
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
second so we can get a one of the
 
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.810 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
we'll give Ken that extra book as well
 
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
so uh Stephen Appleby is the division
 
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
director and that includes all of the
 
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
credentialing functions
 
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 align:start position:0%
um as well as higher education
 
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
commission and the career schools so
 
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
that is the basic uh divisional
 
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
structure of the agency
 
00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 align:start position:0%
on the next slide this is my favorite
 
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
slide relative to the Department of
 
00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
Education and our agency because in one
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
slide you can see everything that's
 
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 align:start position:0%
happening at the agency
 
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
at the top you can see the funding that
 
00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
goes into our K-12 education system and
 
00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 align:start position:0%
what some of those sources are whether
 
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
those are coming from General funds
 
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
federal funds education trust fund other
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
funds to give you a total as well
 
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
although on a delayed basis because we
 
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
don't always have that information right
 
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 align:start position:0%
away we show the local education
 
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
spending that comes through relative to
 
00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
our K-12 system we then have our
 
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
enrollment numbers our average cost per
 
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
pupil and again sort of a snapshot of
 
00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
the revenue side of uh and I'm going to
 
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
spend I can spend some more time walking
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
through this because there's a lot of
 
00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:03.539 align:start position:0%
details I get it but it is convenient
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
that you have everything in one place to
 
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
be able to see it all
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
um and then you get down uh further down
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
you see where those funds are deployed
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
how we are using those uh the first is
 
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
General funds state aid you can see over
 
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
time much of those funds have moved into
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
different places or have been phased out
 
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to work through you know
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
each of those changes but some of those
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
have happened in Prior years the two
 
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.860 align:start position:0%
items that remain in there are both are
 
00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:34.979 align:start position:0%
Statewide special education Aid at fifty
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and our career and Tech
 
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
student organizations at uh fifty
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.230 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
um

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
and principally uh you know these are
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
General funds that are used
 
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
um you know the career and text student
 
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:52.620 align:start position:0%
organizations I mean I can tell you that
 
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
I have heard from our CTE programs they
 
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
would like to see more funding uh
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
towards those programs uh principally
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
These funds are used to provide stipends
 
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
to Educators who Mentor the various
 
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
programs like our FFA or some other
 
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
program like that
 
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
um and then again moving down you get to
 
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:12.900 align:start position:0%
the next Group which is General funds
 
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
pass through state aid and the reason
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
why we designate this is because I know
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
that um we all live and die by lapse uh
 
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
in terms of how we're going to make our
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
budget and one of the things that we
 
00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
wanted to make clear is that we don't
 
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
actually get to put our our hands on
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
these funds you give them to us and we
 
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
hand them off to somebody else right
 
00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:33.419 align:start position:0%
there's no chance you're going to get a
 
00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:34.979 align:start position:0%
lap so if you're aiming at like a three
 
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
percent lapse it's not like you can
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
lapse money that you don't get to touch
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
you just you receive it and we pass it
 
00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:42.539 align:start position:0%
through and there have been some changes
 
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
in terms of movements between categories
 
00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:47.339 align:start position:0%
that we can discuss but uh you know it
 
00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
includes court order placements
 
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
scholarships for Orphans and Veterans
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
the New England Board of higher
 
00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:54.430 align:start position:0%
the New England Board of higher
education

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
the school nutrition programming parts
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
of it anyways this state assessment
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
which we'll spend some time talking
 
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.130 align:start position:0%
which we'll spend some time talking
about

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:03.140 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:08.420 align:start position:0%
CTE vocational Ed State adult education
 
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
VR field program match uh Individual
 
00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:14.300 align:start position:0%
Services this is part B for
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who are blind and a robotics
 
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.370 align:start position:0%
individuals who are blind and a robotics
program

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:22.019 align:start position:0%
um and then just you can see some of the
 
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
uh movements that have taken place but I
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
think actually I'm going to highlight
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
those when I get down to the last
 
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.910 align:start position:0%
those when I get down to the last
category

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
category
 
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
um and then the next line item is really
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
I like to say this is what we actually
 
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:35.220 align:start position:0%
have some degree of control over uh it's
 
00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
in terms of the funding that we're
 
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
spending in the agency to run the agency
 
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
it includes a salary benefits and
 
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
insurance line and a doit rent phone and
 
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
other and these are the allocations that
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
we get from Department of administrative
 
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.509 align:start position:0%
we get from Department of administrative
services

00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
and then if I continue to move down
 
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
further you can see the education trust
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
fund which includes a variety of
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
components a building Aid component
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
there was a conversation before the
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
meeting started relative to the building
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
a because the perception is that the
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
building Aid is 50 million and in fact
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
it is the other component of that sits
 
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
over in Treasury and is interest on
 
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
bonds that is being serviced so there is
 
00:10:14.329 --> 00:10:14.339 align:start position:0%
a 50 million appropriation there it's
 
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
just split between two agencies
 
00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
um uh District public school adequacy
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
which is pretty straightforward we
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
understand what that is tuition and
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
transportation is associated with our
 
00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:26.519 align:start position:0%
CTE programming the charter school
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy again adequacy for all of our
 
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:30.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire public charter schools
 
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
State Testing and assessment and we'll
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
spend a little bit of time talking about
 
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
that particular line item because we
 
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:39.860 align:start position:0%
again stuff has been moved around
 
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
kindergarten Aid which was an initial
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
startup program that's now included and
 
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
um special education Aid which is our
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
state special education funding that is
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
provided uh building lease Aid primarily
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
associated with the charter school
 
00:11:00.769 --> 00:11:00.779 align:start position:0%
leases but I think it's been opened up
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
now to no okay so just chart school this
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
Aid yep I know there was talk about
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
changing that okay education Freedom
 
00:11:08.329 --> 00:11:08.339 align:start position:0%
accounts which I'm sure will spend a lot
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
of time talking about the fa phase out
 
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
grants Public School infrastructure fund
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
um is not in there uh in in the current
 
00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:19.730 align:start position:0%
um is not in there uh in in the current
budget

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:19.740 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
ETF administrator for student
 
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
information system this is our Alma
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
program our Statewide student
 
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
information system associated with the
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
slds so we have a Federal grant that
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
helps with this as well as the state
 
00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:32.779 align:start position:0%
funding for this particular application
 
00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:36.620 align:start position:0%
it is a Statewide student information
 
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:40.140 align:start position:0%
system that we I've been advocating for
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
this one for a long time since I got to
 
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
the agency we are literally going to be
 
00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:46.940 align:start position:0%
saving districts uh man years of time
 
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
and I can explain to you the Arcane
 
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
process of getting information to the
 
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
schools and getting information from the
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
schools that is very difficult and and
 
00:11:58.810 --> 00:11:58.820 align:start position:0%
sometimes inaccurate you'll see Lottery
 
00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
revenue is funded at one dollar and
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
again this is a an accounting placement
 
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
where we're just like setting up a new
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
account and I'm happy to walk you
 
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
through that and then code order
 
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
placements I missed down below so some
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
of the the numbers that I want to walk
 
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
through is I'll start with quarter
 
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
replacement since I just finished you'll
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
see that that came out of state
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
pass-through Aid it was funded at two
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
it's historically been funded at a
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
million and a half then we increased it
 
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:28.820 align:start position:0%
to 2 million it's now at a number of
 
00:12:32.449 --> 00:12:32.459 align:start position:0%
4.516 million the way that this works is
 
00:12:35.449 --> 00:12:35.459 align:start position:0%
that under the law if a student is
 
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
placed in an educational setting by the
 
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
court that we have the authority to draw
 
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
a warrant to pay for that right because
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
anytime they place the kids
 
00:12:47.329 --> 00:12:47.339 align:start position:0%
um you know we historically have funded
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
it and uh and then we ended up going
 
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
back and asking for a warrant to fund it
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
and so each time when we submit a budget
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
we always just submit an amount that we
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be as opposed to
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
what it turns out so we estimate right
 
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:02.220 align:start position:0%
now that it'll be about 4.5 million
 
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair historically that has
 
00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
never been in the education Trust
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
um and um if in fact it
 
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
does exceed that amount it has to be by
 
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.250 align:start position:0%
does exceed that amount it has to be by
law

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:19.100 align:start position:0%
um that has to be filled
 
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
and in that it's in the education trust
 
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
you have assembled it there
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
um that in turn would draw down more
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
money from the trust what was your
 
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
rationale for taking it out of the trust
 
00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:32.690 align:start position:0%
rationale for taking it out of the trust
please

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:34.019 align:start position:0%
um I think that the governor believed
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
that the education trust fund um was the
 
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
appropriate place for this because it is
 
00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
specifically funding for the education
 
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
of these students right so it's not for
 
00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
um providing any types of other health
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
care services or mental health services
 
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
for these students who are adjudicated
 
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
these are court ordered correct these
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
are these are the these are the costs of
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
educating the court order place students
 
00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:58.139 align:start position:0%
and one other thing that's probably
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
important to note as well is while we do
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
have warrant Authority relative to court
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
ordered placements there is as well if
 
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
the if the education trust fund was
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
short there is warrant Authority in the
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
education trust I understand that thank
 
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.110 align:start position:0%
education trust I understand that thank
you

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's a move that I wanted
 
00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
to kind of flag for you so that you
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
would be able to uh to see that
 
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
um the other one that you will see is
 
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
we've also moved State assessment
 
00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:25.019 align:start position:0%
um line item down so at least a portion
 
00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:28.139 align:start position:0%
of that came down to uh the education
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
trust fund as well and I think what
 
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
you'll see in this budget is trying to
 
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
reflect in the education trust fund all
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
the costs associated with education so
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
that we make it clear what it is that
 
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
we're spending to educate the students
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire so that was
 
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
another item that was transferred out of
 
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
one into the other that one does not
 
00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
have warrant Authority
 
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
specifically as a line item
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
and let me just go through these other
 
00:14:59.090 --> 00:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
line items if anything else I want to
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
flag for you
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
um you'll see as well in adult education
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
in the general funds state pass-through
 
00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
that increased about 300 000 and that
 
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
was an increase that
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
um we were seeking associated with our
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
adult education programming and what
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
we're finding in adult education program
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
which has been a phenomena that has been
 
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
taking place over ever since I've been a
 
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
commissioner here is that you see an
 
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
increasing number of high school
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
students mostly 11 and 12th graders who
 
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
are leaving the traditional educational
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
setting and going to the adult education
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
programming to be able to get their
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
education uh last year we had 1700 11th
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
and 12th graders who left the
 
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
traditional education setting and went
 
00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:50.339 align:start position:0%
to the adult education setting to finish
 
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
their education get their High School
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
foreign thank you Mr chair
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
um devil dead has been pretty
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
consistently funded um would you be
 
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
adverse to raising that to to 5 million
 
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
per year of the biennium uh so Adult Ed
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
serves a tremendous purpose in our
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
communities I agree yeah and they do
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
agree and particularly the students
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
um that they're serving our kids who are
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
not having success and you're finding a
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
success degrees Adult Ed programs
 
00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:26.519 align:start position:0%
um so the only um so I have no problem
 
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
if if you do we're going to support and
 
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
we're going to you know serve those
 
00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.490 align:start position:0%
we're going to you know serve those
students

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
um what we have to just be careful of is
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
we don't want we want to make sure that
 
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
we keep the Right Mix because we receive
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of federal funds
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
there as well and we want to make sure
 
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
that we don't jeopardize our federal
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
funds um because we've two things can
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
happen one is we increase those funds
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
and we over serve uh the non-adult
 
00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:55.139 align:start position:0%
population and that would jeopardize our
 
00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:56.290 align:start position:0%
population and that would jeopardize our
funds

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:56.300 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:58.740 align:start position:0%
alternatively we have matches associated
 
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
with that program we want to make sure
 
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
that we don't supplant something that we
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately can't recover back in a
 
00:17:06.049 --> 00:17:06.059 align:start position:0%
federal ground so my question is would 5
 
00:17:06.059 --> 00:17:07.069 align:start position:0%
federal ground so my question is would 5
million

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
work so what I can tell you is that the
 
00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:11.459 align:start position:0%
amount that we've put in there the
 
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
additional three hundred thousand
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
dollars I think we can support I mean
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
this is going to support a whole other
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
person I think we can support that
 
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
Community I don't know that I need
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
additional funding beyond that at this
 
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
point in time so I'm making the ask and
 
00:17:27.169 --> 00:17:27.179 align:start position:0%
uh and I think I'm okay at that you know
 
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:30.059 align:start position:0%
within the context if we have the funds
 
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
we will try and deploy them as efficacy
 
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
as we possibly can
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
um so I do think that we needed more
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
money to support this population of
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
students and so I've asked for that
 
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chairman and then we'll
 
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
as well I'm gonna I'm gonna take you
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
through a bunch of other slides that
 
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
sort of explain some of this further and
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
then there might be more questions also
 
00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:54.419 align:start position:0%
well maybe maybe I'll hold off okay I
 
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
just wanted to flag for you a couple of
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
the different line items there so we can
 
00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
keep moving on if I go to my next page
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
of the presentation
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
um I just want to reconcile for everyone
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
the changes between the agency phase and
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
the governor's phase because I know
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's a question that I always get and
 
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
there you can see we talked about
 
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
assessment which was moved from the
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
general funds line item down into the
 
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
education trust fund line item we talked
 
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
about court ordered placement moving as
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
well and then in terms of we also have
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh two CTE centers as you know that we
 
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
generally are refurbishing two CTE
 
00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
centers every biennium
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
um and we had uh you know Sugar River
 
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
and winter Squam were both in the queue
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that one they were moved
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
out of the capital budget into the
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
operating budget they are education
 
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
expenses so they've moved that and then
 
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
as well when a Squam does not yet have a
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
positive vote last year they voted they
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
were close they didn't get there and so
 
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
that has not been carried forward in the
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
governor's phase of the budget because
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
it had not passed uh doesn't have a
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
warrant article it is on it is on the
 
00:18:57.289 --> 00:18:57.299 align:start position:0%
ballot this spring in March and it may
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
or may not pass but we don't know the
 
00:19:00.409 --> 00:19:00.419 align:start position:0%
answer to that
 
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
um so those are just some of the changes
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
to help reconcile for you in your own
 
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.450 align:start position:0%
to help reconcile for you in your own
minds

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
minds
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
um on the next slide I assume that there
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
would be much conversation about the
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account expansion and
 
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
so you can see the categories of
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
students that we have recommended
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
expanding and that was in the agency
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
budget and that includes a 500 percent
 
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
cap on federal poverty level that was
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
added in the governor's face of the
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
budget for these individual categories
 
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
of students
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
and then on the next slide you have our
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
prioritized need that um as you know we
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
we give our agency budget and we flag
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
our prioritized needs and so one of the
 
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
items that we had as our prioritized
 
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:44.220 align:start position:0%
need was our school security so this is
 
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
our as you know we've done a number of
 
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
different grant opportunities to schools
 
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059 align:start position:0%
to enhance uh the physical security of
 
00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
the facilities and the sites and my
 
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
perspective is that this is the kind of
 
00:19:57.049 --> 00:19:57.059 align:start position:0%
thing that we just want to fund on a
 
00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
consistent basis rather than kind of a
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
hit and a miss and be reactionary and so
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
we had recommended five million dollars
 
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
a year of just spending on continuing to
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
um you know the the best Security
 
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
Options in our schools we have uh you
 
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
know this last year we funded projects
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
as an example we received we opened up a
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
grant window last summer we had we
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
solicited you know requests from school
 
00:20:27.169 --> 00:20:27.179 align:start position:0%
districts for security measures we
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
prioritize access control because we
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
believe that that was kind of the first
 
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
level of protection that we wanted to
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
wrap around our students and our staff
 
00:20:36.409 --> 00:20:36.419 align:start position:0%
who were in these facilities we were
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
able to fund 100 of the requests for
 
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
Access security projects we have
 
00:20:45.049 --> 00:20:45.059 align:start position:0%
continued to seek other alternative
 
00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
types of funding opportunities for that
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
and we think that we have between 7 and
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars more funding through
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
some through some federal programming
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
that we can bring to these funds but
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
we'll continue to just try and find
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
funding opportunities to bring forward
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner and everybody else my
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
apologies for being a few minutes late I
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
I still need to learn how snow Works
 
00:21:07.919 --> 00:21:09.350 align:start position:0%
I still need to learn how snow Works
apparently

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:12.059 align:start position:0%
um in regards to you know Access Control
 
00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
in schools
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
obviously there is a need we have to
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
protect the facilities but I just wanted
 
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
to check if you if the department is
 
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
focusing on providing the funds for the
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
you know physical construction that is
 
00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
needed or you also spend time working on
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know training the staff or offering
 
00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
resources to train the staff because
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
having One Secured entry point in the
 
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
building doesn't do that much if there
 
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
are other uh very unsecured and wide
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
open access points uh which in my
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
experience has been the case in a lot of
 
00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
the schools that I've been looking at so
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
are we you know what are we doing
 
00:21:51.649 --> 00:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
something in regards to training and
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
operations rather than just facilities
 
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
yeah so I mean it's a it's a simple
 
00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
question but a big answer so I'll try
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
and like uh you know boil it down so the
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
the latest so we work hand and glove
 
00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
really with Homeland Security in terms
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
of making sure that we are being
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
responsive to the appropriate needs in
 
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
the buildings part of that work means
 
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
that every single school is required
 
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
hired to do a Emergency Operations plan
 
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
and a security assessment homeland
 
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
security goes into the schools and we
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
started these a number of years ago goes
 
00:22:25.789 --> 00:22:25.799 align:start position:0%
into the schools and evaluates that plan
 
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
and does a security evaluation in the
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
actual building itself
 
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
they provide recommendations to the
 
00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
schools if I go back into the 2018 time
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
frame we had funding of about 30 million
 
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
dollars and those those grants were used
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
to do both a lot of a broader array of
 
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:49.460 align:start position:0%
security mitigation measures including
 
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
vestibules and secure entrances and
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
those were done only if they were a
 
00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
mitigation that was recommended by
 
00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security in these latest Grant
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
rounds we have not funded larger capital
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
projects because what you'll find is
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
that a single vestibule can cost like
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
two million dollars if you're you know
 
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
if you have to build it so these have
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
been focused more on you know three
 
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:16.740 align:start position:0%
types of of mitigating control so access
 
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.110 align:start position:0%
types of of mitigating control so access
controls

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
controls
 
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
you know notification and emergency
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
response right so those are the kind of
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
three things so Access Control keeping
 
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
people out notification means if
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
somebody is in the building that you
 
00:23:30.649 --> 00:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
have the ability to notify so that you
 
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
can get emergency responders there and
 
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
then the emergency response is how we
 
00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
can get them more efficient in their
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
response to the thing so whenever we do
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
those programs they include a variety of
 
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
different training programs that would
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
come along with that and as well schools
 
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
themselves have the ability to do
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
training and they have in law they have
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
certain training that they're required
 
00:23:51.409 --> 00:23:51.419 align:start position:0%
to do in terms of practicing certain
 
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
emergency drills and stuff like that so
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's helpful
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
very helpful and I appreciate a
 
00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
comprehensive approach that's you know
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
taken because that's what we need in
 
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
order to really secure those buildings
 
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for the details
 
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
okay and I and I agree with you I think
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
we need a comprehensive approach and we
 
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
need a consistent approach as opposed to
 
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
a reactionary approach
 
00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:12.419 align:start position:0%
um and so that's what that initial thing
 
00:24:12.419 --> 00:24:13.610 align:start position:0%
um and so that's what that initial thing
was

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
um the next slide um another regular
 
00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
question is just like the Staffing and
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
you know what we have in our staffing
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
and so we currently have 291 employees
 
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
there are 13 new positions 7ds that have
 
00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:27.740 align:start position:0%
been requested through this process
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
generally funded so a Ed analytics
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
resources so this would be in Caitlyn's
 
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
division it is really just um you know
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure we've got good data
 
00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:39.299 align:start position:0%
relative to those students and keeping
 
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
track of where our students are and
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
where they're moving the second is in
 
00:24:45.289 --> 00:24:45.299 align:start position:0%
adult education this is that funding
 
00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
that I talked about previously which
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
would fund somebody to focus on making
 
00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
sure we're supporting those high school
 
00:24:51.649 --> 00:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
students in our adult ed programs
 
00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
depending on where the legislature goes
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
with Early Child childhood we've got two
 
00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:57.500 align:start position:0%
positions for early childhood education
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
and then we've got eight federally
 
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
funded programs one of those or five of
 
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
those are in special education and this
 
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
really revolves around a program that we
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
started about five years ago maybe
 
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
actually maybe six years ago at this
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
point in time it's called Universal
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
Design for Learning
 
00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
udl it is an approach to make sure that
 
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
our teachers are trained to meet the
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
needs of all the kids in there we have
 
00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:21.539 align:start position:0%
worked with an organization called cast
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
which was the developer of udl for a
 
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:25.700 align:start position:0%
number of years under contract
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
and that was helpful as we began to
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
build our capacity and our experience
 
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
with this stuff we now feel comfortable
 
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
enough that we can now bring that
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
activity in-house and meet the needs for
 
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
lower for a lesser cost and so
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
essentially what we're doing is we're
 
00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
just going to assimilate that activity
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
into the department for udl vocation
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation this is a Nashua position
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
that we're hiring if you might remember
 
00:25:54.169 --> 00:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
like a couple years ago I tried to phase
 
00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
out the Nashua office and integrate it
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
with some stuff and we thought that we
 
00:25:59.930 --> 00:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
would better be able to serve our
 
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
customers that way and essentially what
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
we're doing is we we kind of we shut
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
down our national office and we moved in
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
with other partners that serve the same
 
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
types of individuals what we're finding
 
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
is it's not as effective as I thought it
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
would be and so we're going to move
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
forward again and just have our separate
 
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
national office so
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
um you know we have been looking for
 
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
lease space and so this would be for an
 
00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
office manager there because we had the
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
same Personnel but we then those
 
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
Personnel were working in community
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
centers and other non-profits that were
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
serving these same folks thinking like
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
well if they have to go to the community
 
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
center to get their SNAP benefits or
 
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
this other benefit why don't we just
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
meet with them there rather than make
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
them have another stop it's not as easy
 
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
to coordinate with all of those other
 
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
organizations as we had hoped and so we
 
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
just think it's better we probably
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
continue to serve them better on our own
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
and then we have two individuals
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
relative to assessment and
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
accountability what you'll find is that
 
00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
the federal data requirements around
 
00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
assessment and accountability they just
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
keep going they keep turning the volume
 
00:26:59.149 --> 00:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
higher and higher in terms of what
 
00:27:00.409 --> 00:27:00.419 align:start position:0%
information they need what information
 
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
they want how you do that
 
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:03.590 align:start position:0%
they want how you do that
um

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
for Melissa and Nate spent decades you
 
00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
know getting complying with uh you know
 
00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
pure peer review associated with the
 
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
assessments just like a level of
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
granularity that's even difficult to
 
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.490 align:start position:0%
granularity that's even difficult to
imagine

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
um and so those so that is relative to
 
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
the assessment and the accountability
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
side of that is again the reporting
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
associated with that
 
00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
um and then one education trust fund uh
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
person as you can see the education
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
trust fund is becoming a much much more
 
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
highly complex accounting function uh
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're spending you know over a billion
 
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
dollars through there and we just think
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
it's important that you have somebody
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
who's basically like a and a fund
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
manager essentially for the billion
 
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:43.740 align:start position:0%
dollar fund not that we're not managing
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
it now but someone who's dedicated to
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
that and so that's what those positions
 
00:27:48.649 --> 00:27:48.659 align:start position:0%
are and then the last slide and then we
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
can just go back through and talk about
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
anything that we want
 
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
um is the capital budget requests and
 
00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
again I I kind of mentioned this already
 
00:27:57.769 --> 00:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
so and I only I flagged that here I
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
realize that I'm in division two and I'm
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
not at the capital committee but as you
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
know the Sugar River is now in the
 
00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
education and trust funds so that falls
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
within your domain but these were the
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
two CTE centers that were proposed in
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
the capital budget and then again Sugar
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
River is now in the um in the operation
 
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
budget in the education trust fund and
 
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of an overview of the
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
budget and now we can let's now we'll
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
get the detailed Pages sent again thank
 
00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I just want to go to the
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
positions again okay um you've got
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
currently 291. what's your breakdown
 
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.730 align:start position:0%
currently 291. what's your breakdown
Federal

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
um General
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh do I have that on that sheet I don't
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
have that broken down on my sheets so
 
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm going to say we have
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
approximately 60 65 General maybe 25
 
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
other and then the remaining is federal
 
00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
and others would be in your
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
credentialing correct yeah and what
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
you'll find is can I just can I follow
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
up on that question as well because
 
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
actually if I go back to my summary
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
sheet you'll find that we did move
 
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
um some positions around into General
 
00:29:02.769 --> 00:29:02.779 align:start position:0%
funds so for example if I go to my like
 
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet here some of the font you'll
 
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
see an increase in general funds one of
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
those increases is so I have two people
 
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
that work in federal compliance is what
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
we've called it and the difficulty with
 
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
them being 100 federally funded in
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
federal compliance is that if I have to
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
do a compliance thing associated with
 
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
State programs you know like a food
 
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
program maybe if it's a state food
 
00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:24.059 align:start position:0%
program or a CTE program or something
 
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
like that they can't work on it right
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
because they're federally funded so they
 
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:29.220 align:start position:0%
can only work on the federal programs
 
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
and so what we basically did is we moved
 
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
their positions down into the general
 
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
funds and then we're going to fill them
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
out to the federal programs and have the
 
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
federal crimes pay for them and that way
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
if I ask them to do uh you know to look
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
at something on a general fund basis
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
they we have the funding it's a
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
legitimate use of their activities so so
 
00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.169 align:start position:0%
legitimate use of their activities so so
um

00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire gets the minimum allotment
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
in its federal funds usually small state
 
00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
minimums I guess they call it in some of
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
the programs um so in special education
 
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
um I have a question that has been asked
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
of me so I will ask it of you
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
um apparently
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
um over the years we've had many more
 
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
special ed positions federally funded
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
positions in the department of Ed that
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
work primarily only with special
 
00:30:21.649 --> 00:30:21.659 align:start position:0%
education and
 
00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
um and they are paid under idea funds
 
00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
and now those positions there I guess
 
00:30:30.289 --> 00:30:30.299 align:start position:0%
there are about three or
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
three to six have not been filled and my
 
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:35.940 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.310 align:start position:0%
question is
um

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
what happens to those funds
 
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:44.220 align:start position:0%
um how are those funds used and
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
um how are you meeting the
 
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
the idea guidelines are pretty stringent
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
um you know in when you live in the
 
00:30:54.649 --> 00:30:54.659 align:start position:0%
world of of compliance
 
00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
um it takes a lot of Manpower so how are
 
00:30:59.810 --> 00:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
you meeting that and then how are you
 
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
meeting the needs of people out in the
 
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
communities because special ed is always
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
a Hot Topic it is yeah and I think and
 
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:07.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question because I
 
00:31:09.049 --> 00:31:09.059 align:start position:0%
think it's a good one
 
00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
um I what is the number of open
 
00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.409 align:start position:0%
um I what is the number of open
positions

00:31:14.409 --> 00:31:14.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
and it's not because we don't want to
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
find them we just can't find him he
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
hired them yes exactly so what's going
 
00:31:21.649 --> 00:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
on is that we have a very high vacancy
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
rate in special education right now I
 
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
mean like the schools who are having
 
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
difficulty finding special education
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
folks in the schools we too are having
 
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.570 align:start position:0%
folks in the schools we too are having
difficulty

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
difficulty
 
00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:30.899 align:start position:0%
um and they get to pay more than we do
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
as well so generally when we compete
 
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
with them they're able to recruit those
 
00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:36.779 align:start position:0%
people more quickly how we're doing it
 
00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:39.179 align:start position:0%
is you know we're basically you know
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
people are working harder so we've got
 
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
overtime in the division uh and in the
 
00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.450 align:start position:0%
overtime in the division uh and in the
bureau

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
00:31:45.769 --> 00:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
um and then we're just trying to be
 
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
smart in terms of deploying our
 
00:31:48.889 --> 00:31:48.899 align:start position:0%
resources to that most at-risk places so
 
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
if we're doing a monitoring or something
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
like that we're trying to prioritize
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
okay if I can't monitor 10 I can only
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
monitor eight like where am I going to
 
00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
go at that point in time so that's
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
pretty much how we're doing it but there
 
00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
is no we if I had my druthers like so
 
00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:03.299 align:start position:0%
these are not positions that we're
 
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
leaving vacant because it's federal
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
funds right right
 
00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
um so we're happy to go ahead and hire
 
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
those positions that we can find them if
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
we can't find them then generally what
 
00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
we'll do is we may do like a one-year
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
contract for somebody and say like okay
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
so you go do this for us or
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
um any any way we can to just trying to
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
keep up with Mission all right thank you
 
00:32:24.169 --> 00:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just a quick question
 
00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
if she has anybody for us to send him
 
00:32:27.769 --> 00:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
our way okay
 
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's a quick follow-up right whenever
 
00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
you say difficulty finding qualified
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
people usually there are many reasons
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
for that one of the ones that was talked
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
about a lot during this budget process
 
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
is uh you know licensing and is is this
 
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
a place obviously we still have issues
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
with just availability of Workforce with
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
you know training and paying all that
 
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
but just talking about licensing for a
 
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
moment is there anything in this
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
particular proposal that would make it a
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
bit easier to maybe accept licenses from
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
other states from people that are
 
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:00.059 align:start position:0%
qualified so we have an easier time
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
recruiting or is it you know not
 
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
necessarily covered in this one yeah so
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't affect us because we don't
 
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
have a licensing requirement for the
 
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
individuals that we hire we basically
 
00:33:12.289 --> 00:33:12.299 align:start position:0%
are trying to hire people who have the
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
skill set that we need in the agency and
 
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
so we're not limited by whether they're
 
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
licensed or not we're limited because
 
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
there's not enough people who have the
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
experience working in the special
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
education domain for that
 
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
thank you and it's not as much a
 
00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:30.539 align:start position:0%
follow-up as a leftover question from an
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
earlier Point
 
00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
um you were saying that you are gonna
 
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
move to people from being funded
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
federally to the general fund for the
 
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
ability to deploy them either for
 
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
federal work and then you'll deal back
 
00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.490 align:start position:0%
federal work and then you'll deal back
yeah

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
would it be okay to ask for a report you
 
00:33:48.049 --> 00:33:48.059 align:start position:0%
know two years from now when we are back
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
here on uh what percentage of that was
 
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
actually charged back to the federal uh
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
funds based on you know how they were
 
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
used just to have a better understanding
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
because right now if I would ask you
 
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the time you know it
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
would be hard to tell but just to give
 
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
us data so we understand you know
 
00:34:06.769 --> 00:34:06.779 align:start position:0%
because we're putting two people on
 
00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:08.339 align:start position:0%
general fund but we're expecting a
 
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
revenue right they're going to get
 
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
pulled back out exactly and I'm just
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what's the best way
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
for us to forecast the net impact going
 
00:34:18.169 --> 00:34:18.179 align:start position:0%
forward yeah so that's an easy thing for
 
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
us to do because what we basically do we
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
have a process and on a quarterly basis
 
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
we have like a Time collection system
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
where we're billing out to those
 
00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:26.099 align:start position:0%
programs so you don't have to wait two
 
00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:27.899 align:start position:0%
years the next time we close the books
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
we could show you who got billed out and
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
where they got billed out too it would
 
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
be appreciated if it would be included
 
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
just because again we need to understand
 
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
what the burden to the general fund is
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
um at its Inception the education trust
 
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
fund was strictly to to pay for adequacy
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
and we always managed to adjust it so
 
00:34:54.169 --> 00:34:54.179 align:start position:0%
that it was just a little bit less than
 
00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
adequacy and then we filled it up with
 
00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
general fund because we felt if we went
 
00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.210 align:start position:0%
general fund because we felt if we went
over

00:34:59.210 --> 00:34:59.220 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
the money would be lost
 
00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.570 align:start position:0%
the money would be lost
so

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.310 align:start position:0%
so
now

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
obviously the education trust fund with
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
the reduction in student enrollment is
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
producing more than that one of the ways
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
is we can put a lot of more stuff in the
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
education trust fund or we could take
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
the law that puts parts of the various
 
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
taxes and reduce the amount going which
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
is my preference because
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
I don't want to put money in education
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
trust fund that goes through a lapse
 
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
that we really needed somewhere else
 
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
so that's that's my Approach was would
 
00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
be try to reduce the fractions of the
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
other taxes that are going to the
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
education trust fund since the need is
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
less yes so certainly an option right
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
you got debits and you got credit so you
 
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
can either like if you have too many
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
credits you can put more debits in there
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
if you you know if you don't put more
 
00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
debits in there you can reduce the
 
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
number of credits that go in which would
 
00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
be the revenue side of that so either
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
way it balances out the trust fund I
 
00:35:58.849 --> 00:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
think what we want to do is the two
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
aspects we want to try and focus on is
 
00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
we want you know to have a long-term
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
perspective relative to the education
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
trust fund and make sure that to your
 
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
point we're trying to balance it on
 
00:36:10.849 --> 00:36:10.859 align:start position:0%
parity we're not trying to create a
 
00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
large Surplus balance there now we're
 
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what are the
 
00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
associated costs of running this thing
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
and that's the revenue that we should
 
00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
put in there and I think that that's an
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate philosophy and thank you you
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
already gave me a copy of this okay
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
somebody else then okay
 
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
so it's a good read then is what you're
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
saying yes
 
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.210 align:start position:0%
saying yes
um

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
this is a very good visual okay what's
 
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
been going on for the last few years
 
00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
that's was my favorite one right and we
 
00:36:37.609 --> 00:36:37.619 align:start position:0%
have it for years before that but it
 
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
gets too small and then you can't read
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
it so if you want or the more years we
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
have them but it's fairly obvious that
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
things are marching down into the
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
educational cross fund over time
 
00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
what about any of the general fund
 
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
salary and benefit moving into education
 
00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
RSA or is it just by practice it's not
 
00:36:59.930 --> 00:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not restricted it's where
 
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
you want to fund it I mean we all are
 
00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
working on educational activities so
 
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
um it's a little bit more to
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler's question is like
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
you know how do you balance the debits
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
and the credits is really what you're
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
after so well do you want to comment do
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
you have a thought on that I heard you
 
00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
large flow through programs
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
are these large military programs that
 
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
are going specifically to school
 
00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
districts to can't the department you
 
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
would never see last one maybe from the
 
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Education on those types
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
of programs there's little to no
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility on how those funding
 
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
resources are distributed things like
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
building a pretty prescriptive and law
 
00:37:43.609 --> 00:37:43.619 align:start position:0%
adequacy obviously extremely
 
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
prescriptive and specifically a law and
 
00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
so those kind of are the programs that
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
have which is marked down to the
 
00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
education trust funded over the years
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
whereas the more General operational
 
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
type expenses have always continued to
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
remain in general fund and again I don't
 
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
know for sure what the to your point
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
like there's this March down to the
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and I'm not sure if
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
that is uh you know to representative
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
Wilder's position well there is funding
 
00:38:10.849 --> 00:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
there therefore the debits are attracted
 
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
to it as opposed to reducing the credits
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
and let them get paid for someplace else
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
yes I recall at one time you had
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
positions that were 50 Federal 50 state
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
or 75 20. still do yeah you still do
 
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
okay because I was curious when you said
 
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
person working on this couldn't work on
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
because so we do yeah so we already had
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
some that we have balanced out but then
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
what was happening is our federal
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
compliance we saw like a lot of state
 
00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
laws that are being passed that you guys
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
are wanting us to can you go look at
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
this you know is the school doing this
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
or did they file their doe 25 you know
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
on the state finances or something like
 
00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
that and we're like well we don't I mean
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
if Caitlin or Idaho doesn't do it we
 
00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:50.220 align:start position:0%
don't have anybody who's funded in a way
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
that we could say like yes you know
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
Lindsay who is our compliance person can
 
00:38:56.329 --> 00:38:56.339 align:start position:0%
you go look at x and y z school district
 
00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
and see what's going on and why they're
 
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
late on their doe 25 as an example
 
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
responsibility to change
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
so well I mean if we move them into the
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
general funds then we have the ability
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
to to build to to further to do that
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so they would just do
 
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
proportionally so we uh so we basically
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
are doing time collection we have time
 
00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:16.140 align:start position:0%
sheets that people are submitting it's
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
almost like a like an accounting firm or
 
00:39:20.329 --> 00:39:20.339 align:start position:0%
a law firm Caitlyn and I are familiar
 
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
with accounting firms in our background
 
00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.490 align:start position:0%
with accounting firms in our background
but

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
um so you just do time time claiming
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
against it and that's where that goes
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
and so essentially what we do is we do
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
estimates as to where people think
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to be spending their time
 
00:39:32.089 --> 00:39:32.099 align:start position:0%
on a quarterly you know so they look
 
00:39:32.099 --> 00:39:33.410 align:start position:0%
on a quarterly you know so they look
forward

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
um and then that time is you know at the
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
end of that quarter then you reconcile
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
what did you actually spend your time on
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
do we have the right allocations
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
um that's how we do it
 
00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
I mean into you know going back a step
 
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
further and it's probably more detail
 
00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:46.740 align:start position:0%
than you're interested in but to your
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
point representative Heath about
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
minimally funded States so you have some
 
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
of these programs you know take like a
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
migrant program that'd get them to pick
 
00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
on right where they they give us so
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
little money that they don't even give
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
you enough money for somebody to
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
allocate 15 minutes of their time for
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
the program maybe and you're just like
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
how are we supposed to administer this
 
00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:05.579 align:start position:0%
Federal ground when we can't do it right
 
00:40:05.579 --> 00:40:08.329 align:start position:0%
Federal ground when we can't do it right
so

00:40:08.329 --> 00:40:08.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
I guess my question
 
00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
followed on the idea of if you bring
 
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:15.180 align:start position:0%
less money in it'll stay in the general
 
00:40:16.609 --> 00:40:16.619 align:start position:0%
fund but if you take some of your
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
general funds and put it in the
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
educational to us it's doing the same
 
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.690 align:start position:0%
educational to us it's doing the same
thing

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
it's it's making more General funds
 
00:40:25.849 --> 00:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
available somewhere else I mean it's
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
deficit credits have to balance that's
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
essentially what we're talking about
 
00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:31.859 align:start position:0%
here yes and that's really I think a
 
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
philosophy that the legislature has to
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
decide what is the approach we want to
 
00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
take right question
 
00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you uh maybe it's more of a
 
00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
comment um the education Trust
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
in it originally I remember going way
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
back when it was initiated really it was
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
to provide adequacy funding to school
 
00:40:52.079 --> 00:40:53.510 align:start position:0%
to provide adequacy funding to school
districts

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
um now all of a sudden it seems to be
 
00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.099 align:start position:0%
because it has a surplus it never had a
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
surplus before usually it had to take
 
00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
funds from the general fund to come into
 
00:41:05.569 --> 00:41:05.579 align:start position:0%
the education trust
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
um I just would hate to see it swayed
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
from its general purpose
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
um by Statute many many years ago I
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
think that funding public education I
 
00:41:19.089 --> 00:41:19.099 align:start position:0%
have to say that having the education
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts in the education trust
 
00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
bothers me greatly but that's my my
 
00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:25.609 align:start position:0%
bothers me greatly but that's my my
opinion

00:41:25.609 --> 00:41:25.619 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
the intent was as we spent many hours
 
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
talking about getting more funds to
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
public schools and so I would I would
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
really like to keep it targeted to
 
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
public schools so I think as you do that
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
I think the systemic thing that you want
 
00:41:47.329 --> 00:41:47.339 align:start position:0%
to consider is
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
um you know when it was originally set
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
up you had a revenue Source right so we
 
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
had these various Revenue sources that
 
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
we put in there those have been growing
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
over the years indeed and but over that
 
00:41:58.849 --> 00:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
same period of time we've had fewer
 
00:42:02.329 --> 00:42:02.339 align:start position:0%
students so we have less students in the
 
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
education system so essentially these
 
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
these two it's unlikely that those two
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
are going to begin to converge again and
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
so they're going to continue to pull
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
apart so we just have to decide what is
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
the philosophy that we want to have I
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
agree thank you could I ask one more
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
question while I'm here
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
um I had a question
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
um about in your your department you're
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
asking for one more position and what
 
00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
was that position going to do
 
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
so which tell me which position in your
 
00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
Commissioner's Office you are asking for
 
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
an additional position
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
just I just wanted to know what it was
 
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
what that was the purpose yeah I'm not
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
sure what page you're on was that the
 
00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.230 align:start position:0%
sure what page you're on was that the
analyst

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
analyst
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
division are you
 
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
looking I was looking at the budget and
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
um in the budget on page 1103
 
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
um in your in your office of the
 
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
commissioner you have
 
00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.609 align:start position:0%
commissioner you have
um

00:42:58.609 --> 00:42:58.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
the number of positions
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
um you have
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
um an increase from four to five four to
 
00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.770 align:start position:0%
um an increase from four to five four to
five

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:10.510 align:start position:0%
five
yes

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
where was she before she was we had her
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
last year she's had her for several
 
00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.130 align:start position:0%
last year she's had her for several
years

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer is that it
 
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:19.980 align:start position:0%
uh it might have been a movement we
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
haven't added anybody to the
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioner's Office the only thing we
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
were either thinking well you're asking
 
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
for it
 
00:43:26.329 --> 00:43:26.339 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm trying to remember where that
 
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:28.380 align:start position:0%
came okay all right let me know the
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
answer is that okay commissioner yes
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
fair enough fair enough not good well it
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
may also be
 
00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:35.870 align:start position:0%
may also be
um

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
you know in the governor's
 
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation he's recommended an
 
00:43:40.849 --> 00:43:40.859 align:start position:0%
additional computer science person and
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
it could be that that is what that
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
Edition was okay which is why because
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
what I can tell you is I don't know of
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
anybody that we're adding to the
 
00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:50.660 align:start position:0%
Commissioner's Office
 
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
can I continue
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
um now I also noticed I believe and I
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
did not know and I say congratulations
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
to you because I hear that you have now
 
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
um assumed the ownership of not you
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
personally but the state has taken over
 
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
grandest State the old Grand estate
 
00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
college to be the Department of
 
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
Education well so we right now are
 
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
basically lessor or lessee yeah from the
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
University system of New Hampshire so
 
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
just kind of full context uh you know at
 
00:44:20.589 --> 00:44:20.599 align:start position:0%
the University system of New Hampshire
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
we Consolidated uh Granite State College
 
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
into UNH and so they no longer needed
 
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
that space simultaneously our building
 
00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
was uh deemed uninhabitable I get it uh
 
00:44:34.849 --> 00:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
but you knew that right yes exactly you
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
have you been there yeah and so it just
 
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
was convenient that we were able to move
 
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
over there
 
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
um and so uh working with the Department
 
00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:43.940 align:start position:0%
of administrative Services
 
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
it made sense for us to put in a capital
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
budget request which we did to acquire
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
25 Hall Street
 
00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
um and move in there as a permanent
 
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
location that has not happened that
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
would be up to the legislature whether
 
00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
or not they want to acquire that
 
00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
facility or not if they don't we will
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
either continue to lease it or we will
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
once again become Nomads and um and to
 
00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
do our job which is fine and I will say
 
00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:11.220 align:start position:0%
that it is a convenient space
 
00:45:13.609 --> 00:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
relative to its location on the highway
 
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
and one of the facts that many people
 
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
don't know about the Department of
 
00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:18.839 align:start position:0%
Education is we do have quite a number
 
00:45:18.839 --> 00:45:19.550 align:start position:0%
Education is we do have quite a number
of

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.089 align:start position:0%
of
um

00:45:20.089 --> 00:45:20.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh you know outside people come in we
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
have like over 7 000 unique visitors a
 
00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
year that come to our department
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
um it allows us so it allows us to both
 
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
make it easy access for them as opposed
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
to driving around the office Park and
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
trying to find us
 
00:45:35.569 --> 00:45:35.579 align:start position:0%
um it also
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
um has some spaces so that we don't have
 
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
to go outside and find spaces so for
 
00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:41.339 align:start position:0%
example yesterday we I don't know how
 
00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
anybody come to the presentation
 
00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
yesterday so we did a presentation
 
00:45:47.569 --> 00:45:47.579 align:start position:0%
yesterday for legislators and about
 
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
school funding so we're able to do that
 
00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
we're able to do uh programming that we
 
00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:52.740 align:start position:0%
would do for educators that normally
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
might happen outside and we'd have to
 
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
find a facility we're able to do it in
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
that facility so
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
um we're happy with the facility but um
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of where we are is that
 
00:46:02.569 --> 00:46:02.579 align:start position:0%
does that answer your questions probably
 
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
more information than you need it but
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
it's the best perfectly and one final
 
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.829 align:start position:0%
it's the best perfectly and one final
question

00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:46:11.329 --> 00:46:11.339 align:start position:0%
um in this document I saw that the um
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
um survey the um youth risks yrbs yes is
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
not funded
 
00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.309 align:start position:0%
not funded
uh

00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
there was a governor who's that the
 
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.230 align:start position:0%
there was a governor who's that the
governors

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
perfect because if you recall the way
 
00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
that worked it's like we got the money
 
00:46:35.569 --> 00:46:35.579 align:start position:0%
but they did the work and we're like
 
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
well we didn't need to launder the money
 
00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
for them we just like send it directly
 
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
we have a long spell with no building a
 
00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
because obviously the schools were
 
00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
downsizing nobody needed to build a new
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
school because of increased students
 
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
but then we have in this Spate of people
 
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
that want to
 
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
build no schools anyway
 
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:04.140 align:start position:0%
but the thing that troubles me like
 
00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
recently here in Concord we heard from
 
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
the superintendent they gave away to
 
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
schools sold the third for who knows
 
00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:12.650 align:start position:0%
schools sold the third for who knows
what

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
and then come and ask us for hundreds of
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
thousands to build a new hundreds of
 
00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
millions right to build a new school
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
to me you just gave away millions of
 
00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
dollars of taxpayers funded buildings
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
that should have been sold and that
 
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
money should have been used for any
 
00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
building any new school don't come to us
 
00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
after you give away building buildings
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
and say oh by the way we need a new one
 
00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
that should be removed from eligibility
 
00:47:41.569 --> 00:47:41.579 align:start position:0%
if you're not fully utilizing all the at
 
00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
all the assets that you have in your own
 
00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
School District
 
00:47:47.089 --> 00:47:47.099 align:start position:0%
we're going to Discount that when you
 
00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
ask for more money another one I heard
 
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
of was
 
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:52.740 align:start position:0%
a school went up for bids the only
 
00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
bidder was a charter school we're not
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
going to sell to them you should be
 
00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
removed if you're doing that kind of
 
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
thing if you're not selling it for the
 
00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
best bid and you're not refused to sell
 
00:48:05.569 --> 00:48:05.579 align:start position:0%
it to a charter school or you're giving
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
away buildings
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
you are ineligible in my mind we should
 
00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
change that criteria I don't know who I
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
have to get to because yep so that
 
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
criteria is in law
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
um so there's the statute is 198. 188 15
 
00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
right and so there's a criteria for how
 
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
we evaluate them so if you were to add
 
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
that criteria in then that's where we
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
would add it to the checklist there are
 
00:48:34.329 --> 00:48:34.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
oh sorry sorry
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
um so well so two things one Amy is here
 
00:48:41.089 --> 00:48:41.099 align:start position:0%
and we'll be talking about building Aid
 
00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
shortly and getting into some of the
 
00:48:44.329 --> 00:48:44.339 align:start position:0%
more of the details but I just a
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
reminder there are caps on the building
 
00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
a program right now for projects that we
 
00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
funded in the past so if we have funded
 
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
a school on the last I believe it's 35
 
00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:55.140 align:start position:0%
years you are ineligible for additional
 
00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
funding relative to that school so there
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
are some limitations in the current law
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
and aim you can go over those in detail
 
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
and I think there's a limitation as well
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
like if you if we fund a project and you
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
abandon that project and you see
 
00:49:08.329 --> 00:49:08.339 align:start position:0%
theoretically can be asked for that
 
00:49:10.849 --> 00:49:10.859 align:start position:0%
funding back very good thank you
 
00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:12.839 align:start position:0%
but can I just relative to the school
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
building funding though and I know that
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
um you know again Amy's going to be up
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
here talking about it but what we want
 
00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
to do is just like we talked about the
 
00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
education trust fund having kind of this
 
00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
Divergence the revenue is going up and
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
the number of students are going down
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
when we think about the school funding
 
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
in buildings we want to build with a
 
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
long-term perspective right we have to
 
00:49:31.609 --> 00:49:31.619 align:start position:0%
meet the short-term need but we have to
 
00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
understand what the long-term
 
00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
perspective is relative to the the
 
00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
facility needs are going to be you know
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.809 --> 00:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
okay so well we're set if you have
 
00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
questions and then we've basically got
 
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
two other presentations that we wanted
 
00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
to do one is relative to school building
 
00:49:55.849 --> 00:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
Aid and I think Amy is prepared to come
 
00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
up and talk to that
 
00:49:58.370 --> 00:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
um and then we were going to do an
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
entire time on adequacy by Mark and
 
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
Caitlin uh you know so that you could
 
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
dig in and go through that as well okay
 
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
I think we have one more question two
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
more questions okay
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:50:12.119 --> 00:50:12.829 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
getting back to court order placements I
 
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
see it went up from 2 million to 4.5 yep
 
00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:21.349 align:start position:0%
see it went up from 2 million to 4.5 yep
and

00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
why why why why why such an increase so
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
here's what's going on there so
 
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
typically so 4.5 is closer to the amount
 
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:29.700 align:start position:0%
that we typically spend but because
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
we're able to draw a warrant and I think
 
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
what happens sometimes in the budget
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
process is uh it's easier to write 2
 
00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:38.579 align:start position:0%
million and then I just have to draw the
 
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
warrant later so it's not in the budget
 
00:50:41.569 --> 00:50:41.579 align:start position:0%
and so we're just putting in the budget
 
00:50:43.069 --> 00:50:43.079 align:start position:0%
we did this last time too we just put in
 
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
a budget well we think it's actually
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
going to be and then you all set a
 
00:50:47.569 --> 00:50:47.579 align:start position:0%
number for us and then we just pay out
 
00:50:49.329 --> 00:50:49.339 align:start position:0%
what it's going to be
 
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
yeah it's based on the actual
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
expenditures right yeah yeah thank you
 
00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:58.140 align:start position:0%
uh also does YDC have any effect closing
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
of YDC there's a heading effect or is it
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
is that going to increase because of the
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
closing of YDC no I don't think that
 
00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
that would affect it I mean we've been
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
working closely with YDC relative to the
 
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
education program that's going on in
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
there now and when those kids come out
 
00:51:14.329 --> 00:51:14.339 align:start position:0%
they're already court ordered that is
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
their placements right
 
00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:19.619 align:start position:0%
pretty good uh additional question here
 
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
um adult education finishers
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
that are not adults yeah how many how
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
many would you figure roughly uh about
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
1700 students 1700 so I often tease
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
Sarah Wheeler who runs that program that
 
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
she runs the largest High School in New
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because that's principally
 
00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
just 11th and 12th graders right so
 
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:41.220 align:start position:0%
she's not got uh you know necessary
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
generally you don't she's not going to
 
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
see freshmen and uh sophomores in those
 
00:51:46.609 --> 00:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
programs so that's a form of school
 
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
choice right I mean really uh sometimes
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
it's not even a choice sometimes there's
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
a source like some districts and I think
 
00:51:55.609 --> 00:51:55.619 align:start position:0%
uh representative Heath can attest to
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
this at some schools are saying to kids
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
like we don't really need you around
 
00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
here like wouldn't it be better if you
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
go over here but we're just happy to
 
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
serve them
 
00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.250 align:start position:0%
serve them
right

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner I just um was noticing
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps I missed it um did you skip a
 
00:52:17.809 --> 00:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
slide in regards to the EFA account
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
expansion no so did you speak about it
 
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
briefly I just I did speak about it
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
briefly and I assume that if you all had
 
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
questions that you'd be asking me a
 
00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
question so if you have questions please
 
00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:33.660 align:start position:0%
that it's a large item on the budgetary
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
outline that you just presented I think
 
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
a little bit further explanation would
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
be appropriate given the amount of money
 
00:52:41.089 --> 00:52:41.099 align:start position:0%
that's being allocated to it yeah so
 
00:52:43.549 --> 00:52:43.559 align:start position:0%
this is a tremendously successful
 
00:52:46.609 --> 00:52:46.619 align:start position:0%
program with a high demand for the
 
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
program we are continuing and
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
recommending expansion of that program
 
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
to further subgroups of individuals that
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
are outlined on the slide in there that
 
00:52:58.609 --> 00:52:58.619 align:start position:0%
include foster care students migratory
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
homeless child and youth students with a
 
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
parent in the armed forces some of our
 
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
English language Learners persistently
 
00:53:08.089 --> 00:53:08.099 align:start position:0%
bullied students children with a
 
00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
disability students within educational
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
hardships students in a geographic
 
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
boundary with Comprehensive support and
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
Improvement school which are low
 
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
performing Schools students in the
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
geographic jurisdiction of a school
 
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
which has been designated persistently
 
00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
dangerous and a student eligible for
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price meals so in
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
addition to the increasing demand just
 
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:29.220 align:start position:0%
for students who are already
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
participating in that program or wanting
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
to come into that program because of the
 
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
current eligibility we've also expanded
 
00:53:43.609 --> 00:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:46.380 align:start position:0%
so basically you're saying everyone
 
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
I I hope not does this include everyone
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
well one way or another you could
 
00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:53.339 align:start position:0%
probably get everybody into that
 
00:53:55.609 --> 00:53:55.619 align:start position:0%
category somehow but let me ask you a
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
question okay I am a product of Catholic
 
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
Education I went to uh Mount St Mary day
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
school I went to St Joe's High School
 
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
for Girls
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
um went on to
 
00:54:09.049 --> 00:54:09.059 align:start position:0%
um a sectarian College
 
00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:12.660 align:start position:0%
um and also public college but um
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
my parents paid
 
00:54:17.809 --> 00:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
they always paid and they could very
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
well pay
 
00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:20.329 align:start position:0%
well pay
um

00:54:20.329 --> 00:54:20.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:22.140 align:start position:0%
I struggle
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
with the fact that our public schools
 
00:54:27.049 --> 00:54:27.059 align:start position:0%
are not funded to the extent to which
 
00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
they are funded and with the extent to
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
which you are opening up education
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts basically
 
00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
we know already that many and I think I
 
00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
I think 80 percent of the people
 
00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:44.220 align:start position:0%
currently taking an education Freedom
 
00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
account already are in securing schools
 
00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
or some kind of a private school you're
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
basically opening up
 
00:54:53.650 --> 00:54:53.660 align:start position:0%
to the state of New Hampshire
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
the option of of an education of Freedom
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
account to just about everyone because
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
um any child in a public school that
 
00:55:05.569 --> 00:55:05.579 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of categories that
 
00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
you've identified and then there are a
 
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
lot of kids for any number of reasons
 
00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
could feel bullied or could be feeling
 
00:55:13.849 --> 00:55:13.859 align:start position:0%
at risk
 
00:55:16.609 --> 00:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
um so that's a pretty broad category so
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
help me to understand commissioner
 
00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
please because I really am having a
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
problem okay I can help you with that so
 
00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
just to be clear these are not uh
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
capricious titles that we've put in here
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
a student who is persistently bullied is
 
00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
someone who is defined in
 
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
rsa193-ft F colon 3. so it's the
 
00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
legislature who has created these
 
00:55:37.849 --> 00:55:37.859 align:start position:0%
categories of students we're not
 
00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
capriciously making those up but
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
certainly we know that a student who is
 
00:55:44.089 --> 00:55:44.099 align:start position:0%
consistently bullied is going to have a
 
00:55:46.849 --> 00:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
very difficult time ask accessing their
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
education and in fact you know because
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
you've worked at the agency and when we
 
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
see it we know that these kids are not
 
00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
not doing well when they are
 
00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
persistently bullied in a setting and so
 
00:55:58.490 --> 00:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not making up new
 
00:56:00.349 --> 00:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
definitions we're basically living with
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
and using the definitions that have
 
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
already been developed by the
 
00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
legislature in these various categories
 
00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
um the next point that I would make for
 
00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
you is relative to and it's I'll make a
 
00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
broader point and then I'm going to kind
 
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
of narrow it down a little bit but
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
um you know across the country there are
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
over 34 states that are introducing
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
choice programming into their states
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
um because the the parents the customers
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
so to speak are saying we want these
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
options for our children and they don't
 
00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
want these options just again
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
capriciously but because they're trying
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
to find an educational pathway that
 
00:56:41.569 --> 00:56:41.579 align:start position:0%
would be successful just let me finish
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
and then I'm sure you have some some
 
00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
further questions and that would be
 
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
great you're trying to find an
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
educational pathway that would be
 
00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:50.220 align:start position:0%
successful one of the things that I have
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
been working tenaciously on
 
00:56:58.690 --> 00:56:58.700 align:start position:0%
is to to try and help our Public Schools
 
00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
recognize that they can be that choice
 
00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
right in other words the fact that uh
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know it's a public school it too can
 
00:57:10.849 --> 00:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
be the school
 
00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
that people choose and they want to go
 
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
to and in fact even in this program we
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
have students who have left their
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
resident district and chosen another
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
Resident District another District not
 
00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:22.380 align:start position:0%
the residential because that's where
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
they want to go to school and so what
 
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to encourage more and more
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
and we've provided you know funding
 
00:57:32.089 --> 00:57:32.099 align:start position:0%
we've provided Innovation grants to
 
00:57:34.490 --> 00:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
schools to try and help the public
 
00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:37.140 align:start position:0%
schools themselves embrace the idea of
 
00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:40.140 align:start position:0%
choice and not say like well because I'm
 
00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
a school everybody's required to go here
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
unless they pay for their education
 
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes twice by paying their local
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
taxes as well as the tuition to the
 
00:57:51.049 --> 00:57:51.059 align:start position:0%
school so I don't like I don't I don't
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
see it as in either or I see the the
 
00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
public schools having an option to be
 
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
the choice for the families and then I I
 
00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
guess the last well I mean and so that's
 
00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:05.579 align:start position:0%
what I would say is that it doesn't have
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
to be an either or it has to be a both
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
and we need our public schools to be
 
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
those choices and I can speak to I mean
 
00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
just even in the last month I've met
 
00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:16.140 align:start position:0%
with two superintendents and some some
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
choice programming and say like can we
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
bring these Choice programs to your
 
00:58:22.609 --> 00:58:22.619 align:start position:0%
District to your school and and one of
 
00:58:26.329 --> 00:58:26.339 align:start position:0%
the districts they've had families leave
 
00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:29.220 align:start position:0%
to go to Choice programs and but we from
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
the very beginning were working with the
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
school saying why don't you just do this
 
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
this same district has had teachers
 
00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:37.140 align:start position:0%
leave to start Choice programs and I
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
said like well why don't you just let
 
00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:40.140 align:start position:0%
that teacher do it in your program right
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in our rules that would
 
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
prevent them from doing this and what
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
you're finding is I mean as an example
 
00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
of some of these learning pod
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
opportunities across the country you
 
00:58:49.849 --> 00:58:49.859 align:start position:0%
know these learning products teachers
 
00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
are leaving the profession and they're
 
00:58:52.849 --> 00:58:52.859 align:start position:0%
starting learning products and I'm
 
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
saying why don't you guys just work with
 
00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
the teachers start the learning part
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
right in your district and so those are
 
00:58:58.730 --> 00:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
the conversations that I'm having with
 
00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:01.140 align:start position:0%
superintendents so that they can become
 
00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.849 --> 00:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
public education was founded for the
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
common good
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:20.990 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.809 align:start position:0%
the
schools

00:59:23.809 --> 00:59:23.819 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:32.220 align:start position:0%
what my concern is we are using public
 
00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:33.530 align:start position:0%
what my concern is we are using public
funds

00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:35.030 align:start position:0%
funds
to

00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
provide programming to students
 
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
attending any variety of sectarian or
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
other libertarian or
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
such schools
 
00:59:52.849 --> 00:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
and I just find that New Hampshire right
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
now is blessed we are blessed to have an
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
extraordinary Surplus an extraordinary
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
amount of money I mean in your budget
 
01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
you're asking for a very large amount of
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
money for the education Freedom accounts
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
when I know we have been fortunate to
 
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:14.220 align:start position:0%
have these funds first of all to be even
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
able to have this conversation and quite
 
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:19.140 align:start position:0%
frankly commissioner if I had had your
 
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
budget I would have been in tears for
 
01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:26.099 align:start position:0%
Joy because believe me if we had 230 000
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
each year in the biennium for public
 
01:00:32.089 --> 01:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
school Improvement it was a lot of money
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
and you know we we struggled
 
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
um and now we're kind of flush with cash
 
01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
um in many areas we've never had a
 
01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
conversation about taking
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
um building construction
 
01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:49.799 align:start position:0%
um out of the education trust because it
 
01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
was never even a possibility
 
01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
so I just I feel like
 
01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
with and we also this time we have the
 
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
covid money that came to schools so we
 
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
did have some extensive funding through
 
01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
that but it just it troubles me so
 
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
greatly that this amount of money is
 
01:01:14.569 --> 01:01:14.579 align:start position:0%
being set aside for this purpose when
 
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
there are so many
 
01:01:20.809 --> 01:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
children that are in our public schools
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
that need so much and well anyway I can
 
01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
go on forever but I I've had my say
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
Thank you Mr chair so so I'm happy to
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
respond to that
 
01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.150 align:start position:0%
respond to that
um

01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
you know so second we're going to have a
 
01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
conversation about the education uh
 
01:01:38.089 --> 01:01:38.099 align:start position:0%
advocacy formula and I know that
 
01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:39.299 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn's going to lead that and so
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
um it's not that we've left anybody out
 
01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:45.299 align:start position:0%
in this process but the other thing I
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
would just
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
reflect on is you mentioned that you
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
know public education is about a common
 
01:01:54.349 --> 01:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
good but the good is an educated
 
01:01:54.359 --> 01:01:55.970 align:start position:0%
good but the good is an educated
citizenry

01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:55.980 align:start position:0%
citizenry
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
and what we know is that the
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all education model
 
01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect a common good because it
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
leaves too many of our children behind
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
and so the good is not that they get to
 
01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:11.940 align:start position:0%
go to a particular building or not the
 
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
good is that they're educated what we
 
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
all share as a uh you know as a state
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
and as a constitute of Republic is
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
we all benefit when our children are
 
01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
educated well and so I think that's
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
really the objective of all of this
 
01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
programming I think you know
 
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative Heath that I love
 
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
children incredibly and I want to do
 
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
everything that I can to make sure that
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
the children of New Hampshire every
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
single child has the best possible
 
01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:39.900 align:start position:0%
opportunity for success and a bright
 
01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.809 align:start position:0%
opportunity for success and a bright
future

01:02:41.809 --> 01:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:43.740 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner we will just
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
always agree to disagree okay
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
commissioner again
 
01:02:52.849 --> 01:02:52.859 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
take a few minutes I'm afraid let me
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
start by asking if I may um if I
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
understand correctly the current change
 
01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
in the eligibility for the EFA is an
 
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
expansion of the poverty you know to now
 
01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
500 percent from a lower limit and also
 
01:03:11.569 --> 01:03:11.579 align:start position:0%
you know this at risk subgroups do I
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
understand that correctly that for the
 
01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
higher limit is for these at-risk
 
01:03:19.609 --> 01:03:19.619 align:start position:0%
subgroups okay so you gotta meet both
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
criteria you've got to be within the 500
 
01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
and belong to a high risk that's correct
 
01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
nice well at risk group
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
so I just want to bring up a couple of
 
01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
things which are again my personal
 
01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
experiences representative as
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative Heath was mentioning her
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
upbringing that
 
01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:41.579 align:start position:0%
we strongly believe in public schools we
 
01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:43.980 align:start position:0%
used to live in Walton Massachusetts and
 
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
there came a point when those Public
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
Schools completely failed my eldest
 
01:03:51.049 --> 01:03:51.059 align:start position:0%
child she was ahead of her you know
 
01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
classmates and the teachers just ignored
 
01:03:56.809 --> 01:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
her literally would give her nothing to
 
01:03:58.970 --> 01:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
do we spoke with the teachers and said
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
look we don't ask for an equal amount of
 
01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
time but could you just give her an
 
01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
assignment at the beginning check on her
 
01:04:05.089 --> 01:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
at the end maybe once in the middle of
 
01:04:07.069 --> 01:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
the class we understand you gotta focus
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
more time on the kids who are falling
 
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
behind no problem with that nothing
 
01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
happened we spoke with the principal
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
nothing happened so in the middle of the
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
year we had to pull our kids out of the
 
01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
public schools that were absolutely
 
01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
failing my child after making every
 
01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
effort we could and take her to you know
 
01:04:26.089 --> 01:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
Catholic School our lady is an academy
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
and welcome frankly you know we're in
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
the wrong state for me to plug them in
 
01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
these hearings but they are an amazing
 
01:04:31.859 --> 01:04:32.930 align:start position:0%
these hearings but they are an amazing
School

01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
School
 
01:04:35.329 --> 01:04:35.339 align:start position:0%
we didn't get a penny right
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
we just had to pay and all that taxpayer
 
01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
tax taxpayer money that went to our
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
public schools to educate my kid did not
 
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
educate my kid my kid was left
 
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.150 align:start position:0%
educate my kid my kid was left
uneducated

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
uneducated
 
01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
and you know I had to pay out of my
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
pocket I don't I I'm still bitter about
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
it I don't think that was fair yes we
 
01:04:55.849 --> 01:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
could afford it and we happily did it
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
but there was a duty that the state
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
assumed to provide a good education to
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
my child that they failed to deliver and
 
01:05:04.849 --> 01:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
that's the state of Massachusetts at
 
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
that time
 
01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
when we moved to Windham we moved to
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
Windham for the public schools they are
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
great Public Schools you know we are
 
01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:14.339 align:start position:0%
committed to them my kids went there had
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
a great experience we were fortunate
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
enough to be able to move to a town
 
01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
where you know the schools met the
 
01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
expectations and served our kids
 
01:05:23.329 --> 01:05:23.339 align:start position:0%
properly I served on the school board
 
01:05:25.609 --> 01:05:25.619 align:start position:0%
I'm currently running again for the
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
school board because I am committed to
 
01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
making sure those scores are the best
 
01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
they can be
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
but I'm looking at you know talking
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
about expanding this to everyone
 
01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
we had a family a neighbor of ours that
 
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
had four kids both of them were doctors
 
01:05:42.289 --> 01:05:42.299 align:start position:0%
every one of those kids went to Catholic
 
01:05:45.049 --> 01:05:45.059 align:start position:0%
school they were living basically 72
 
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars every year on the table
 
01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
because they were passing on our about
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
eighteen thousand dollar a year a kid
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
education and taking their kids to
 
01:05:55.609 --> 01:05:55.619 align:start position:0%
public school those people would still
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
not get a dollar under the efas right we
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
expanding it to you know people who
 
01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
already really have that school choice
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
we have you know to expand it for the
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
people who even if they somehow can
 
01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
barely make ends meet and send their
 
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
kids they are suffering hardships
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
because of that this is not meant for
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know people like me people like my
 
01:06:19.549 --> 01:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
neighbors who you know were fine doing
 
01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
that but
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think about you know the
 
01:06:26.329 --> 01:06:26.339 align:start position:0%
best comparison and
 
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
probably this is a topic that's not
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
quite directly relevant but when we
 
01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:33.299 align:start position:0%
provide health care right there are two
 
01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
models in Europe in providing public
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
health care for everyone one is the
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
British model where the government is
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
trying to be both the payer and the
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
deliverer of services versus the German
 
01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
Healthcare where the government collects
 
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
the funds and then uses a mix of public
 
01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
and private there are different policy
 
01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
options to providing education and I
 
01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:53.029 align:start position:0%
options to providing education and I
think

01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:06:56.329 --> 01:06:56.339 align:start position:0%
we should consider whichever mix of
 
01:06:58.490 --> 01:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
policies we have that would best serve
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
our kids
 
01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
and really
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
our schools benefit
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
from this program there have been
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
research studies showing that when you
 
01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
know people start having the ability to
 
01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
move public school start start doing
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
better because they have to improve and
 
01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
innovate to retain those kids and we all
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
benefit so
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
I would argue that
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
allowing parents to do what's right for
 
01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
their kids and providing some measure of
 
01:07:31.849 --> 01:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
limited support for them under specific
 
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
limited circumstances is good policy and
 
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:07:38.089 --> 01:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate you know hearing
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
everybody's perspective and
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
we are a committee because we bring a
 
01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
lot of different perspectives to the
 
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
table and
 
01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:47.339 align:start position:0%
one of the great things about this
 
01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
Committee in particular is that you know
 
01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
we really listen to each other and
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say you know we may not
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
always vote the exact same way but I
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
think we do learn a lot from each other
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate you know hearing all
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
those different perspectives but I had
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
to share mine too on this topic
 
01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.069 align:start position:0%
to share mine too on this topic
yeah

01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
I just have a data question could you
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
tell me how many students you estimate
 
01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:13.980 align:start position:0%
in the new categories that you're
 
01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:15.109 align:start position:0%
in the new categories that you're
defining

01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
defining
 
01:08:17.209 --> 01:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
for the EMAs I don't have that
 
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
information because we don't know how
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
many are going to be taking advantage of
 
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
it so
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner okay like I can
 
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:25.980 align:start position:0%
tell you I don't know how many kids fit
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
into I know how many kids for the child
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
with a disability
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
um you know and I know some of these
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
categories but other categories we don't
 
01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
yeah so like another six what it is I
 
01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
don't know how many people with a
 
01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:39.470 align:start position:0%
don't know how many people with a
disability

01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
disability
 
01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
are 500 of the federal poverty level or
 
01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:45.530 align:start position:0%
are 500 of the federal poverty level or
below

01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:48.289 --> 01:08:48.299 align:start position:0%
right uh thank you Mr chairman
 
01:08:48.299 --> 01:08:49.070 align:start position:0%
right uh thank you Mr chairman
um

01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:52.150 --> 01:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
adult education how many
 
01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
adults in state prison or or even the
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
county jails do you service under the
 
01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
adult because we have a big problem here
 
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
65 percent of the those folks do not
 
01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
have a high school education or
 
01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
equivalent so if we expect them to
 
01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
because they're gonna a lot of them will
 
01:09:12.169 --> 01:09:12.179 align:start position:0%
be getting out on the in the public yeah
 
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
and I mean it's just uh if you don't if
 
01:09:16.669 --> 01:09:16.679 align:start position:0%
they don't have a trade or whatever if
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
they if they can't function they'll be
 
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
right back in there so recidivism is
 
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
very high so that actually doesn't come
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
through our adult dad program we have
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
Granite State High School which is a
 
01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
separately chartered New Hampshire High
 
01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
School that provides education in the
 
01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
prison system so we basically operate a
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
high school in the prison that we we
 
01:09:38.329 --> 01:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
support and we fund is that both state
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
prison and county jails so the county
 
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
jails we do not have educational
 
01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:42.900 align:start position:0%
programming typically in the county
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
jails the individuals are there for 30
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
days or less there are some
 
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
circumstances where they're longer but
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
01:09:51.530 --> 01:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
um they're long enough to be able to
 
01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
engage them like the turnover is too
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
high to be able to engage them in
 
01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
education programming as opposed to in
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
prison where we have individuals for a
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
number of years and we're able to work
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
with them every year I speak at a
 
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
graduation both at the women's prison
 
01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:06.780 align:start position:0%
and the Men's prison relative to those
 
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
uh inmates and it's it's an incredible
 
01:10:12.169 --> 01:10:12.179 align:start position:0%
experience to see these individuals who
 
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
have you know turned their lives around
 
01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
and said like okay I might have been a
 
01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
knucklehead before but I don't have to
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
be going forward and they're trying to
 
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know to really make something of
 
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
themselves and it's it's a proud moment
 
01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:26.460 align:start position:0%
very you know thank you very much for
 
01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:27.950 align:start position:0%
very you know thank you very much for
that

01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
I just want to confirm that the the
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
dollars that are going to the uh Freedom
 
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
accounts yep are adequacy funds it's not
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
additional dollars the Stars will be
 
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
going somewhere anyway
 
01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
I would be going to a student
 
01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:47.219 align:start position:0%
enroll in public school
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
if a student is enrolled in public
 
01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
school and they choose an education
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
Freedom account then those funds would
 
01:10:53.209 --> 01:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
not go to that public school they would
 
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
go to the education Freedom account
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
right so this is not additional dollars
 
01:10:58.610 --> 01:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
this is reallocational dollars for
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions yeah I I know I
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
have one more comment uh Mr chair uh
 
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
when you when you expounded on uh you
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
know schools competing against each
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
other in districts I believe in Indiana
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
and you might have been there also they
 
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
actually advertise on billboards come to
 
01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
this District because we have this you
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
know great math program or whatever and
 
01:11:25.850 --> 01:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
that you know and they compete among
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
schools and that that's what it's doing
 
01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
is making these uh schools come more
 
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
competitive so there are other states
 
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
that have uh similar programs Indiana
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
Ohio is one that has an open enrollment
 
01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
program where students have more
 
01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
flexibility in terms of moving around
 
01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
you know that is again and what you're
 
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
seeing is more and more of this is
 
01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
evolving across the country right so
 
01:11:49.729 --> 01:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not on the Leading Edge
 
01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
I know some individuals may want us to
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
believe that but there's a lot of other
 
01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
states that have moved much further
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
ahead down this pathway and again the
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
both the the needs of the students the
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
needs of the states and the importance
 
01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
of having an educated citizenry as well
 
01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
as you know the national uh phenomena of
 
01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment rates as well
 
01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
are these kind of external forces that
 
01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
are causing a need for evolution and
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
change and the status quo is not going
 
01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
to be able to meet those going forward
 
01:12:23.689 --> 01:12:23.699 align:start position:0%
yes I'm going to change the subject
 
01:12:23.699 --> 01:12:24.950 align:start position:0%
yes I'm going to change the subject
completely

01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
completely
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
help me with preschool commissioner can
 
01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
we do it please how can we figure out
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
how to find money in this huge budget
 
01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
that you have that I really do find I
 
01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:37.820 align:start position:0%
cannot believe just the line for um
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
memberships in different organizations
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
is so much more than it used to be when
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
I was Deputy we really charge a lot for
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
that don't they I they really do
 
01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
um but you get a lot from it but
 
01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
um across our country
 
01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
Most states except the six provide
 
01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:57.910 align:start position:0%
Most states except the six provide
state-funded

01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
state-funded
 
01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
pre-public Pre-K
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
um and in my bill 620 we're simply
 
01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
asking for a a pilot and early learning
 
01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
do you think that this is a feasible ask
 
01:13:14.209 --> 01:13:14.219 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
um well as you'll notice that I do have
 
01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
on my positions I propose to Early
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
Childhood positions relative to that
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
um and then I think as you know
 
01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:25.140 align:start position:0%
Christine the Deputy Commissioner has
 
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
been working yes
 
01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
um around this quite a bit uh to try and
 
01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
move forward so we'll see where that
 
01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:33.229 align:start position:0%
move forward so we'll see where that
goes

01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
goes
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
So to that at that point it I wrote down
 
01:13:36.239 --> 01:13:37.490 align:start position:0%
So to that at that point it I wrote down
conditional

01:13:37.490 --> 01:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
conditional
 
01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:40.140 align:start position:0%
so if that if it doesn't become
 
01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:41.630 align:start position:0%
so if that if it doesn't become
law

01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:13:43.729 --> 01:13:43.739 align:start position:0%
uh then the you're not going to hire
 
01:13:45.649 --> 01:13:45.659 align:start position:0%
these two or you're going to hire them
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
correct no so I if well first of all if
 
01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
you don't approve them I'm not going to
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
hire them you know I'm talking about the
 
01:13:53.689 --> 01:13:53.699 align:start position:0%
whole preschool yeah so these anticipate
 
01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
working towards some of the pilots and
 
01:13:57.530 --> 01:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
some of the other activities in the
 
01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
but we're still on your agenda so
 
01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
whatever you okay so then I think we'll
 
01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
let Amy uh come up and talk about
 
01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
School building Aid
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to push her in the hot seats
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
you want to stay up for this one
 
01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to run away he's trying to
 
01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:22.610 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to run away he's trying to
escape

01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:54.970 --> 01:14:54.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:04.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:07.460 align:start position:0%
my page today
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:15:12.649 --> 01:15:12.659 align:start position:0%
good morning still morning uh for the
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
record my name is Amy Clark and I'm with
 
01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education I'm the
 
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
administrator for a program called
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
school facilities and uh building aid
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
program falls under my program I feel
 
01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
like I've already gone through this
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
presentation with you yes uh so I won't
 
01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
go Page by Page
 
01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:32.270 align:start position:0%
go Page by Page
um

01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
I kind of had forgotten about that but
 
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
um real quickly
 
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
um just the handout here is probably
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
something you've seen before this is a
 
01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
summary of our program and I'm really
 
01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
here to answer any questions that you
 
01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:47.630 align:start position:0%
here to answer any questions that you
have

01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
answers I know and normally just
 
01:15:51.850 --> 01:15:51.860 align:start position:0%
normally this might be more of a capital
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
presentation but I know that there are
 
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
funds in the general funds relative to
 
01:15:57.410 --> 01:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
building a which is one of the reasons
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
why we thought it appropriate that we're
 
01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.370 align:start position:0%
why we thought it appropriate that we're
here

01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
um thank you it's always great to see
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
you and
 
01:16:08.209 --> 01:16:08.219 align:start position:0%
um you know what really really really
 
01:16:11.330 --> 01:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
would be helpful if you could um talk
 
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
about some of the building Aid bills
 
01:16:16.729 --> 01:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
that we have um because we have I am I'm
 
01:16:18.649 --> 01:16:18.659 align:start position:0%
putting you on the spot right no I'm
 
01:16:21.050 --> 01:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
familiar with all of them I think so you
 
01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
might be right he really is top-notch
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
um because um that would be helpful in
 
01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
terms of our thinking and then again in
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
terms of thinking
 
01:16:33.649 --> 01:16:33.659 align:start position:0%
you know our our public school districts
 
01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
have gone for a long time with the
 
01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
moratorium um and it's been tough on
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
many school districts and I know we've
 
01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:42.179 align:start position:0%
heard from Michael Cahill
 
01:16:44.290 --> 01:16:44.300 align:start position:0%
I hear from him every day
 
01:16:48.169 --> 01:16:48.179 align:start position:0%
so we do too yeah
 
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
um so you know I I understand his lament
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely but um
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
one just one comment I am troubled by
 
01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
the um capital budget items appearing in
 
01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund so that that's
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
a comment I know she does not that's
 
01:17:07.850 --> 01:17:07.860 align:start position:0%
that's a Governor's budget but if if you
 
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
could kind of allude to what it would
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
mean some of these bills I think it
 
01:17:14.689 --> 01:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
would help all of us in our um thinking
 
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have to work on
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
this pretty soon so would um
 
01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
if you could talk to some of those would
 
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:26.930 --> 01:17:26.940 align:start position:0%
yeah right exactly so
 
01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:27.470 align:start position:0%
yeah right exactly so
um

01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
so we're happy to come back and like
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
address a specific Bill and tell you
 
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
what our thoughts are I know that many
 
01:17:35.209 --> 01:17:35.219 align:start position:0%
of these bills are over in education and
 
01:17:38.209 --> 01:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
they're being as a policy debated there
 
01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
so we're not sure we don't even know
 
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
what the education policy committee
 
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
wants to bring to finance at this point
 
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
in time so we don't want to get out over
 
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
our skis if that's possible I mean is
 
01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
there a specific question you have
 
01:17:51.649 --> 01:17:51.659 align:start position:0%
relative to a bill but I don't think
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
that we're prepared to kind of I don't
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
think you have them all memorized like
 
01:17:57.649 --> 01:17:57.659 align:start position:0%
enumerated you know no I certainly could
 
01:17:59.149 --> 01:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
talk about this graph a little bit which
 
01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
would help you understand and read those
 
01:18:04.729 --> 01:18:04.739 align:start position:0%
bills if that helps actually we we've
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
got we've got two or three bills
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
directly yes we already have
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
so you have you have three Finance bills
 
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:12.890 align:start position:0%
so you have you have three Finance bills
yes

01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
um and so if you turn to this one with a
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
graph I think that no understanding this
 
01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
graph will help you read through those
 
01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.330 align:start position:0%
graph will help you read through those
bills

01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
um and that sounds good uh and so on
 
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
this graph just keep in mind that uh
 
01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
there is a what we call a tail which is
 
01:18:33.169 --> 01:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
those obligated funds for past projects
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
um in this graph that's that dark blue
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
bar but it's also the second column
 
01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
there the so fiscal 24 says 20.6 million
 
01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:42.890 align:start position:0%
there the so fiscal 24 says 20.6 million
dollars

01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
um so then
 
01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:48.900 align:start position:0%
um the light blue bar the one on top the
 
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
sits on top is the state Bond payment
 
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
that was taken out in 2010 uh and that
 
01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
amount is for fiscal 24 is that 6.8
 
01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:00.890 align:start position:0%
amount is for fiscal 24 is that 6.8
million

01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
and then currently so if you add those
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
two together the two solid bars that's
 
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
27.4 you can see that's in the fourth
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
column of that table
 
01:19:13.729 --> 01:19:13.739 align:start position:0%
right now I guess important to note that
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
currently in the law building it is Cap
 
01:19:18.649 --> 01:19:18.659 align:start position:0%
at 50 million dollars
 
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
um that's the current that's what all
 
01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
three of those bills kind of Target that
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
language so right now the maximum amount
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
of appropriation is 50 million less
 
01:19:31.729 --> 01:19:31.739 align:start position:0%
these two solid bars so that's that one
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
two three the second to the last column
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
is 50 Min 50 million less are two
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
obligations one is to the state Bond
 
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
payment one is to pass projects that
 
01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
would leave
 
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
22.6 million uh four new projects if the
 
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
maximum amount of was appropriated if
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
that ceiling was hit appropriated which
 
01:19:56.450 --> 01:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
I believe is what is in
 
01:19:59.090 --> 01:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
um the governor's budget right now uh
 
01:20:03.229 --> 01:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
proposal so that is the 22.6 million
 
01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
would be obligated for new projects uh
 
01:20:08.450 --> 01:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
and that's how the law currently works
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
so now the bills proposed different
 
01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
ceiling amounts in different ways of
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
creating a different fund for it
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund and so forth but that
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
essentially is in a nutshell what that
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
looks like thank you Mr chair we had a
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
wonderful conversation in the hallway
 
01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.709 align:start position:0%
wonderful conversation in the hallway
about

01:20:27.709 --> 01:20:27.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:20:27.719 --> 01:20:29.090 align:start position:0%
about
um what-ifs

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
um what-ifs
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
um and uh in terms of building Aid if we
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
were to raise the um
 
01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:38.030 align:start position:0%
were to raise the um
the cap

01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
the cap
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
um to 60 million
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
or to 70 million let's say if we raised
 
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
it to 70 million how many projects
 
01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
would you be able to fund across our
 
01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
state uh sure
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I think I knew you were going to ask
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
that question and I knew you could
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
answer our question on my phone rings a
 
01:20:59.450 --> 01:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
lot once once uh Governor sununu
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh 75 million everyone and
 
01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
wanted to know where that leaves them on
 
01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
the list so if you go to page six again
 
01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:07.739 align:start position:0%
if you look at the page numbers it's
 
01:21:10.990 --> 01:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
this top right corner uh page six of 11
 
01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
is the approved list
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
um and it really depends on the way the
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
bill is written because if it just
 
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
raises the cap that doesn't require
 
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
let's say it raises the cap to 60 it
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't require 60 million be
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
appropriated unless it changes it from a
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
minimum to a maximum which I know that
 
01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
is under those bills as well so right
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
now it's a maximum of 50 million which
 
01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean 50 million will be
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
appropriated but just the maximum I
 
01:21:39.709 --> 01:21:39.719 align:start position:0%
think the bills all change that maximum
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
to a minimum so for example if it was a
 
01:21:46.689 --> 01:21:46.699 align:start position:0%
minimum amount the top three projects
 
01:21:50.930 --> 01:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
hit about the 49 million which is what
 
01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
would be appropriated for new projects
 
01:21:56.510 --> 01:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
across the biennium and so if you just
 
01:21:59.090 --> 01:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
add those numbers up all the way through
 
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to get to see actually I'll
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
just let me so what you'll see is the
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
fourth ranked project is conquered for
 
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
70 million State contribution so
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
that would well um keep in mind um so
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
there's one thing that's really
 
01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
important to note on this list this list
 
01:22:18.410 --> 01:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
is their estimated project cost times
 
01:22:19.970 --> 01:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
their building Aid rate that they
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
qualify for this is what they're asking
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
for it is very very important to know
 
01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
that this isn't what they're eligible
 
01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
for this is what they're asking for
 
01:22:33.770 --> 01:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
they're simply it's a simple calculation
 
01:22:36.169 --> 01:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
how much is their project times the rate
 
01:22:39.050 --> 01:22:39.060 align:start position:0%
they qualify for is this estimated Aid
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
there's a little asterisk and it's hard
 
01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:42.300 align:start position:0%
to see but it brings you all the way
 
01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
back to the bottom of the table just
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
letting you know that this is just a
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
this is just what they are asking for so
 
01:22:51.890 --> 01:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
um a good example is that Concord might
 
01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
be asking for that amount of money but
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
if they're over building their facility
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
beyond the allowable specifications they
 
01:23:01.729 --> 01:23:01.739 align:start position:0%
may not get all of that 70 million
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
and so but if they did then that that's
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to take you know an additional 70
 
01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
million dollars to fund and it's hard to
 
01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
um we're not quite through the review of
 
01:23:11.810 --> 01:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
the next two projects those should be
 
01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
done pretty soon
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
um and then we'll be on Project five
 
01:23:17.810 --> 01:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
well right now we're on Project four of
 
01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
reviewing it and then we'll we're
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
reviewing four and five at the same time
 
01:23:23.209 --> 01:23:23.219 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm going back to my thing
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
that if if a school district which
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
already has millions of dollars worth of
 
01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.649 align:start position:0%
already has millions of dollars worth of
property

01:23:30.649 --> 01:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
gives away
 
01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
some property without a vote of the
 
01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
people that own that property then they
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
should be discounted from getting money
 
01:23:41.930 --> 01:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
from this you can't be giving away stuff
 
01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
and then asking us to give you 70 or 28
 
01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
million or 2.8 million or whatever when
 
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
you might have given away 2.8 million if
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
you gave away three buildings so
 
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
is that anywhere in there or do we have
 
01:23:58.430 --> 01:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
to add it in the law depending on how
 
01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
specific if you were to there is a
 
01:24:03.410 --> 01:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
requirement that you pay building Aid
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
back if you're not using that facility
 
01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
for intended purposes for 20 years so
 
01:24:10.010 --> 01:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
within the first 20 years we're good
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
like they'd have to pay every every
 
01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
penny back
 
01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
um outside that window
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
um that's not clear in the law so that's
 
01:24:21.169 --> 01:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
certainly essentially what the
 
01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:22.860 align:start position:0%
commissioner said it's just a probably
 
01:24:24.410 --> 01:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
an edit to the law that would be needed
 
01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
I mean I think another important part
 
01:24:31.970 --> 01:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
too is I mean if they sell a building
 
01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
as if they receive proceeds outside of
 
01:24:37.729 --> 01:24:37.739 align:start position:0%
the building a process right
 
01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
we take those off the top before we
 
01:24:42.770 --> 01:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
start to calculate the aid yes so if
 
01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
they got a building and they sell it for
 
01:24:45.890 --> 01:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
2.8 million dollars we're not going to
 
01:24:48.530 --> 01:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
pay building Aid on that contribution
 
01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:51.250 align:start position:0%
pay building Aid on that contribution
good

01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:51.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so my question by the way uh
 
01:24:56.930 --> 01:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
at some point we'll talk about
 
01:24:58.970 --> 01:24:58.980 align:start position:0%
potentially different ways of funding
 
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
building Aid I'm sure but for now I'm
 
01:25:02.570 --> 01:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
asking this question under the current
 
01:25:04.729 --> 01:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
rules which are that we are paying you
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
know up front so only the first you know
 
01:25:09.649 --> 01:25:09.659 align:start position:0%
projects that we have money for get
 
01:25:09.659 --> 01:25:11.630 align:start position:0%
projects that we have money for get
qualified

01:25:11.630 --> 01:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.010 align:start position:0%
qualified
um

01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
if for example we get you know let's
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
assume that for now the estimating
 
01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
building Aid is what they'll be eligible
 
01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
for just to keep things simple we all
 
01:25:24.649 --> 01:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
understand that's not gonna be the case
 
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
so that brings us to pretty much you
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
know 50 50 or so million available to
 
01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
450 or so million being spent with
 
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
pretty much neatly find the top three
 
01:25:36.890 --> 01:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
projects so that would imply that if we
 
01:25:39.530 --> 01:25:39.540 align:start position:0%
add 25 million that would make those
 
01:25:40.970 --> 01:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
funds available but the next project
 
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
needs 70.
 
01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
what happens if you know we say Okay
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
keeping the same formula not making any
 
01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
changes we are offering Concord only 25
 
01:25:53.209 --> 01:25:53.219 align:start position:0%
million that's all we have
 
01:25:55.729 --> 01:25:55.739 align:start position:0%
for their project
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know what they have to vote and see
 
01:26:00.410 --> 01:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
if the voters would approve building it
 
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
even with that limited amount of Aid or
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
will they wait two years to then
 
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
hopefully jump to the top of the line
 
01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
what what how how do we handle those
 
01:26:12.649 --> 01:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
situations in general I know that we
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
spoke in the past about you know voters
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
have to approve and if they don't
 
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
approve it and you get knocked on off
 
01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
the list and the next in line gets to it
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's so hard to say right
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
now who's going to get funding because
 
01:26:25.370 --> 01:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of variables but
 
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
what happens in a situation like this
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
where you have just a huge project
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
waiting right outside of what we have
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
currently funded that would basically
 
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
soak up every amount of dollars we could
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
possibly put in and you'd never get past
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
them anyway so under the current funding
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
formula how are under the current
 
01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
um uh law it's a partial Grant they'd be
 
01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
offered a partial Grant of whatever is
 
01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
remaining whether that be 700 000 or 25
 
01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
million dollars whatever was remaining
 
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
they'd offer it and they would be done
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
but there's no obligation to continue to
 
01:27:02.689 --> 01:27:02.699 align:start position:0%
pay them across the biennium there is an
 
01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
obligation between by any um between
 
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
year and one and year two we finished
 
01:27:09.169 --> 01:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
paying off but once the biennium's
 
01:27:09.179 --> 01:27:10.129 align:start position:0%
paying off but once the biennium's
complete

01:27:10.129 --> 01:27:10.139 align:start position:0%
complete
 
01:27:10.139 --> 01:27:10.850 align:start position:0%
complete
um

01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
they don't get any more money if they
 
01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
reject that and say like well you're not
 
01:27:14.810 --> 01:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
going to give us 70 you're only going to
 
01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
give us 25 then and they say like no
 
01:27:18.649 --> 01:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
we're not interested then we just take
 
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
the next one on the list this year but
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
next year presumably you know next
 
01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
biennium presumably conquered to be
 
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
re-evaluated but because they were you
 
01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
know at the top of the current pool
 
01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
likely not many people will jump ahead
 
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
so that I'm trying to understand what
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
are the two years down the road Fourier
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:49.729 --> 01:27:49.739 align:start position:0%
biennium you know Concord might be eight
 
01:27:51.890 --> 01:27:51.900 align:start position:0%
on the list depending on who applies at
 
01:27:53.629 --> 01:27:53.639 align:start position:0%
that point in time right the likelihood
 
01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
of that that's a possibility you know
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
whether it's likely or not that's
 
01:27:57.719 --> 01:27:59.930 align:start position:0%
whether it's likely or not that's
unknown

01:27:59.930 --> 01:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
unknown
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
um so there is a you know there like
 
01:28:03.649 --> 01:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that there is a way to
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
jump It's a higher life safety points
 
01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
and they jump over whoever's um however
 
01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:09.169 align:start position:0%
and they jump over whoever's um however
um

01:28:09.169 --> 01:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
in the past building Aid has been very
 
01:28:14.810 --> 01:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
volatile so that it would be uh it's
 
01:28:16.129 --> 01:28:16.139 align:start position:0%
hard to tell what any one school
 
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
district would do but there's never been
 
01:28:20.450 --> 01:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
a promise for building a the next year
 
01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
so that would be quite the risk to say
 
01:28:25.010 --> 01:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
hey not 25 not only that construction
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
costs play a big role for schools to
 
01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:28.430 align:start position:0%
costs play a big role for schools to
wait

01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
wait
 
01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
um but some schools would have to wait
 
01:28:31.370 --> 01:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
because they can't fund their project
 
01:28:33.169 --> 01:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
regardless they might not be able to
 
01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
fund the project if they don't get all
 
01:28:35.629 --> 01:28:35.639 align:start position:0%
of it
 
01:28:37.610 --> 01:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
um or if they would not get voter
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
approval or I mean it's not
 
01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
right and just for the record I I was
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
impressed by the approach that the
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
Concord school district is taking in
 
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
terms of setting money aside and trying
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
to flatten you know I mean that's
 
01:28:52.129 --> 01:28:52.139 align:start position:0%
actually a commendable approach that I'd
 
01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:54.780 align:start position:0%
like to see more of in the state so it's
 
01:28:56.570 --> 01:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
just that again they need voter approval
 
01:28:59.209 --> 01:28:59.219 align:start position:0%
you know voter approval is never
 
01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
something that's easy to uh you know
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
figure out so
 
01:29:06.110 --> 01:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
okay I think I understand this but
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
technically we could also have a
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
scenario where everybody gets about
 
01:29:11.330 --> 01:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
three quarters of what they are asking
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
and then Concord doesn't get enough and
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
their voter is rejected and then we
 
01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
would be finding a few more projects
 
01:29:19.010 --> 01:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
down the line as funds become available
 
01:29:24.530 --> 01:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:26.090 --> 01:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
I'm good
 
01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:28.310 align:start position:0%
I'm good
continue

01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:29:29.930 --> 01:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
um well again I'm here for really your
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
questions I I think it's important to
 
01:29:33.890 --> 01:29:33.900 align:start position:0%
note for those bills specifically um
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
what that graph looks like uh and it
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
also gives you an idea of where
 
01:29:41.570 --> 01:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
um the numbers uh I think what's also
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
tricky if you actually look at the line
 
01:29:45.890 --> 01:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
item in the budget
 
01:29:50.810 --> 01:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
um it says for fiscal 24 it says it
 
01:29:52.689 --> 01:29:52.699 align:start position:0%
probably says
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
44 uh 42.6 because what the the state
 
01:30:00.169 --> 01:30:00.179 align:start position:0%
obligation isn't in there you won't see
 
01:30:03.169 --> 01:30:03.179 align:start position:0%
an even 50 million on that line item you
 
01:30:04.729 --> 01:30:04.739 align:start position:0%
won't see that even 50 million because
 
01:30:07.490 --> 01:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
the the state Bond payment isn't in the
 
01:30:09.169 --> 01:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
education trust fund line I know there
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
are these Treasures yeah but that state
 
01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
Bond payment you know
 
01:30:14.930 --> 01:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
um is is missing from there so it should
 
01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:16.030 align:start position:0%
um is is missing from there so it should
be

01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:30:18.290 --> 01:30:18.300 align:start position:0%
42.6 million
 
01:30:20.990 --> 01:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
um for that first fiscal year anyway and
 
01:30:22.970 --> 01:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
a little bit less for the next one or a
 
01:30:27.970 --> 01:30:27.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
thank you so since we were talking about
 
01:30:33.530 --> 01:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
you were mentioning earlier um you know
 
01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
minimum and maximum spending the current
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
statute sets a cap of and there are uh
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
proposals that would set a floor of
 
01:30:45.530 --> 01:30:45.540 align:start position:0%
given how many schools
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
projects we have that are already
 
01:30:50.209 --> 01:30:50.219 align:start position:0%
reviewed and are considered eligible
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
is there any risk that if we don't set a
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
specific floor you won't spend every
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
dollar of building a that we are agree
 
01:31:00.890 --> 01:31:00.900 align:start position:0%
you know approving for you given again
 
01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
how big this pipeline is this in this
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
biennium I'm not talking about future
 
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
um can you repeat your question my
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
question let me rephrase it
 
01:31:14.570 --> 01:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
I don't want to put you on the spot in
 
01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
asking you know legislative questions
 
01:31:17.870 --> 01:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
but does the department feel the need
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
that there is any
 
01:31:22.669 --> 01:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
need for a floor to be set this year
 
01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
given that we have such a long list of
 
01:31:27.290 --> 01:31:27.300 align:start position:0%
building AIDS projects that are already
 
01:31:29.770 --> 01:31:29.780 align:start position:0%
deemed eligible that would you know
 
01:31:32.330 --> 01:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
ensure that any amount we allocate would
 
01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
pretty much be spent to the max
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
so I think part of the problem with the
 
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
floor is again we don't know who is
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
going to take it or not take it so if we
 
01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
right if if we can't get any takers on a
 
01:31:43.310 --> 01:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
partial funding
 
01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
then I can't get to the floor and so I
 
01:31:46.910 --> 01:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
don't know who I'd give the money to at
 
01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
that point well we have 17 projects and
 
01:31:51.530 --> 01:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
three get funded but if somebody says
 
01:31:53.330 --> 01:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
like if if nobody is like you know if
 
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
you have 700 000 left and I gotta spend
 
01:31:57.709 --> 01:31:57.719 align:start position:0%
that 700 000 and nobody just wants 700
 
01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
000 right so what do I get there so okay
 
01:32:02.689 --> 01:32:02.699 align:start position:0%
I think so there's then if you gotta you
 
01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
have to remember historically there has
 
01:32:06.770 --> 01:32:06.780 align:start position:0%
been a More poem in place now since 2008
 
01:32:10.129 --> 01:32:10.139 align:start position:0%
and so the longer we go without funding
 
01:32:12.530 --> 01:32:12.540 align:start position:0%
a large quantity of projects the one the
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
more expensive projects get so one
 
01:32:16.490 --> 01:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
project now might cost what three costs
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
in 2012 for example but the longer the
 
01:32:21.890 --> 01:32:21.900 align:start position:0%
pipeline gets each year too so I think
 
01:32:23.209 --> 01:32:23.219 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue to see the
 
01:32:25.370 --> 01:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
pipeline grow each year and you have to
 
01:32:26.689 --> 01:32:26.699 align:start position:0%
remember the Department of Education
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
accepts applications every other year in
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
July so the list that you have right
 
01:32:32.689 --> 01:32:32.699 align:start position:0%
here is a school district's submitted
 
01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
applications to assist Pastor Life Next
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
July you will have another list of
 
01:32:38.209 --> 01:32:38.219 align:start position:0%
applications that have been submitted
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
and some of them may build with or
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
without building AIDS so they won't just
 
01:32:43.729 --> 01:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
not be on the list and some will
 
01:32:45.649 --> 01:32:45.659 align:start position:0%
continue to be on the list until there's
 
01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
CE if it's provided or the school gets
 
01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
so bad that on its own that nothing can
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
be done and they're going to have to
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
find a way to build thank you but I'm
 
01:32:57.530 --> 01:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
just just one last follow-up I'm just
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
trying to understand whether setting of
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
would be productive because technically
 
01:33:04.850 --> 01:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
we may end up with money that we are
 
01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
legally obligated to spend in not one
 
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
place theoretically I'm not saying this
 
01:33:10.970 --> 01:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
year again I agree that this biennium
 
01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
you know we are going to have some
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
takers for every dollar we put I mean
 
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
it's just I'm trying to understand you
 
01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:28.370 align:start position:0%
it's just I'm trying to understand you
know

01:33:28.370 --> 01:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
I offer you a half a million dollars I
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
may have everybody says like right no
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
we'll just we'll take our chances but
 
01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
then what do we do if we have a floor
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
that we are obligated to spend right the
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
them just for I think when one of the
 
01:33:44.450 --> 01:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
bills anywhere it says that it's a
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund so that money would
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
just carry over
 
01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:49.490 align:start position:0%
just carry over
um

01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:50.810 --> 01:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
I mean can I just one other thing
 
01:33:52.129 --> 01:33:52.139 align:start position:0%
relative to this conversation on a
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
building that I think as the legislature
 
01:33:57.110 --> 01:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
considers this is a little bit like our
 
01:33:58.490 --> 01:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
security grants
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
um like what we have to do is like like
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
not have the up and the down like let's
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
just figure out a consistent kind of a
 
01:34:07.490 --> 01:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
funding formula you know maybe it's a
 
01:34:08.930 --> 01:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
per capita maybe it's something like
 
01:34:10.970 --> 01:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
that maybe it just you know maybe it's
 
01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
to each district on a per capita basis
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
and it just sets aside in a trust fund
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
over at the uh you know at the um
 
01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
treasurer's office and when that that
 
01:34:20.810 --> 01:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
district is ready to grab their their
 
01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
piece of the trust fund they could do
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
something with it but just a different
 
01:34:27.169 --> 01:34:27.179 align:start position:0%
approach because this and and uh I
 
01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
expressed this but I think um you know
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative Flatt is on the committee
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
and some other individuals on the
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
building committee it doesn't feel like
 
01:34:35.930 --> 01:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
a very efficient
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
diploma mechanism for deploying capital
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
for buildings it's kind of like who got
 
01:34:41.810 --> 01:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
in line and when did they get in line
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that as opposed to a more
 
01:34:48.250 --> 01:34:48.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:51.649 --> 01:34:51.659 align:start position:0%
the three bills that we came directly to
 
01:34:55.370 --> 01:34:55.380 align:start position:0%
finance which would retained are 541 332
 
01:34:58.129 --> 01:34:58.139 align:start position:0%
and 546. if you want to comment on any
 
01:35:00.649 --> 01:35:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:03.169 --> 01:35:03.179 align:start position:0%
um I guess the only comment would be
 
01:35:06.169 --> 01:35:06.179 align:start position:0%
that here is a here's what we here's
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
what it looks like now that cap is 50
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
million and just to Echo what the
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner said it's the if you look
 
01:35:16.490 --> 01:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
back at this graph you can see the new
 
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
project spending is in that dashed line
 
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's like a little bit then nothing a
 
01:35:22.669 --> 01:35:22.679 align:start position:0%
little bit nothing it is very difficult
 
01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
for schools to plan for a construction
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
project without knowing what is
 
01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:31.860 align:start position:0%
available or thus a steady stream of
 
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
funding or none at all right so so if if
 
01:35:39.050 --> 01:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
um but it's almost like the carrot is
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
there sometimes and sometimes it's not
 
01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'll just say it's difficult
 
01:35:46.129 --> 01:35:46.139 align:start position:0%
for schools to plan without knowing if
 
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
money will be available or not
 
01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
and not having non-lapsing fund so that
 
01:35:53.689 --> 01:35:53.699 align:start position:0%
it grows when necessary
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman my thought as a
 
01:36:00.110 --> 01:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
an attorney in drafting language that
 
01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate to resolve the
 
01:36:04.850 --> 01:36:04.860 align:start position:0%
concern about whether or not funding at
 
01:36:07.129 --> 01:36:07.139 align:start position:0%
a floor could be met
 
01:36:07.139 --> 01:36:07.850 align:start position:0%
a floor could be met
um

01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:07.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:09.410 --> 01:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
you know in cases where those
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
communities don't make a voter approval
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
of the same expenditure you know these
 
01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
are easily
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
drafted around you can create
 
01:36:19.729 --> 01:36:19.739 align:start position:0%
conditional language to meet those you
 
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
know exceptions if the community doesn't
 
01:36:23.930 --> 01:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
approve then the money could lapse I
 
01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
mean you can you can build language that
 
01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
will allow the intent of the Bill of
 
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
keeping a floor of expending to be
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
followed through in such a way that
 
01:36:35.570 --> 01:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't require putting the state in a
 
01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
bad position if voters don't approve of
 
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
those building Aid expenditures I'm just
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
saying you know I can think through
 
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
scenarios that
 
01:36:45.229 --> 01:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
you know I'm sure many capable attorneys
 
01:36:46.850 --> 01:36:46.860 align:start position:0%
across the state and you know supporting
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
the department of Ed could find a way to
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
meet the language that we need to meet
 
01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill to to have a
 
01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:55.310 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill to to have a
floor

01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
um in the event that you know these
 
01:36:58.970 --> 01:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
school systems and districts don't
 
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
approve of the
 
01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
of you know the expenditure so my my
 
01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
point is that this pipeline is so big
 
01:37:07.610 --> 01:37:07.620 align:start position:0%
right now of these um
 
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
you know districts across across the
 
01:37:11.930 --> 01:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
state looking for this funding that
 
01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:13.620 align:start position:0%
um I I think the immediate concern of
 
01:37:15.169 --> 01:37:15.179 align:start position:0%
whether or not you know it could be
 
01:37:17.450 --> 01:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
problematic to have a floor is this is
 
01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
minor item I don't think we should get
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
caught up on that detail because I think
 
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
you know we could easily find a solution
 
01:37:27.169 --> 01:37:27.179 align:start position:0%
to that concern in drafting language so
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
I just like to alleviate the concern
 
01:37:31.729 --> 01:37:31.739 align:start position:0%
that I think we are expressing here so
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have to send the commissioner
 
01:37:35.530 --> 01:37:35.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
and solve my problem there you go that's
 
01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:41.699 align:start position:0%
where it goes and one last question
 
01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
since I'm sure that this committee this
 
01:37:45.890 --> 01:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
subcommit this committee and then the
 
01:37:48.169 --> 01:37:48.179 align:start position:0%
larger finance committee will have a lot
 
01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
of discussions about the proper
 
01:37:52.669 --> 01:37:52.679 align:start position:0%
structure of this program right now the
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
questions that we asked were based on
 
01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
its current you know structure but
 
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:57.550 align:start position:0%
its current you know structure but
obviously

01:37:57.550 --> 01:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:38:00.290 --> 01:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of thoughts on how we
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
could do better
 
01:38:04.850 --> 01:38:04.860 align:start position:0%
do you does the department do you have
 
01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
any thoughts in terms of you know if you
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
were a king for a day what would be an
 
01:38:10.970 --> 01:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
optic optimal way of approaching
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
building aid for now notwithstanding the
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
current backup I understand the current
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
backlog is something that we are aware
 
01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
of but just in long term how should this
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
work you know once we get a handle on it
 
01:38:25.370 --> 01:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
how should we do this long term in your
 
01:38:29.810 --> 01:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
opinion at this point in time just
 
01:38:36.890 --> 01:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:38.090 --> 01:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
and then as we don't have all of the
 
01:38:39.649 --> 01:38:39.659 align:start position:0%
incentives lined up
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
um you know so uh you know it's possible
 
01:38:44.930 --> 01:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
that districts might because they're
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
getting a match be incentivized to build
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
a bigger School than they might need in
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
the long term because they can get 60 of
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
that cost from the state or something
 
01:38:55.129 --> 01:38:55.139 align:start position:0%
like that so we have to get alignment
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
and so my thought around this is maybe
 
01:38:59.330 --> 01:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
more of a sinking fund type of an
 
01:39:00.770 --> 01:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
approach where the legislature is
 
01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
funding a certain amount each district
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
that's going to have to build a school
 
01:39:05.930 --> 01:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
every year it goes into some kind of a
 
01:39:08.209 --> 01:39:08.219 align:start position:0%
trust fund over at the uh the
 
01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
treasurer's office and you know like in
 
01:39:12.530 --> 01:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
in one District's gonna say but we want
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
a new school now well they may not have
 
01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
that much money in their trust fund at
 
01:39:16.970 --> 01:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
that time but that's fine they can come
 
01:39:18.169 --> 01:39:18.179 align:start position:0%
up with the rest of it and they've got
 
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
the incentive to to be as efficient as
 
01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
they can somebody else says like I think
 
01:39:23.629 --> 01:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
we can get a few more years out of it so
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
they get a little bit more State funds
 
01:39:26.330 --> 01:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
build up in that trust fund and then
 
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
when they draw it down they get a little
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
bit bigger bigger State appropriation so
 
01:39:31.970 --> 01:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
some type of a sinking fund type of an
 
01:39:34.189 --> 01:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
approach so that we're not kind of in
 
01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
this the application cycle and and um
 
01:39:40.490 --> 01:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
is what I would basically uh suggest an
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
approach like that so
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
so I would just add to like the
 
01:39:47.930 --> 01:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
sustainability of it is really important
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
because also what happens is that
 
01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:51.709 align:start position:0%
because also what happens is that
schools

01:39:51.709 --> 01:39:51.719 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:39:55.010 --> 01:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
um potentially that are on the list see
 
01:39:56.570 --> 01:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
that this is maybe a one-time
 
01:39:58.850 --> 01:39:58.860 align:start position:0%
opportunity and they might not be
 
01:40:01.490 --> 01:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
building the best project for their
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
Community because it might take them six
 
01:40:07.250 --> 01:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
or more years to get there might take
 
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
them two or three it might take them a
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
fair amount of failed votes but
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
um if there was a dependability then I
 
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
think they would make smarter choices
 
01:40:17.930 --> 01:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
because they wouldn't worry about
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
passing it right now while there's
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
building Aid available we're seeing the
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
same thing it's getting alignment you
 
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
know of objectives right
 
01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
um is what we're trying to do create a
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
system that aligns those Community
 
01:40:30.770 --> 01:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
objectives States objectives with the
 
01:40:33.229 --> 01:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
school systems objectives as well
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of like an added building
 
01:40:37.729 --> 01:40:37.739 align:start position:0%
adequacy a little bit right yeah but
 
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
syncing fun you can't do it use it it
 
01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:41.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't get to go for anything else it
 
01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:48.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:50.350 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:40:50.350 --> 01:40:50.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
I just want to let the committee know
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
that house bill 452
 
01:40:59.149 --> 01:40:59.159 align:start position:0%
is the bill that you don't have it's the
 
01:41:01.490 --> 01:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
bill which looks from everything in
 
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
school moving aid from A to Z to A Whole
 
01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
formula we will be discussing this in
 
01:41:11.149 --> 01:41:11.159 align:start position:0%
policy and you're welcome to attend next
 
01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
Friday at 9 30 in the morning all
 
01:41:15.709 --> 01:41:15.719 align:start position:0%
morning it's dedicated just to the
 
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
school building a this is a bill which
 
01:41:20.090 --> 01:41:20.100 align:start position:0%
we have to have out of committee by the
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
16th so in three days in three days
 
01:41:24.649 --> 01:41:24.659 align:start position:0%
right when you say next Friday the
 
01:41:27.709 --> 01:41:27.719 align:start position:0%
Friday this week not this week one week
 
01:41:37.850 --> 01:41:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:40.490 --> 01:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
yeah so we will be discussing that
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
because the topics that you're just
 
01:41:45.410 --> 01:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
mentioning whether you get paid
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
this thing off as you go through the 20
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
years for whether you know if you lay it
 
01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
on the district on the front side and
 
01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
the interest costs and we're now looking
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
at that right now but we're looking at
 
01:41:59.209 --> 01:41:59.219 align:start position:0%
if you decide you're not going to take
 
01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
this money push it a fourth one in line
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
because I don't want half the money I
 
01:42:05.450 --> 01:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
want the full money there's no guarantee
 
01:42:07.550 --> 01:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
under your present form and you go to
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
the top of the list when the round is
 
01:42:12.169 --> 01:42:12.179 align:start position:0%
considered again you may have another
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
project coming in higher higher need
 
01:42:17.149 --> 01:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
that's going to bump you so all that's
 
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
going to be discussed
 
01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
this is a huge issue it's something
 
01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
I think this question is probably
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
directed us to Amy
 
01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
um if you were to pump punch the numbers
 
01:42:39.609 --> 01:42:39.619 align:start position:0%
and try to determine the best strategy
 
01:42:43.010 --> 01:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
for addressing the current need in the
 
01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:44.990 align:start position:0%
for addressing the current need in the
pipeline

01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
pipeline
 
01:42:47.930 --> 01:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
um moving forward in time so that we
 
01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
don't continue to have this building a
 
01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:51.590 align:start position:0%
don't continue to have this building a
pipeline

01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
pipeline
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
um that becomes so large that we can't
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
fund every project every year so I guess
 
01:42:58.729 --> 01:42:58.739 align:start position:0%
the question is how how many projects
 
01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
would we have to fund on a biennial
 
01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:02.390 align:start position:0%
would we have to fund on a biennial
basis

01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:43:06.169 --> 01:43:06.179 align:start position:0%
to eliminate like this list of growing
 
01:43:08.570 --> 01:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
schools who are kind of at the back end
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
of the list that don't get addressed
 
01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
um is this question clear enough
 
01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:14.530 align:start position:0%
um is this question clear enough
um

01:43:14.530 --> 01:43:14.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:18.169 --> 01:43:18.179 align:start position:0%
so we anticipate you know there's how
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
many schools districts in the state and
 
01:43:24.649 --> 01:43:24.659 align:start position:0%
every 20 years approximately I guess if
 
01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
you are punching the numbers you know
 
01:43:28.250 --> 01:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
how how could we
 
01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
build a more sustainable program of
 
01:43:33.770 --> 01:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
building Aid that addresses on a regular
 
01:43:33.780 --> 01:43:35.149 align:start position:0%
building Aid that addresses on a regular
schedule

01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
01:43:39.050 --> 01:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
meeting this pipeline so that it's not
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
such a huge list and I think this is
 
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
just like for planning purposes it would
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
be helpful to know as a committee you
 
01:43:48.590 --> 01:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
know if the answer is we need to fund 10
 
01:43:51.530 --> 01:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
projects every year so that every 25
 
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
years the first project that is funded
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
can have a new project and that
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
everybody else gets pumped through the
 
01:44:00.290 --> 01:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
list so that I mean in an ideal setting
 
01:44:02.750 --> 01:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
obviously this is we're talking a huge
 
01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
budget if that were to happen but I
 
01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:05.820 align:start position:0%
think he's not very happy that you're
 
01:44:09.229 --> 01:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
happy no I guess yeah
 
01:44:10.669 --> 01:44:10.679 align:start position:0%
do you want to talk about how you've
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
done some of that analysis and well just
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
let me guess real quickly I won't go
 
01:44:16.729 --> 01:44:16.739 align:start position:0%
into all the detail but I mean really is
 
01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
a somewhat simple math in the sense of
 
01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
we have 450 school buildings we will
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
have less in the future there's a lot of
 
01:44:25.370 --> 01:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
consolidation projects but just looking
 
01:44:27.649 --> 01:44:27.659 align:start position:0%
at that and looking at the life of a
 
01:44:29.209 --> 01:44:29.219 align:start position:0%
building before it needs a substantial
 
01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
renovation is between 40 and 50 years
 
01:44:34.129 --> 01:44:34.139 align:start position:0%
um and we're talking about substantial
 
01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:35.580 align:start position:0%
Renovations so when we talk about
 
01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
substantial we are talking about
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
um and if you think about your home and
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
you think about the abuse that school
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
takes a 50 year old building definitely
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
shows its age
 
01:44:49.010 --> 01:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
um so using 50 and 450 only because
 
01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
they're easy numbers it's nine schools a
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
year so 18 a biennium is probably what
 
01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
you'd likely to see so as Caitlyn was
 
01:44:58.370 --> 01:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
mentioning you know the the there's more
 
01:45:00.770 --> 01:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
applications coming and we're likely
 
01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
going to be adding 18 or so obviously
 
01:45:05.450 --> 01:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
it's really difficult to say we meant we
 
01:45:07.370 --> 01:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
had a moratorium for 10 years so there's
 
01:45:10.490 --> 01:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
probably a backlog out there and I think
 
01:45:12.410 --> 01:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
building eight right representative Vlad
 
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
was just mentioning Bill 4 52
 
01:45:18.530 --> 01:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
um about
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
um changing the process so it's a little
 
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
easier for schools to apply for building
 
01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
Aid time wise timeline wise
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
um and so I think that you would see a
 
01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
fair amount of buildings be added to the
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
list can I just I'm going to clarify
 
01:45:34.609 --> 01:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
that because I'm there's not necessarily
 
01:45:35.810 --> 01:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
Universal agreement to the agency
 
01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
relative to that because there are
 
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
variables that that doesn't consider you
 
01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
know we're you know 46 000 fewer
 
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
students today than we were you know
 
01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
when some of these buildings were built
 
01:45:49.129 --> 01:45:49.139 align:start position:0%
and so they're in that queue of building
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
C do we need to rebuild them or do we
 
01:45:52.250 --> 01:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
not need to rebuild them so there's that
 
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
Dimension the other dimension is the
 
01:45:56.930 --> 01:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
level of Maintenance that's taking place
 
01:45:58.250 --> 01:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
relative to a building I mean we have
 
01:45:59.810 --> 01:45:59.820 align:start position:0%
buildings I think what's our oldest like
 
01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:03.970 align:start position:0%
buildings I think what's our oldest like
1930s

01:46:03.970 --> 01:46:03.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
some buildings that have been highly
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
maintained are still very functional and
 
01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
going you know they maybe need some
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
internal re redoing but maybe it's not
 
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
like a whole redo
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
um in terms of you know what's going to
 
01:46:19.010 --> 01:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
take place in that building other
 
01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
buildings have been built very
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
importantly and they're not going to
 
01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
make it 20 years right like there's some
 
01:46:25.129 --> 01:46:25.139 align:start position:0%
the windows are falling out after 10
 
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
years because they didn't put caulking
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
in the uh thing or something so there
 
01:46:32.090 --> 01:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
again I so what happens is this is kind
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
of like this is what I was talking about
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
that top-down approach where we assumed
 
01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
that we can kind of like manage all of
 
01:46:40.490 --> 01:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
this is not synergistically going to get
 
01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
be result in the capital deployment to
 
01:46:44.810 --> 01:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
the right place it's going to be okay
 
01:46:46.609 --> 01:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
I've waited long enough therefore I get
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
to build a new school well it might be
 
01:46:49.010 --> 01:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
20 years later but if you don't need a
 
01:46:50.090 --> 01:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
new school shouldn't we do something
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
else with that Capital should does
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
somebody else need one you know because
 
01:46:56.330 --> 01:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
they had you know a different location
 
01:46:58.970 --> 01:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
or something like that you know so so I
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
I worry
 
01:47:02.330 --> 01:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
um when we try to over oversimplify
 
01:47:04.490 --> 01:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
something that has uh you know quite a
 
01:47:06.290 --> 01:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
number of dynamics that are moving in it
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
and so I think if you're searching for
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
another approach you know uh I like the
 
01:47:13.729 --> 01:47:13.739 align:start position:0%
idea of we need something consistent you
 
01:47:14.930 --> 01:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
know what I mean like there's a regular
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
type of funding towards this
 
01:47:18.649 --> 01:47:18.659 align:start position:0%
um but I think we have to find something
 
01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
that's more synergistic in terms of the
 
01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:22.679 align:start position:0%
deployment of that capital I would I'm
 
01:47:24.290 --> 01:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
just to say I would agree I mean that is
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
a very simplistic approach there's no
 
01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
doubt that there's tons of variables
 
01:47:29.450 --> 01:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
because a lot of the projects are not
 
01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
full rebuild sometimes they're just an
 
01:47:32.209 --> 01:47:32.219 align:start position:0%
addition sometimes they're just
 
01:47:34.370 --> 01:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
renovating a certain Wing So I
 
01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
completely agree that's really a very
 
01:47:38.750 --> 01:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
very basic statement um that I was
 
01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:39.770 align:start position:0%
very basic statement um that I was
making

01:47:39.770 --> 01:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
um but I'd also um mention that another
 
01:47:45.290 --> 01:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
thing to consider would be some kind of
 
01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:47.219 align:start position:0%
assessment of all this that we've talked
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
about it before
 
01:47:51.649 --> 01:47:51.659 align:start position:0%
an assessment of all the state of all
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
the buildings across the state and would
 
01:47:55.370 --> 01:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
give a little bit more of an idea of
 
01:47:58.250 --> 01:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
where we stood and where schools so so
 
01:48:00.590 --> 01:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
for example if somebody if you had an
 
01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
assessment and somebody applied for
 
01:48:03.890 --> 01:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
building aid but they were way down that
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they would get funded
 
01:48:07.010 --> 01:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
because maybe we want to save that money
 
01:48:09.470 --> 01:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
as a state to maybe Target it in
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
different places
 
01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:12.830 align:start position:0%
different places
chairman

01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
thank you some years ago when Alec
 
01:48:19.129 --> 01:48:19.139 align:start position:0%
meeting there was somebody from Arizona
 
01:48:21.649 --> 01:48:21.659 align:start position:0%
worked in Department of Ed
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
brought up the fact that they had a
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
competition for
 
01:48:28.490 --> 01:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
Architects to submit designs for a
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
a school building expandable say from
 
01:48:33.169 --> 01:48:33.179 align:start position:0%
300 to 600
 
01:48:36.410 --> 01:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
and since we're looking at likely 10
 
01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
percent of the cost of the school is the
 
01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:39.950 align:start position:0%
percent of the cost of the school is the
architect

01:48:39.950 --> 01:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
architect
 
01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:41.390 align:start position:0%
architect
so

01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
they had a winner of the contest
 
01:48:46.370 --> 01:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
then the
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
building Aid formula for Arizona here's
 
01:48:51.010 --> 01:48:51.020 align:start position:0%
how much you can save using this design
 
01:48:54.109 --> 01:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
and they said you'd use that design 38
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
times in Arizona saved a lot of money so
 
01:48:59.689 --> 01:48:59.699 align:start position:0%
all these people that want to sit there
 
01:49:02.090 --> 01:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
and argue and then you have Architects
 
01:49:03.770 --> 01:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
that come very fanciful I'm not
 
01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the one that was built in
 
01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:06.910 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the one that was built in
Kingston

01:49:06.910 --> 01:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
Kingston
 
01:49:09.470 --> 01:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
you know they had a lot of wasteful
 
01:49:11.450 --> 01:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
space in it but
 
01:49:13.850 --> 01:49:13.860 align:start position:0%
nobody made much of a decision so if we
 
01:49:17.090 --> 01:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
had a real tough decision contest and
 
01:49:20.330 --> 01:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
got a real good design
 
01:49:22.129 --> 01:49:22.139 align:start position:0%
then that would be part of the offering
 
01:49:25.370 --> 01:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
you want to build this school here
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so um at the department if this is
 
01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
going back
 
01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:29.510 align:start position:0%
going back
um

01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:31.010 --> 01:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
pre-covered it might have been the 2018
 
01:49:34.850 --> 01:49:34.860 align:start position:0%
time frame we worked with some uh design
 
01:49:37.850 --> 01:49:37.860 align:start position:0%
build Finance types of organizations uh
 
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
that you know the school and and they
 
01:49:43.010 --> 01:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
were packaging some tax breaks as well
 
01:49:45.169 --> 01:49:45.179 align:start position:0%
um they would do kind of a build lease
 
01:49:47.090 --> 01:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
back type of a program where if the
 
01:49:49.490 --> 01:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
school district owned the land
 
01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
um then they would actually build the
 
01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:52.510 align:start position:0%
um then they would actually build the
building

01:49:52.510 --> 01:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
lease it to the school for 20 years at
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
less cost than the bond payment and then
 
01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
give it back to the school at the end of
 
01:50:01.490 --> 01:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
the 20 years
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
um hopefully it was in good shape at
 
01:50:04.430 --> 01:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
that point but uh and so it was a net
 
01:50:06.109 --> 01:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
cash flow advantage and they could do
 
01:50:07.129 --> 01:50:07.139 align:start position:0%
this because there were certain tax
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
advantages associated with it the two
 
01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%
difficulties associated with that were
 
01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
one um the financing was fairly complex
 
01:50:16.850 --> 01:50:16.860 align:start position:0%
to explain to voters right to understand
 
01:50:19.010 --> 01:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
what that might look like and the second
 
01:50:21.770 --> 01:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
was that it also required you know it
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
was a modular approach to the schools
 
01:50:24.770 --> 01:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
right so they had these different
 
01:50:27.290 --> 01:50:27.300 align:start position:0%
components of schools and just like a
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
modular home or you know it's more
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
efficient and so you had to put it
 
01:50:31.970 --> 01:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
together but to your point there
 
01:50:33.890 --> 01:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
everybody was everybody had a uniqueness
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
right like my gym has to have this or my
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
Best of You has to look like this or
 
01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
something like that so so we didn't get
 
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
01:50:42.770 --> 01:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
um we had a difficult time getting
 
01:50:44.209 --> 01:50:44.219 align:start position:0%
traction and eventually the finance
 
01:50:46.609 --> 01:50:46.619 align:start position:0%
company decided not to do it so
 
01:50:46.619 --> 01:50:50.709 align:start position:0%
company decided not to do it so
foreign

01:50:50.709 --> 01:50:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:53.330 --> 01:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up on the assessment of the
 
01:50:55.370 --> 01:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
states because obviously we would
 
01:50:57.770 --> 01:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
benefit from having a good understanding
 
01:51:00.530 --> 01:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
of what the you know expected life
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
time is whatever we have left in them
 
01:51:05.930 --> 01:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
and when a replacement uh may be needed
 
01:51:08.450 --> 01:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
but would that be based on the current
 
01:51:10.669 --> 01:51:10.679 align:start position:0%
number of schools or would it include
 
01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
also an assessment of given the way the
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
student population is going
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
how many of those would need to be
 
01:51:20.810 --> 01:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
replaced and how many of those wouldn't
 
01:51:22.729 --> 01:51:22.739 align:start position:0%
and how many of those would benefit from
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
a consolidation you know I'm trying to
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
figure if we're just looking at the
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
facilities they are as they are or we
 
01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
are trying to include and estimate at
 
01:51:34.129 --> 01:51:34.139 align:start position:0%
that State level which may differ from
 
01:51:37.129 --> 01:51:37.139 align:start position:0%
other municipality may want to do but
 
01:51:39.890 --> 01:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
just our thought of what you know may be
 
01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
necessary so I do actually want to
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that there you did
 
01:51:45.770 --> 01:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2 last year this was
 
01:51:47.930 --> 01:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
something that Karen umberger found very
 
01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
important was that you did actually
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
require the Department of Education to
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
do an assessment of all outstanding
 
01:51:56.770 --> 01:51:56.780 align:start position:0%
current facilities
 
01:52:00.109 --> 01:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
now the unfortunate part is is the
 
01:52:01.550 --> 01:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
department hasn't been able to do that
 
01:52:04.250 --> 01:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
work because the funding associated with
 
01:52:07.250 --> 01:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
that assessment was not not provided but
 
01:52:09.169 --> 01:52:09.179 align:start position:0%
that is so basically we would do an
 
01:52:10.490 --> 01:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
assessment everybody would go out look
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
at the current facilities and whatnot as
 
01:52:15.770 --> 01:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
far as an actual assessment of all of
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
the state needs that would be different
 
01:52:20.209 --> 01:52:20.219 align:start position:0%
or potentially could be included if you
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
modify that existing law of course you
 
01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
would still need to provide the funding
 
01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
for the Department to do it so
 
01:52:29.930 --> 01:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:29.940 --> 01:52:31.430 align:start position:0%
thank you
yes

01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:52:33.770 --> 01:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
and we worked with Amy Clark in doing
 
01:52:38.570 --> 01:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:41.930 --> 01:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
the country lend out and and then we
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
came up with that Project based upon
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
what it costs to assess a building with
 
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
an architect uh with an engineer and
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
with policy people and having the same
 
01:52:55.490 --> 01:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
consistent people going out to all the
 
01:52:57.649 --> 01:52:57.659 align:start position:0%
schools in the state by where we are in
 
01:53:00.530 --> 01:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
terms of condition uh and all the
 
01:53:01.850 --> 01:53:01.860 align:start position:0%
different areas which we want to look at
 
01:53:04.669 --> 01:53:04.679 align:start position:0%
from classroom condition curriculum to
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
space available for a special education
 
01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
Etc and uh we were ready to go ahead
 
01:53:11.570 --> 01:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
with that this this idea has been
 
01:53:14.090 --> 01:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
proposed to us for years even going back
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
to Days of Mark Joyce and um each time
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
we and we had a very good bill reason
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
why I didn't go anywhere because you
 
01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:23.639 align:start position:0%
guys didn't fund it 3.3 million dollars
 
01:53:25.390 --> 01:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
those Finance people
 
01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
but the fortunate thing is we took that
 
01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
money and used for public school
 
01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:30.950 align:start position:0%
money and used for public school
interest

01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:53:33.590 --> 01:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructurity and access which is
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay could you for one more time for the
 
01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
people at home and me because I want to
 
01:53:55.209 --> 01:53:55.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay that's how good my memory is
 
01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:00.649 align:start position:0%
okay that's how good my memory is
okay

01:54:00.649 --> 01:54:00.659 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:54:02.629 --> 01:54:02.639 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
no we can uh if you want to take a break
 
01:54:05.570 --> 01:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
we can do that but then we're going to
 
01:54:09.530 --> 01:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
Pivot into adequacy adequacy the
 
01:54:11.090 --> 01:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
question is do you want to take a quick
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
lunch break we're going to go through
 
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposal in detail and
 
01:54:16.490 --> 01:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing it will likely take an hour
 
01:54:18.109 --> 01:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
so if you want to take a lunch or if you
 
01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
want to try to rush through it right now
 
01:54:23.689 --> 01:54:23.699 align:start position:0%
so that you can I'd rather take lunch
 
01:54:25.970 --> 01:54:25.980 align:start position:0%
snow in your commute home and affecting
 
01:54:25.980 --> 01:54:30.790 align:start position:0%
snow in your commute home and affecting
itself

01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
so if there's nothing else Let's uh take
 
01:54:36.649 --> 01:54:36.659 align:start position:0%
a lunch break until one o'clock just
 
01:54:37.970 --> 01:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
because it's easier than saying ten to
 
01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:39.050 align:start position:0%
because it's easier than saying ten to
one

01:54:39.050 --> 01:54:39.060 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:02:05.090 --> 03:02:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:05.100 --> 03:02:08.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:02:08.349 --> 03:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:13.450 --> 03:02:13.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:46.910 --> 03:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:50.710 --> 03:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
sure thank you
 
03:02:52.429 --> 03:02:52.439 align:start position:0%
Mike's Hot
 
03:02:55.070 --> 03:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
um so as I had heard the governor's
 
03:02:57.590 --> 03:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
presentation on on building Aid and he
 
03:03:00.710 --> 03:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
had put in 75 million dollars and I
 
03:03:02.510 --> 03:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
listened to several of the bills that
 
03:03:04.309 --> 03:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
were introduced to the full committee I
 
03:03:04.319 --> 03:03:06.110 align:start position:0%
were introduced to the full committee I
realized

03:03:06.110 --> 03:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
realized
 
03:03:08.990 --> 03:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
that we have an ongoing issue on how we
 
03:03:11.570 --> 03:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
do building Aid we have 20 school
 
03:03:13.910 --> 03:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
districts that are looking for help and
 
03:03:16.370 --> 03:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
even if we funded it at the 75 million
 
03:03:18.650 --> 03:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
dollars as requested by our governor
 
03:03:21.410 --> 03:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
we would cover Concord we would get one
 
03:03:23.090 --> 03:03:23.100 align:start position:0%
more on the list we would go from three
 
03:03:25.370 --> 03:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
facilities to four that are funded in 16
 
03:03:27.230 --> 03:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
schools would still end up with a short
 
03:03:27.240 --> 03:03:28.849 align:start position:0%
schools would still end up with a short
straw

03:03:28.849 --> 03:03:28.859 align:start position:0%
straw
 
03:03:30.830 --> 03:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
so I started rethinking about this in
 
03:03:32.210 --> 03:03:32.220 align:start position:0%
light of some of the other comments made
 
03:03:34.790 --> 03:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
by members of Finance is there a better
 
03:03:36.110 --> 03:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
way to do this
 
03:03:39.050 --> 03:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
and and every child needs some classroom
 
03:03:40.490 --> 03:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
to learn in
 
03:03:43.010 --> 03:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
we homeschool we have a dedicated office
 
03:03:45.469 --> 03:03:45.479 align:start position:0%
space that is our space for children but
 
03:03:47.690 --> 03:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
we fund it as parents but it's I'm not
 
03:03:49.309 --> 03:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
saying that because I'm looking for the
 
03:03:51.230 --> 03:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
state to contribute but we dedicated
 
03:03:53.809 --> 03:03:53.819 align:start position:0%
physical space for for for learning to
 
03:03:55.550 --> 03:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
take place
 
03:03:57.410 --> 03:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
that's true for all public schools
 
03:03:58.969 --> 03:03:58.979 align:start position:0%
that's true for our Charter Schools it's
 
03:04:00.769 --> 03:04:00.779 align:start position:0%
true for everybody there is some spaces
 
03:04:04.490 --> 03:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
that that the education takes place in
 
03:04:06.950 --> 03:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
if we took that same 75 million dollars
 
03:04:09.590 --> 03:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
and allocated it differently you could
 
03:04:14.450 --> 03:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
fund the K-8 students at 450 a child per
 
03:04:14.460 --> 03:04:15.290 align:start position:0%
fund the K-8 students at 450 a child per
year

03:04:15.290 --> 03:04:15.300 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:04:17.990 --> 03:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
to help offset costs
 
03:04:19.969 --> 03:04:19.979 align:start position:0%
you could fund the high school students
 
03:04:22.969 --> 03:04:22.979 align:start position:0%
at 500 a year then that if you do the
 
03:04:26.090 --> 03:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
math for the 110 000 Keith rate students
 
03:04:29.690 --> 03:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
that works to 49.5 million dollars to 53
 
03:04:30.950 --> 03:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
000 high school students who works out
 
03:04:33.110 --> 03:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
to twenty six and a half million for a
 
03:04:35.809 --> 03:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
total of 20 76 million dollars or very
 
03:04:37.370 --> 03:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
close to what the governor had had
 
03:04:37.380 --> 03:04:38.990 align:start position:0%
close to what the governor had had
recommended

03:04:38.990 --> 03:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
03:04:41.269 --> 03:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
part of the rationale for the higher
 
03:04:43.010 --> 03:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
costs for the high school level students
 
03:04:45.230 --> 03:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
are you have additional lab space you
 
03:04:47.389 --> 03:04:47.399 align:start position:0%
have votech classroom space so you have
 
03:04:49.309 --> 03:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
other things that are that are not just
 
03:04:51.889 --> 03:04:51.899 align:start position:0%
typically lunchrooms recess areas and
 
03:04:54.710 --> 03:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
education space right you have you have
 
03:04:56.929 --> 03:04:56.939 align:start position:0%
facilities that are that are a higher
 
03:04:59.030 --> 03:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
cost to build and a higher cost to
 
03:04:59.040 --> 03:05:01.309 align:start position:0%
cost to build and a higher cost to
maintain

03:05:01.309 --> 03:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
03:05:03.469 --> 03:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
heck for even some of the some of the
 
03:05:05.389 --> 03:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
high schools have Auto Repair type
 
03:05:07.370 --> 03:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
facilities all of those extra tools
 
03:05:09.769 --> 03:05:09.779 align:start position:0%
space extra areas require additional
 
03:05:13.070 --> 03:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
funds to run on an annual basis
 
03:05:16.190 --> 03:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
if we instead of funding buildings we
 
03:05:18.290 --> 03:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
funded the classroom space where the
 
03:05:20.269 --> 03:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
education takes place in and we thought
 
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
about it not as building aid but make
 
03:05:24.530 --> 03:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
sure make sure every child has access to
 
03:05:26.889 --> 03:05:26.899 align:start position:0%
a space to learn in
 
03:05:29.929 --> 03:05:29.939 align:start position:0%
we could reallocate this
 
03:05:31.910 --> 03:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
in a semi-permanent or maybe even
 
03:05:35.450 --> 03:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
long-term permanent space to augment the
 
03:05:37.790 --> 03:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
current swept funds that go down to the
 
03:05:37.800 --> 03:05:39.410 align:start position:0%
current swept funds that go down to the
children

03:05:39.410 --> 03:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:05:42.230 --> 03:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
to help facilitate classroom space
 
03:05:44.630 --> 03:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
right and
 
03:05:44.640 --> 03:05:45.349 align:start position:0%
right and
um

03:05:45.349 --> 03:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:47.389 --> 03:05:47.399 align:start position:0%
this would go directly to the towns
 
03:05:49.969 --> 03:05:49.979 align:start position:0%
right it's whether it's for use for a
 
03:05:51.830 --> 03:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
capital reserve fund to plan for a new
 
03:05:54.050 --> 03:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
building whether it's for use for major
 
03:05:54.060 --> 03:05:56.570 align:start position:0%
building whether it's for use for major
Renovations

03:05:56.570 --> 03:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
Renovations
 
03:05:59.330 --> 03:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
um major repairs right the the roof fell
 
03:06:01.990 --> 03:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
in we need to do something
 
03:06:05.389 --> 03:06:05.399 align:start position:0%
for temporary rented classrooms for for
 
03:06:07.969 --> 03:06:07.979 align:start position:0%
lease space for rented space right this
 
03:06:10.969 --> 03:06:10.979 align:start position:0%
would not be used for keeping the the
 
03:06:14.210 --> 03:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
grounds taken care of and
 
03:06:17.330 --> 03:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
um doing the regular HVAC maintenance of
 
03:06:19.130 --> 03:06:19.140 align:start position:0%
replacing filters that's not what the
 
03:06:21.110 --> 03:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
intent would be the intent would be
 
03:06:23.570 --> 03:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
capital reserve level funding for the
 
03:06:26.330 --> 03:06:26.340 align:start position:0%
different schools that they could use
 
03:06:28.130 --> 03:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
long term and how they would use it
 
03:06:29.990 --> 03:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
would be either hey we're going we need
 
03:06:32.030 --> 03:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
three mobile classrooms in here we have
 
03:06:33.950 --> 03:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
a peak going through this Elementary
 
03:06:36.530 --> 03:06:36.540 align:start position:0%
School and we see that we're going to
 
03:06:39.710 --> 03:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
have a need for an extra 35 students for
 
03:06:41.450 --> 03:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
the next couple of years but then it
 
03:06:44.450 --> 03:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
goes away our population has that bubble
 
03:06:46.130 --> 03:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
running through that and because our
 
03:06:47.690 --> 03:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
school can't handle that bubble this
 
03:06:50.690 --> 03:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
year we need to to deal with that with
 
03:06:52.130 --> 03:06:52.140 align:start position:0%
mobile classrooms
 
03:06:54.410 --> 03:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
by allowing it to follow the child at
 
03:06:57.349 --> 03:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
some level and to be allocated uniformly
 
03:07:00.769 --> 03:07:00.779 align:start position:0%
you would get a chance to um
 
03:07:03.290 --> 03:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
start making sure schools can budget for
 
03:07:04.730 --> 03:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
this and it would encourage better
 
03:07:07.010 --> 03:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
behavior in terms of planning long term
 
03:07:08.450 --> 03:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
they know that they're going to have
 
03:07:10.190 --> 03:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
this much money available to do capital
 
03:07:13.190 --> 03:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
reserve level projects so I'm willing to
 
03:07:14.630 --> 03:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
draft up an amendment the bill that
 
03:07:16.670 --> 03:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
looked like the most applicable one
 
03:07:18.469 --> 03:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
would be 332 but there might be another
 
03:07:20.150 --> 03:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
bill that's coming through relative to
 
03:07:22.550 --> 03:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
education building Aid that might be the
 
03:07:24.110 --> 03:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
right vehicle to have this discussion
 
03:07:25.610 --> 03:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
and I'll go get a formal Amendment
 
03:07:28.130 --> 03:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
drafted for that I just wanted to
 
03:07:30.170 --> 03:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
introduce the topic because I think
 
03:07:33.050 --> 03:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
there is a way to better use the money
 
03:07:35.570 --> 03:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily end up with the
 
03:07:37.190 --> 03:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
winners and losers that we do every year
 
03:07:39.830 --> 03:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
the problem is everybody puts in these
 
03:07:41.510 --> 03:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
huge grants and these applications that
 
03:07:43.550 --> 03:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
are hundreds of pages thick and then the
 
03:07:44.750 --> 03:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
voters don't know whether they're going
 
03:07:46.130 --> 03:07:46.140 align:start position:0%
to get it or not when they go to the
 
03:07:48.590 --> 03:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
town meetings the system is fraught with
 
03:07:48.600 --> 03:07:49.730 align:start position:0%
town meetings the system is fraught with
problems

03:07:49.730 --> 03:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
problems
 
03:07:51.349 --> 03:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
where if they knew that they were going
 
03:07:53.570 --> 03:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
to get X dollars per child to use for
 
03:07:55.790 --> 03:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
childhood space or for classroom space
 
03:07:57.769 --> 03:07:57.779 align:start position:0%
they could plan on it and budget around
 
03:08:00.050 --> 03:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
it and empower the local school boards
 
03:08:03.230 --> 03:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing so that's the the
 
03:08:06.050 --> 03:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
the quote sales pitch unquote on the
 
03:08:08.210 --> 03:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
idea and the discussion I'm willing to
 
03:08:09.830 --> 03:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
draft work on drafting an amendment to
 
03:08:12.410 --> 03:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
this committee I just need some some
 
03:08:14.150 --> 03:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
Bill that makes sense to do something
 
03:08:17.510 --> 03:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
like this very Senate flag
 
03:08:22.490 --> 03:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:24.469 --> 03:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
just came in the last part of this
 
03:08:24.479 --> 03:08:27.050 align:start position:0%
just came in the last part of this
discussion

03:08:27.050 --> 03:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:31.190 --> 03:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
two is a Bill dealing with the
 
03:08:33.410 --> 03:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
application process for school building
 
03:08:36.830 --> 03:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
Aid and it goes from A to Z which has
 
03:08:38.510 --> 03:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
been cracked very closely with
 
03:08:41.769 --> 03:08:41.779 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
03:08:44.450 --> 03:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
so this is a different idea it's a
 
03:08:46.429 --> 03:08:46.439 align:start position:0%
different idea okay
 
03:08:48.410 --> 03:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
all right could I ask a question please
 
03:08:48.420 --> 03:08:49.550 align:start position:0%
all right could I ask a question please
sure

03:08:49.550 --> 03:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:08:50.990 --> 03:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair
 
03:08:52.910 --> 03:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
03:08:56.210 --> 03:08:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:58.490 --> 03:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
um just let me rephrase what I think I
 
03:09:01.190 --> 03:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
heard you said absolutely sure so what I
 
03:09:05.090 --> 03:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
believe I heard you say was that um the
 
03:09:06.950 --> 03:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
intent of the amendment that you are
 
03:09:09.889 --> 03:09:09.899 align:start position:0%
going to prepare is to eliminate
 
03:09:13.190 --> 03:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
building Aid as we know it now and
 
03:09:13.200 --> 03:09:14.870 align:start position:0%
building Aid as we know it now and
instead

03:09:14.870 --> 03:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
instead
 
03:09:19.849 --> 03:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
using the adequacy per child process you
 
03:09:21.530 --> 03:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
would assign
 
03:09:23.929 --> 03:09:23.939 align:start position:0%
um four hundred dollars to K through 8
 
03:09:26.990 --> 03:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
and 500 for high school students
 
03:09:32.030 --> 03:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis is that so yes very
 
03:09:34.490 --> 03:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
very close so I think the number was 450
 
03:09:37.370 --> 03:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
K through 8 and 500 for
 
03:09:39.530 --> 03:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
um high school and it wouldn't be just
 
03:09:41.570 --> 03:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
adequacy it would be a separate program
 
03:09:43.910 --> 03:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
running in parallel much handled much
 
03:09:46.550 --> 03:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
like adequacy is today but it would be
 
03:09:46.560 --> 03:09:48.550 align:start position:0%
like adequacy is today but it would be
some

03:09:48.550 --> 03:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:09:51.710 --> 03:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
facility payment Reserve payment or I'm
 
03:09:53.150 --> 03:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
not sure what the proper term another
 
03:09:55.010 --> 03:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
one of the little boxes it would be a
 
03:09:57.410 --> 03:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
little box but it's uniform across the
 
03:09:59.750 --> 03:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
state it's per child to make sure that
 
03:10:01.969 --> 03:10:01.979 align:start position:0%
there's there's room for classroom space
 
03:10:03.950 --> 03:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
we all know that someone needs to have a
 
03:10:06.530 --> 03:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
place to learn right although I mean you
 
03:10:07.910 --> 03:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
theoretically could learn at the town
 
03:10:09.950 --> 03:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
library if you're homeschooling there is
 
03:10:12.349 --> 03:10:12.359 align:start position:0%
some facility payment necessary and some
 
03:10:14.570 --> 03:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
of this is for maybe it's an expansion
 
03:10:16.429 --> 03:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a roof renovation to keep the
 
03:10:18.410 --> 03:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
facility running or maybe it's putting
 
03:10:19.790 --> 03:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
it in the capital reserve fund to plan
 
03:10:21.110 --> 03:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
for the building because we know we're
 
03:10:23.030 --> 03:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
gonna have to do something about it we
 
03:10:24.830 --> 03:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
see a bump in population because our
 
03:10:27.650 --> 03:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
town is growing a follow-up please so
 
03:10:33.110 --> 03:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:35.630 --> 03:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
adequacy dollars for example the
 
03:10:39.130 --> 03:10:39.140 align:start position:0%
educating Freedom accounts um
 
03:10:41.690 --> 03:10:41.700 align:start position:0%
where they would get this too I'm
 
03:10:44.450 --> 03:10:44.460 align:start position:0%
presuming I don't know if it would
 
03:10:46.610 --> 03:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
um that that's up to this committee or
 
03:10:48.130 --> 03:10:48.140 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee right
 
03:10:51.530 --> 03:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
no I see this I I currently see this for
 
03:10:52.849 --> 03:10:52.859 align:start position:0%
the public school and charter school
 
03:10:54.469 --> 03:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
students right this this is for the
 
03:10:57.349 --> 03:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
buildings right as opposed to for The
 
03:10:59.210 --> 03:10:59.220 align:start position:0%
Homeschool students right I but then
 
03:11:01.370 --> 03:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
again personally I'm I'm wired so
 
03:11:03.530 --> 03:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
although we might have been eligible for
 
03:11:06.650 --> 03:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
at least one year during the various
 
03:11:09.290 --> 03:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
um education Freedom savings account
 
03:11:11.870 --> 03:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
type stuff we didn't participate right
 
03:11:15.170 --> 03:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
we would we funded our own so I see this
 
03:11:17.870 --> 03:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
more for the 161 000 students that are
 
03:11:20.330 --> 03:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
currently in the public school system
 
03:11:20.340 --> 03:11:21.410 align:start position:0%
currently in the public school system
nope

03:11:21.410 --> 03:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
nope
 
03:11:24.050 --> 03:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
thank you nice seeing you Jr
 
03:11:26.690 --> 03:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
uh representative jails
 
03:11:28.550 --> 03:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
um who would be the agents to expend in
 
03:11:31.250 --> 03:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
this special fund and and and answer
 
03:11:33.170 --> 03:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
that question and I got a follow-up okay
 
03:11:35.510 --> 03:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
so I don't know whether it would be
 
03:11:38.330 --> 03:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
overseen by the doe it's not real clear
 
03:11:40.910 --> 03:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
how we would do this or or potentially
 
03:11:44.450 --> 03:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
dra or Das in terms of write somebody to
 
03:11:46.429 --> 03:11:46.439 align:start position:0%
administer it I think we would want to
 
03:11:49.070 --> 03:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
have a fund created that's some sort of
 
03:11:52.490 --> 03:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
capital fund and then we transfer the
 
03:11:54.889 --> 03:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
payments from there to the local towns
 
03:11:57.590 --> 03:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
when they have a capital need and the
 
03:11:59.330 --> 03:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
capital need could be as simple as the
 
03:12:01.910 --> 03:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
school board says hey we want to just
 
03:12:03.769 --> 03:12:03.779 align:start position:0%
um we want 100 of the funds eligible to
 
03:12:05.330 --> 03:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
us to come to our capital reserve
 
03:12:06.769 --> 03:12:06.779 align:start position:0%
account we've had a capital reserve
 
03:12:08.570 --> 03:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
account for years we want to continue to
 
03:12:10.070 --> 03:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
grow it that's where it goes boom it's
 
03:12:13.429 --> 03:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
done it might be another school saying
 
03:12:15.830 --> 03:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have a capital reserve fund but
 
03:12:18.170 --> 03:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
we just had a major leak to the roof it
 
03:12:21.469 --> 03:12:21.479 align:start position:0%
was unanticipated and I now have a 75
 
03:12:22.969 --> 03:12:22.979 align:start position:0%
000 repair that I've got to start
 
03:12:25.250 --> 03:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
thinking about we want to apply to that
 
03:12:28.429 --> 03:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
right and follow-up to that uh I'm on
 
03:12:30.050 --> 03:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
the trustee the trust funds in my town
 
03:12:31.849 --> 03:12:31.859 align:start position:0%
and I oversee the capital reserve
 
03:12:33.710 --> 03:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
accounts which we have one for the
 
03:12:36.710 --> 03:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
school for building Aid of building you
 
03:12:38.690 --> 03:12:38.700 align:start position:0%
know building grounds I believe we call
 
03:12:42.710 --> 03:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
it and what we do we put maybe twenty
 
03:12:44.330 --> 03:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year and we we just
 
03:12:46.190 --> 03:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
went through that whole process and put
 
03:12:48.230 --> 03:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
on two new roofs on our two of our
 
03:12:50.389 --> 03:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
buildings and you know and it's worked
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
out great it's not such an impact to the
 
03:12:55.309 --> 03:12:55.319 align:start position:0%
but we have to think about who that
 
03:12:58.610 --> 03:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
agents to expend is and so it's not done
 
03:13:00.710 --> 03:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
frivolously matter of fact I think we
 
03:13:02.150 --> 03:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
have one bill at two and a half percent
 
03:13:04.790 --> 03:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
if you remember you know that the the
 
03:13:06.950 --> 03:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
districts can hold back yep you know I
 
03:13:09.950 --> 03:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
remember that okay so maybe on the lines
 
03:13:11.570 --> 03:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
you know you can spend these are the
 
03:13:13.190 --> 03:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
some of the items that you can spend it
 
03:13:16.309 --> 03:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
for what I was trying to avoid is this
 
03:13:19.330 --> 03:13:19.340 align:start position:0%
just ends up at the school board level
 
03:13:22.670 --> 03:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
and offsets the total budget because it
 
03:13:24.590 --> 03:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
gets pushed into the the annual
 
03:13:27.530 --> 03:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
facilities so capital reserve accounts
 
03:13:28.790 --> 03:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
are a great place to push the money to
 
03:13:30.830 --> 03:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
because that that's managed slightly
 
03:13:32.570 --> 03:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
differently than putting into the
 
03:13:34.190 --> 03:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
operating budget that handles the
 
03:13:36.530 --> 03:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
landscaping and in the routine
 
03:13:38.269 --> 03:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the building right well
 
03:13:40.849 --> 03:13:40.859 align:start position:0%
some with if I may follow up on that
 
03:13:44.330 --> 03:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
some of the funds are the legislative
 
03:13:46.670 --> 03:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
body in other words the the on a Town
 
03:13:49.429 --> 03:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
warrant or a school district warrant yep
 
03:13:51.650 --> 03:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
and have it so it can be released that
 
03:13:53.690 --> 03:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
way of course you might have emergency
 
03:13:55.910 --> 03:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
which then maybe you have to hold the
 
03:13:57.170 --> 03:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
03:13:59.269 --> 03:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
you know to to be able to expend the
 
03:14:01.010 --> 03:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
funds which sometimes that's too easy
 
03:14:02.570 --> 03:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
because nobody shows up to public
 
03:14:05.210 --> 03:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
hearing even though it's 18 millions of
 
03:14:07.910 --> 03:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
dollars in both cases though whether
 
03:14:09.530 --> 03:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
it's done in a town meeting or done
 
03:14:10.910 --> 03:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
through an emergency school board
 
03:14:13.490 --> 03:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
meeting right if you're truly talking
 
03:14:15.590 --> 03:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
about making sure that the facility is
 
03:14:17.210 --> 03:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
being taken care of to allow the
 
03:14:19.550 --> 03:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
education to take place then then you're
 
03:14:22.670 --> 03:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
serving the needs without the current
 
03:14:24.889 --> 03:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
system of picking winners and losers
 
03:14:27.650 --> 03:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
right the problem with today's system is
 
03:14:29.630 --> 03:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to be the the lottery
 
03:14:31.670 --> 03:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
winner by putting together this great
 
03:14:33.590 --> 03:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
application and then at the end of the
 
03:14:35.269 --> 03:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
day they have expended lots of time and
 
03:14:37.010 --> 03:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
resources and Engineering hours and
 
03:14:38.750 --> 03:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
architect hours to put together this
 
03:14:38.760 --> 03:14:40.309 align:start position:0%
architect hours to put together this
this

03:14:40.309 --> 03:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:14:43.070 --> 03:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
maybe small six-page proposal in terms
 
03:14:44.809 --> 03:14:44.819 align:start position:0%
of the executive summary but hundreds of
 
03:14:46.429 --> 03:14:46.439 align:start position:0%
pages worth of additional documentation
 
03:14:48.889 --> 03:14:48.899 align:start position:0%
and then they don't get it and now what
 
03:14:50.809 --> 03:14:50.819 align:start position:0%
do they do the voters are in this
 
03:14:53.690 --> 03:14:53.700 align:start position:0%
quandary so I was looking at on the list
 
03:14:55.610 --> 03:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
of proposed building AIDS
 
03:14:58.010 --> 03:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
um lines four and five Concord is next
 
03:15:00.710 --> 03:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
in line they want 176 Million Dollar
 
03:15:04.090 --> 03:15:04.100 align:start position:0%
middle school for 900 students
 
03:15:07.309 --> 03:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
and their ask is 70 million dollars
 
03:15:08.510 --> 03:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
worth of building eight and then
 
03:15:09.889 --> 03:15:09.899 align:start position:0%
Litchfield is right behind that
 
03:15:11.990 --> 03:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
Litchfield wants to build a school
 
03:15:14.450 --> 03:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
roughly half the size for 32 million
 
03:15:17.630 --> 03:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
dollars which is a much lower cost per
 
03:15:19.429 --> 03:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
student the smaller School building as
 
03:15:22.730 --> 03:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
well one was 212 000 square feet one was
 
03:15:22.740 --> 03:15:24.650 align:start position:0%
well one was 212 000 square feet one was
86

03:15:24.650 --> 03:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
86
 
03:15:26.389 --> 03:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
000 square feet so roughly a third the
 
03:15:29.150 --> 03:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
size for a population that's about half
 
03:15:32.510 --> 03:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
as big and then they're only asking for
 
03:15:35.150 --> 03:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars so how does the state
 
03:15:37.490 --> 03:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
start reviewing these yes there's a long
 
03:15:39.410 --> 03:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
review process but I'm not sure it
 
03:15:41.269 --> 03:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
serves the citizens well for the entire
 
03:15:43.429 --> 03:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
state it would be better off if we
 
03:15:45.889 --> 03:15:45.899 align:start position:0%
started funding and said you can plan on
 
03:15:47.389 --> 03:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
this money coming into some capital
 
03:15:49.550 --> 03:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
reserve account you guys be good
 
03:15:51.429 --> 03:15:51.439 align:start position:0%
stewards at the local level of how you
 
03:15:53.769 --> 03:15:53.779 align:start position:0%
administer these accounts
 
03:15:57.230 --> 03:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:15:59.570 --> 03:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
to your point earlier capital reserve
 
03:16:00.830 --> 03:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
accounts are managed differently in
 
03:16:03.050 --> 03:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
within different towns
 
03:16:05.750 --> 03:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
um we in Dunbarton every year we put
 
03:16:07.910 --> 03:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
money in the capital reserve account and
 
03:16:09.830 --> 03:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
and that has covered the major roof
 
03:16:12.590 --> 03:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
repairs and the redo of the HVAC system
 
03:16:15.550 --> 03:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
to to better equipped it to handle right
 
03:16:18.110 --> 03:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
overall Heating and and started to chip
 
03:16:19.849 --> 03:16:19.859 align:start position:0%
away at the cost when we needed to add
 
03:16:21.590 --> 03:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
four additional classrooms
 
03:16:24.050 --> 03:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
03:16:26.570 --> 03:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
this encourages towns to be wise with
 
03:16:28.490 --> 03:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
how they spend their money to manage
 
03:16:30.650 --> 03:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
their infrastructure so that they can
 
03:16:32.330 --> 03:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
educate the children and that isn't that
 
03:16:33.710 --> 03:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
the purpose of building Aid in the
 
03:16:35.809 --> 03:16:35.819 align:start position:0%
broadest possible sense as opposed to
 
03:16:37.969 --> 03:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
the current system of I got the lucky
 
03:16:40.030 --> 03:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
architect who wrote the better proposal
 
03:16:42.710 --> 03:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
who managed to get us to the top of the
 
03:16:44.870 --> 03:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
list and we don't need the grant writers
 
03:16:46.070 --> 03:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
and we don't need a lot of the other
 
03:16:47.570 --> 03:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
things that go along
 
03:16:49.670 --> 03:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
if the town knew in March that they were
 
03:16:51.530 --> 03:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
going to get
 
03:16:51.540 --> 03:16:52.610 align:start position:0%
going to get
um

03:16:52.610 --> 03:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:54.590 --> 03:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
let's say a hundred thousand dollars in
 
03:16:56.990 --> 03:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
in aid from the state on for their
 
03:16:59.809 --> 03:16:59.819 align:start position:0%
budget then they could plan for that and
 
03:17:01.490 --> 03:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
put it in the capital reserve and write
 
03:17:04.370 --> 03:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
the warrant articles so it's it's a
 
03:17:06.769 --> 03:17:06.779 align:start position:0%
long-term thing to change how we do this
 
03:17:08.870 --> 03:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
but I think it would be better it would
 
03:17:11.210 --> 03:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
help towns better manage their schools
 
03:17:13.010 --> 03:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
they could figure out whether they want
 
03:17:15.290 --> 03:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
to put money toward repairing something
 
03:17:17.150 --> 03:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
or planning for an addition or building
 
03:17:21.769 --> 03:17:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:24.170 --> 03:17:24.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:17:25.670 --> 03:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
03:17:29.090 --> 03:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
um you are suggesting a you know forward
 
03:17:32.150 --> 03:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
change that would be you know maybe
 
03:17:34.910 --> 03:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
better in the long term right but that
 
03:17:36.769 --> 03:17:36.779 align:start position:0%
still leaves us with you know an
 
03:17:39.110 --> 03:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
existing backlog of projects and people
 
03:17:40.910 --> 03:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
who have gone through the application
 
03:17:43.790 --> 03:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
process and whatnot what are your
 
03:17:45.710 --> 03:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
thoughts in terms of just transitioning
 
03:17:47.570 --> 03:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
assuming that this is the direction we
 
03:17:50.510 --> 03:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
want to go into long term but how do we
 
03:17:53.570 --> 03:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
handle the current you know so there is
 
03:17:55.849 --> 03:17:55.859 align:start position:0%
a backlog and I don't have the numbers
 
03:17:57.590 --> 03:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
in front of me but I wanted to say it
 
03:17:59.750 --> 03:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
was north of 200 million dollars or some
 
03:18:03.050 --> 03:18:03.060 align:start position:0%
yeah worth of requests from the state
 
03:18:05.750 --> 03:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
one one only one school of which was
 
03:18:07.429 --> 03:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
which was close to a third of that total
 
03:18:07.439 --> 03:18:09.230 align:start position:0%
which was close to a third of that total
amount

03:18:09.230 --> 03:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
amount
 
03:18:10.969 --> 03:18:10.979 align:start position:0%
um what about the schools that didn't
 
03:18:14.150 --> 03:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
make the lists right they so so
 
03:18:15.830 --> 03:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that there are
 
03:18:17.389 --> 03:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
facilities for all the children within
 
03:18:20.510 --> 03:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
the state and the best way to do that is
 
03:18:22.429 --> 03:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
to encourage local school boards to be
 
03:18:23.870 --> 03:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
wise about how they spend their money
 
03:18:28.070 --> 03:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's Elise right maybe it's a
 
03:18:30.469 --> 03:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
maybe it's some mobile classrooms right
 
03:18:32.809 --> 03:18:32.819 align:start position:0%
not a fan of mobile classrooms I get it
 
03:18:34.849 --> 03:18:34.859 align:start position:0%
they're they're less than ideal places
 
03:18:39.469 --> 03:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
to to educate but maybe it's it's that a
 
03:18:40.910 --> 03:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
mobile classroom is the right solution
 
03:18:42.530 --> 03:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
because they know that their population
 
03:18:45.469 --> 03:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
is pretty level and they have a bubble
 
03:18:48.469 --> 03:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
just because of who moved into town
 
03:18:51.769 --> 03:18:51.779 align:start position:0%
several years ago so I would like to
 
03:18:53.510 --> 03:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
encourage local school boards to be very
 
03:18:55.010 --> 03:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
efficient in how they use their money
 
03:18:56.929 --> 03:18:56.939 align:start position:0%
and to be why stewards of the buildings
 
03:18:59.030 --> 03:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
that they have and this helps them make
 
03:19:00.590 --> 03:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
those decisions if they know that this
 
03:19:02.990 --> 03:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
money's coming as opposed to I wrote a
 
03:19:06.830 --> 03:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
grant I waited a year plus 18 months in
 
03:19:09.590 --> 03:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
other cases before I knew and how does
 
03:19:11.750 --> 03:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
the town plan for that which which
 
03:19:13.550 --> 03:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
particular budget meeting are you going
 
03:19:15.410 --> 03:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
to bring this up you start the proposal
 
03:19:17.570 --> 03:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
but you have no idea when the voters
 
03:19:19.130 --> 03:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
come in March they may not even know
 
03:19:21.290 --> 03:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
that they're gonna this is going to come
 
03:19:22.730 --> 03:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
to fruition because it's tied to
 
03:19:24.710 --> 03:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
legislation at some level or it could
 
03:19:28.670 --> 03:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
change the system's broken so the way to
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
fix a broken system in some cases is to
 
03:19:33.290 --> 03:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
not try and repair and vanity the system
 
03:19:35.330 --> 03:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
anymore it's to go forward with
 
03:19:37.250 --> 03:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
something that would be a prudent way to
 
03:19:39.650 --> 03:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
fund the space that people need long
 
03:19:39.660 --> 03:19:40.610 align:start position:0%
fund the space that people need long
term

03:19:40.610 --> 03:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
term
 
03:19:42.830 --> 03:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:19:45.110 --> 03:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
well I I can't answer your question
 
03:19:48.050 --> 03:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
right now about which which of the many
 
03:19:50.750 --> 03:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
we have but I would recommend House Bill
 
03:19:52.670 --> 03:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
too so the 75 million dollar
 
03:19:54.290 --> 03:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
appropriation will be in House Bill too
 
03:19:56.750 --> 03:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
it could go into thank you uh I was
 
03:19:56.760 --> 03:19:58.030 align:start position:0%
it could go into thank you uh I was
thinking

03:19:58.030 --> 03:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
03:20:01.130 --> 03:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
I said I wouldn't recommend a specific
 
03:20:03.170 --> 03:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
bill because these are going to end up
 
03:20:07.309 --> 03:20:07.319 align:start position:0%
in hb2 okay my thought was of the bills
 
03:20:09.590 --> 03:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
that I saw 332 was the one that I was
 
03:20:11.630 --> 03:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
going to if you guys wanted to exec that
 
03:20:13.790 --> 03:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
one out I was going to draft the
 
03:20:16.670 --> 03:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to 332. it was germane to the
 
03:20:20.450 --> 03:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
bill it's a it's a complete replace but
 
03:20:22.550 --> 03:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
um but we could just add we can put it
 
03:20:24.290 --> 03:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
in hb2 I get it for the purpose of
 
03:20:26.929 --> 03:20:26.939 align:start position:0%
having a conversation right it's a
 
03:20:29.090 --> 03:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
paradigm shift and Paradigm shifts take
 
03:20:31.429 --> 03:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
time for people to understand it's not
 
03:20:33.590 --> 03:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
easy to just say well but it's always
 
03:20:35.269 --> 03:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
worked this way well it hasn't always
 
03:20:36.889 --> 03:20:36.899 align:start position:0%
worked this way how many schools are
 
03:20:39.170 --> 03:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
still on the waiting list for 16 schools
 
03:20:40.790 --> 03:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
still on the waiting list trying to to
 
03:20:42.889 --> 03:20:42.899 align:start position:0%
do new buildings
 
03:20:44.330 --> 03:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
um and then we end up with these
 
03:20:45.830 --> 03:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
projects that are Ultra expensive
 
03:20:47.150 --> 03:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
because they're going to get some free
 
03:20:48.650 --> 03:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
money from the state
 
03:20:51.530 --> 03:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
yes I just want to talk a little bit
 
03:20:53.510 --> 03:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
about building Aid
 
03:20:55.969 --> 03:20:55.979 align:start position:0%
um building Aid has been in place for a
 
03:20:57.830 --> 03:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
long time but we also had a 10-year
 
03:21:00.110 --> 03:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
moratorium we did not have any building
 
03:21:01.969 --> 03:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
aid for 10 years because we have the
 
03:21:04.670 --> 03:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
tail and we have to pay up the tail
 
03:21:08.330 --> 03:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
um there is a very
 
03:21:11.690 --> 03:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
thorough process that the department of
 
03:21:14.929 --> 03:21:14.939 align:start position:0%
Ed goes through in terms of of building
 
03:21:17.870 --> 03:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
Aid a building the life of a building
 
03:21:21.230 --> 03:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
should be 40 years and we probably have
 
03:21:23.929 --> 03:21:23.939 align:start position:0%
500 school buildings in the state of New
 
03:21:23.939 --> 03:21:25.250 align:start position:0%
500 school buildings in the state of New
Hampshire

03:21:25.250 --> 03:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:21:27.050 --> 03:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
um and some have gone through building
 
03:21:29.450 --> 03:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
Aid usually
 
03:21:32.030 --> 03:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
in the normal practice
 
03:21:35.330 --> 03:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
there was a process where a town would
 
03:21:38.570 --> 03:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
work on passing a bond and then they'd
 
03:21:40.429 --> 03:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
get their building Aid
 
03:21:43.010 --> 03:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
um and the moratorium halted that so
 
03:21:45.230 --> 03:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
that has created a problem now
 
03:21:48.650 --> 03:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
we had a moratorium for 10 years now we
 
03:21:51.590 --> 03:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
are flush with cash right now we as I
 
03:21:54.050 --> 03:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
said earlier we are blessed in New
 
03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have so many much funding
 
03:21:57.950 --> 03:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
and we've never had a surplus in the
 
03:22:00.410 --> 03:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
education trust before to this extent
 
03:22:03.769 --> 03:22:03.779 align:start position:0%
right so my fear is
 
03:22:06.590 --> 03:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden you're proposing a new
 
03:22:06.600 --> 03:22:09.410 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden you're proposing a new
methodology

03:22:09.410 --> 03:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
methodology
 
03:22:11.870 --> 03:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
it really hasn't been vetted
 
03:22:14.630 --> 03:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
um hasn't really been heard from the
 
03:22:14.640 --> 03:22:16.190 align:start position:0%
um hasn't really been heard from the
public

03:22:16.190 --> 03:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:22:18.050 --> 03:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
um we haven't I mean we're talking about
 
03:22:20.510 --> 03:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
it right now but I just get a little bit
 
03:22:22.070 --> 03:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
nervous when I start thinking about
 
03:22:25.010 --> 03:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
putting something of this magnitude into
 
03:22:25.020 --> 03:22:27.110 align:start position:0%
putting something of this magnitude into
hb2

03:22:27.110 --> 03:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
03:22:30.410 --> 03:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
um without having some kind of a public
 
03:22:30.420 --> 03:22:31.910 align:start position:0%
um without having some kind of a public
response

03:22:31.910 --> 03:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
response
 
03:22:34.250 --> 03:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
some kind of a public hearing
 
03:22:36.710 --> 03:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
because we have not had that you are
 
03:22:39.769 --> 03:22:39.779 align:start position:0%
bringing up now earlier in this day
 
03:22:41.150 --> 03:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner of Education was
 
03:22:43.790 --> 03:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
here and he had a very similar proposal
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
to what you were talking about
 
03:22:49.250 --> 03:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
um in that money would be put in with
 
03:22:51.950 --> 03:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
the treasurer and it would be held
 
03:22:54.889 --> 03:22:54.899 align:start position:0%
um in an account and then districts
 
03:22:56.389 --> 03:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
could kind of draw down on I think
 
03:22:58.910 --> 03:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what his okay it was very
 
03:23:00.469 --> 03:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
similar to what you're proposing
 
03:23:00.479 --> 03:23:01.730 align:start position:0%
similar to what you're proposing
actually

03:23:01.730 --> 03:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:23:03.950 --> 03:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
um so this is just it's such a new way
 
03:23:06.410 --> 03:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
of thinking about something wouldn't it
 
03:23:08.690 --> 03:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
be better to go through a different
 
03:23:13.070 --> 03:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
process and get some public feedback
 
03:23:15.530 --> 03:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
it's a great point and and maybe the
 
03:23:18.170 --> 03:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
right thing to do is call it an a
 
03:23:19.370 --> 03:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
non-germain I'll put it in quotes
 
03:23:21.950 --> 03:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
non-germaine amendment to HB 332 bring
 
03:23:24.050 --> 03:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
it back up for a meeting schedule it in
 
03:23:25.969 --> 03:23:25.979 align:start position:0%
the calendar have a meeting on it so
 
03:23:28.309 --> 03:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
that everybody's notified
 
03:23:28.319 --> 03:23:29.469 align:start position:0%
that everybody's notified
uh

03:23:29.469 --> 03:23:29.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:23:31.490 --> 03:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton and I'm going to use our local
 
03:23:33.410 --> 03:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
town has historically been very good
 
03:23:35.570 --> 03:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
about budgeting right
 
03:23:38.210 --> 03:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
um and with the minor
 
03:23:41.929 --> 03:23:41.939 align:start position:0%
um minor Financial Accounting
 
03:23:41.939 --> 03:23:43.269 align:start position:0%
um minor Financial Accounting
um

03:23:43.269 --> 03:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:46.870 --> 03:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
error that was when we were part of
 
03:23:49.610 --> 03:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
gosstown along with
 
03:23:51.590 --> 03:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
um what wasn't new it wasn't New Boston
 
03:23:53.690 --> 03:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
right other than that accounting era
 
03:23:55.670 --> 03:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
that racked up 14 million dollars in
 
03:23:56.990 --> 03:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
excess funds that should have been
 
03:23:59.690 --> 03:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
returned and what to do with those we've
 
03:24:01.429 --> 03:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
been really prudent about how money has
 
03:24:03.950 --> 03:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
been spent locally and it's it's worked
 
03:24:05.929 --> 03:24:05.939 align:start position:0%
right the the town plans for these
 
03:24:07.729 --> 03:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
things we plan for our roads we've been
 
03:24:09.769 --> 03:24:09.779 align:start position:0%
budgeting money every year in terms of
 
03:24:10.969 --> 03:24:10.979 align:start position:0%
capital we put a hundred thousand
 
03:24:12.290 --> 03:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
dollars every year into the capital
 
03:24:14.150 --> 03:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
reserve to help keep the roads going and
 
03:24:14.160 --> 03:24:16.010 align:start position:0%
reserve to help keep the roads going and
whatever

03:24:16.010 --> 03:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:24:17.870 --> 03:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
I do the same thing personally I think
 
03:24:19.610 --> 03:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
about the car right I'm going to have to
 
03:24:21.050 --> 03:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
buy a car at some point I like buying
 
03:24:22.309 --> 03:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
cars and cash it makes it the
 
03:24:24.170 --> 03:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
negotiations a whole lot easier
 
03:24:26.510 --> 03:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
and when you do that you can go into the
 
03:24:27.769 --> 03:24:27.779 align:start position:0%
dealer and say this is what I want to
 
03:24:30.290 --> 03:24:30.300 align:start position:0%
pay here's the check and when you start
 
03:24:32.330 --> 03:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
walking out about 10 steps outside the
 
03:24:33.830 --> 03:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
front door they tend to call you back in
 
03:24:35.570 --> 03:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
and say I'll sell you the car
 
03:24:37.550 --> 03:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
because you can you can negotiate a
 
03:24:39.530 --> 03:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
really good price if you're trying to
 
03:24:41.210 --> 03:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
negotiate on the lease terms it's not as
 
03:24:43.790 --> 03:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
good a way to negotiate I think
 
03:24:46.849 --> 03:24:46.859 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we've incentivized how
 
03:24:48.290 --> 03:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
much can you borrow how big a building
 
03:24:50.210 --> 03:24:50.220 align:start position:0%
can you build because we're going to
 
03:24:51.710 --> 03:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
give you 30 percent of this in some
 
03:24:54.290 --> 03:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
cases and sixty percent in others and it
 
03:24:56.809 --> 03:24:56.819 align:start position:0%
encourages behavior that is less than
 
03:24:59.030 --> 03:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
being prudent and prudent stewards of
 
03:25:00.889 --> 03:25:00.899 align:start position:0%
the money I think there's a better way
 
03:25:02.389 --> 03:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
to do this because if they knew they
 
03:25:03.830 --> 03:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
could count on it which is the problem
 
03:25:06.950 --> 03:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
the moratorium created right over the
 
03:25:06.960 --> 03:25:08.269 align:start position:0%
the moratorium created right over the
years

03:25:08.269 --> 03:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:25:10.670 --> 03:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
um and they don't know if they're going
 
03:25:13.130 --> 03:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
to get the money if your number five six
 
03:25:15.469 --> 03:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
seven on the list do you count on it I I
 
03:25:17.510 --> 03:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't know and yes we're flush with cash
 
03:25:19.790 --> 03:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
reserves right now because the
 
03:25:21.410 --> 03:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
businesses have done exceedingly well
 
03:25:23.510 --> 03:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
over the last couple years and and the
 
03:25:24.950 --> 03:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
revenues have come in much higher than
 
03:25:27.050 --> 03:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
predicted we cut the taxes everybody
 
03:25:29.690 --> 03:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
said hey move move Revenue into New
 
03:25:30.950 --> 03:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's a friendly place to do
 
03:25:33.710 --> 03:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
business now and when an accountant in
 
03:25:35.870 --> 03:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
New York says well we can call it in in
 
03:25:37.309 --> 03:25:37.319 align:start position:0%
this division in New Hampshire it's a
 
03:25:38.990 --> 03:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
good place to bring Revenue in guess
 
03:25:41.570 --> 03:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
what it happened in no surprise when you
 
03:25:44.690 --> 03:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
have low tax status people try and move
 
03:25:46.969 --> 03:25:46.979 align:start position:0%
their their company Revenue under those
 
03:25:50.269 --> 03:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
low tax umbrellas so I'm not surprised
 
03:25:52.010 --> 03:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
that we we saw the additional Revenue
 
03:25:53.809 --> 03:25:53.819 align:start position:0%
maybe there needs to be a step
 
03:25:55.969 --> 03:25:55.979 align:start position:0%
transition but I'm I'm looking at this
 
03:25:58.010 --> 03:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
is the long term the right thing to do
 
03:26:00.290 --> 03:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
is to help talents plan well in advance
 
03:26:01.849 --> 03:26:01.859 align:start position:0%
and if they knew that they could count
 
03:26:03.590 --> 03:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
on this they could start putting it into
 
03:26:05.389 --> 03:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
the capital reserve year after year
 
03:26:07.250 --> 03:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
after year and that way when they need
 
03:26:08.929 --> 03:26:08.939 align:start position:0%
to go do a building or put something in
 
03:26:11.030 --> 03:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
place they have the money to do it and
 
03:26:13.729 --> 03:26:13.739 align:start position:0%
in terms of legislation why not have a
 
03:26:15.530 --> 03:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
hearing on this call it a non-germain
 
03:26:17.150 --> 03:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment if we need to we can put it
 
03:26:19.490 --> 03:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
into the calendar for this week and have
 
03:26:21.650 --> 03:26:21.660 align:start position:0%
this discussion so everybody's invited I
 
03:26:24.170 --> 03:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
I have no it's not about trying to hide
 
03:26:26.990 --> 03:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
a different process it's the Paradigm
 
03:26:29.090 --> 03:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
that we have today is broken and when
 
03:26:30.830 --> 03:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
you start talking about a new paradigm
 
03:26:32.389 --> 03:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
it takes a lot of work
 
03:26:34.070 --> 03:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
but I want to I want to have that
 
03:26:35.210 --> 03:26:35.220 align:start position:0%
conversation I want to have that
 
03:26:36.830 --> 03:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
dialogue out in the open because I think
 
03:26:39.110 --> 03:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
long term this could be beneficial to
 
03:26:41.210 --> 03:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
all the students in the state not just
 
03:26:42.950 --> 03:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
the select few that happen to be the
 
03:26:44.809 --> 03:26:44.819 align:start position:0%
winners in the current in the current
 
03:26:48.110 --> 03:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
building aid process I have a suggestion
 
03:26:49.610 --> 03:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
how it might work
 
03:26:52.630 --> 03:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
because the governor has has
 
03:26:55.849 --> 03:26:55.859 align:start position:0%
recommended or budgeted an additional 25
 
03:26:58.250 --> 03:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
million to the 50 that's been kind of
 
03:27:01.130 --> 03:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
like the standard yep and in discussions
 
03:27:02.929 --> 03:27:02.939 align:start position:0%
with prior members of this committee I
 
03:27:04.429 --> 03:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
said where'd the 50 million come from
 
03:27:06.229 --> 03:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
and the answer was well I thought that's
 
03:27:07.910 --> 03:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
what we could get past
 
03:27:10.250 --> 03:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
so I mean it's not like it's a magic
 
03:27:10.260 --> 03:27:11.630 align:start position:0%
so I mean it's not like it's a magic
number

03:27:11.630 --> 03:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
number
 
03:27:13.929 --> 03:27:13.939 align:start position:0%
is to continue the current process
 
03:27:16.370 --> 03:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
budgeted at 50 million
 
03:27:19.130 --> 03:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
take the 25 million and do it on an
 
03:27:21.229 --> 03:27:21.239 align:start position:0%
allocation basis
 
03:27:21.239 --> 03:27:22.729 align:start position:0%
allocation basis
for

03:27:22.729 --> 03:27:22.739 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:27:22.739 --> 03:27:23.870 align:start position:0%
for
two

03:27:23.870 --> 03:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:27:26.210 --> 03:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
I don't know how many cycles I'm just
 
03:27:29.990 --> 03:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
right okay now so the 25 million starts
 
03:27:31.610 --> 03:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
setting up this fund
 
03:27:34.910 --> 03:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
for per student right like building
 
03:27:36.590 --> 03:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
adequacy I mean if we want to create
 
03:27:38.389 --> 03:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
something well it's still it's
 
03:27:39.950 --> 03:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
facilitated it's in the broadest term
 
03:27:43.370 --> 03:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
right you've got 25 million now going to
 
03:27:44.870 --> 03:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
that fund as
 
03:27:46.969 --> 03:27:46.979 align:start position:0%
we continue the same broken system
 
03:27:50.450 --> 03:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
because it's an ugly baby but it's ours
 
03:27:53.269 --> 03:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
right so you know
 
03:27:54.950 --> 03:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's right just to cut it
 
03:27:54.960 --> 03:27:55.670 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's right just to cut it
off

03:27:55.670 --> 03:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
off
 
03:27:57.830 --> 03:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
but if we can transition out of it right
 
03:27:59.929 --> 03:27:59.939 align:start position:0%
with these additional funds it might be
 
03:28:02.929 --> 03:28:02.939 align:start position:0%
a way to do it okay
 
03:28:05.690 --> 03:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
I like the concept how would you defend
 
03:28:08.870 --> 03:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
the figures you've chosen 450 and 500 if
 
03:28:10.849 --> 03:28:10.859 align:start position:0%
somebody challenged you one that's not
 
03:28:12.889 --> 03:28:12.899 align:start position:0%
enough for what good is that or
 
03:28:15.650 --> 03:28:15.660 align:start position:0%
those are great questions I took the 75
 
03:28:17.150 --> 03:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars that had been allocated
 
03:28:19.490 --> 03:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
in hb2 as the round number looked at the
 
03:28:22.429 --> 03:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
170 sorry 161 000 public school students
 
03:28:24.110 --> 03:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
and said that works out the 485 per
 
03:28:26.809 --> 03:28:26.819 align:start position:0%
child we do know we do per year per
 
03:28:30.229 --> 03:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
child we do know that
 
03:28:33.050 --> 03:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
um that it's easier and less costly to
 
03:28:35.090 --> 03:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
build infrastructure for elementary
 
03:28:36.830 --> 03:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
schools than it is middle schools and
 
03:28:38.690 --> 03:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
middle schools is less costly than high
 
03:28:41.809 --> 03:28:41.819 align:start position:0%
schools so I I we didn't have I started
 
03:28:43.190 --> 03:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
asking questions about middle schools
 
03:28:44.750 --> 03:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
there's not a real clear definition of
 
03:28:46.250 --> 03:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
is Middle School seven and eight six
 
03:28:48.469 --> 03:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
seven and AI I was on education for
 
03:28:50.030 --> 03:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
years I don't know what in New Hampshire
 
03:28:52.370 --> 03:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
where we draw that line so we have k
 
03:28:54.349 --> 03:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
through eight in one bucket in high
 
03:28:54.359 --> 03:28:55.670 align:start position:0%
through eight in one bucket in high
school

03:28:55.670 --> 03:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:28:58.849 --> 03:28:58.859 align:start position:0%
um and I just did the math to try and
 
03:29:01.610 --> 03:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
simplify how we get to the 75 million
 
03:29:03.469 --> 03:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
dollars and the math worked out the 76
 
03:29:05.750 --> 03:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
million in terms of reasonable now round
 
03:29:09.110 --> 03:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
numbers so if we took my thought it's
 
03:29:10.790 --> 03:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
one third of this you take one third of
 
03:29:15.590 --> 03:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:20.090 --> 03:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
well thank you I think I I think if you
 
03:29:21.590 --> 03:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
want to put something together more
 
03:29:23.450 --> 03:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
formally because it's going to take some
 
03:29:24.769 --> 03:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
more thought process you've heard our
 
03:29:29.090 --> 03:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
questions sure uh is HP 32 the right
 
03:29:30.530 --> 03:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
bill then that was the one that looked
 
03:29:32.510 --> 03:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
like it was a possible one in terms of a
 
03:29:35.570 --> 03:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
fit on on just straight
 
03:29:35.580 --> 03:29:37.190 align:start position:0%
fit on on just straight
um

03:29:37.190 --> 03:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:39.950 --> 03:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
right it's relative to school building
 
03:29:43.610 --> 03:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
age projects and
 
03:29:45.710 --> 03:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
um this was trying to allocate an extra
 
03:29:47.450 --> 03:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars and right
 
03:29:50.269 --> 03:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
sorry five million dollars per year
 
03:29:50.279 --> 03:29:51.050 align:start position:0%
sorry five million dollars per year
um

03:29:51.050 --> 03:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:53.269 --> 03:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
whether we tack it on to that whether we
 
03:29:55.969 --> 03:29:55.979 align:start position:0%
do a repeal and replace but
 
03:29:57.590 --> 03:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
um that that bill I think was going to
 
03:29:59.809 --> 03:29:59.819 align:start position:0%
be retained by your committee so it has
 
03:30:02.030 --> 03:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
been okay
 
03:30:04.010 --> 03:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know the procedural part of this
 
03:30:07.250 --> 03:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
Nick could you shed some light if the
 
03:30:08.510 --> 03:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
committee was gonna
 
03:30:11.030 --> 03:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
go down the path of changing any sort of
 
03:30:12.950 --> 03:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
aid program or appropriating money I'd
 
03:30:14.809 --> 03:30:14.819 align:start position:0%
say at this point House Bill one and two
 
03:30:16.969 --> 03:30:16.979 align:start position:0%
are your vehicles to do that so while
 
03:30:19.910 --> 03:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 332 is set to be retained
 
03:30:21.410 --> 03:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
that was our initial recommendation on
 
03:30:23.630 --> 03:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
that uh if you're gonna have spending I
 
03:30:24.830 --> 03:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
would say if it's part of your budget
 
03:30:26.210 --> 03:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
package one and two would make the most
 
03:30:28.190 --> 03:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
sense so a house bill two Amendment for
 
03:30:30.290 --> 03:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
this would so do we have to have a
 
03:30:31.910 --> 03:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
special is the right thing to do to have
 
03:30:34.190 --> 03:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
a hearing on it that's a question of the
 
03:30:36.469 --> 03:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
clerk germaneness is pretty broad when
 
03:30:37.790 --> 03:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
it comes to House Bill one and two
 
03:30:39.590 --> 03:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
especially since we already have school
 
03:30:41.809 --> 03:30:41.819 align:start position:0%
building Aid uh included in the budget
 
03:30:43.070 --> 03:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
as well as changes to school building
 
03:30:45.590 --> 03:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
Aid would that Fund in House Bill 2 you
 
03:30:46.790 --> 03:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
may not need
 
03:30:49.370 --> 03:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
the hearing um but let's have a hearing
 
03:30:51.830 --> 03:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
on it I mean the benefit there is right
 
03:30:53.630 --> 03:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
not that I want to have everybody take
 
03:30:55.610 --> 03:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
an extra 20 minutes or half an hour hour
 
03:30:57.469 --> 03:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
but at least in terms of openness and
 
03:30:59.570 --> 03:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
honesty and transparency yeah we can
 
03:31:01.309 --> 03:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
have a hearing yeah
 
03:31:01.319 --> 03:31:02.630 align:start position:0%
have a hearing yeah
sure

03:31:02.630 --> 03:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:31:04.250 --> 03:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
the one thing I'll say is you'll need an
 
03:31:05.690 --> 03:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
amendment drafted before it can be
 
03:31:08.210 --> 03:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
noticed so okay that's going to put us
 
03:31:08.220 --> 03:31:08.990 align:start position:0%
noticed so okay that's going to put us
out

03:31:08.990 --> 03:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:31:12.650 --> 03:31:12.660 align:start position:0%
until the just to put that out there so
 
03:31:14.769 --> 03:31:14.779 align:start position:0%
um since you're having discussions on on
 
03:31:17.210 --> 03:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
education related things do we do a
 
03:31:19.429 --> 03:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
draft amendment to that section of hb2
 
03:31:21.769 --> 03:31:21.779 align:start position:0%
hb2 hasn't even come over yet so it's
 
03:31:23.510 --> 03:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
hard to do an amendment to it something
 
03:31:26.990 --> 03:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen but I'll ask
 
03:31:29.090 --> 03:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
um our our side maybe I can speak with
 
03:31:30.830 --> 03:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
you afterward have you draft up the
 
03:31:34.490 --> 03:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
amendment for this and then I'll present
 
03:31:36.650 --> 03:31:36.660 align:start position:0%
it in a at whenever you can schedule
 
03:31:36.660 --> 03:31:37.849 align:start position:0%
it in a at whenever you can schedule
something

03:31:37.849 --> 03:31:37.859 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:31:42.050 --> 03:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:45.110 --> 03:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:31:47.210 --> 03:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
referring to our workload
 
03:31:51.349 --> 03:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
we're two weeks roughly tomorrow into
 
03:31:54.349 --> 03:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
the six weeks we have and we're two
 
03:31:55.729 --> 03:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
weeks behind
 
03:31:57.710 --> 03:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
we didn't start off with Ways and Means
 
03:32:00.950 --> 03:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
estimate we still haven't got hb2
 
03:32:03.229 --> 03:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to have four weeks left to
 
03:32:05.330 --> 03:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
do all our work so
 
03:32:07.790 --> 03:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
for your chairs and vice chairs
 
03:32:10.550 --> 03:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
plan on five days a week at least
 
03:32:13.190 --> 03:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
and probably later days
 
03:32:14.690 --> 03:32:14.700 align:start position:0%
I don't want to be the bearer of bad
 
03:32:16.729 --> 03:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
news but it's three weeks not four so
 
03:32:18.769 --> 03:32:18.779 align:start position:0%
with three weeks from Thursday is our is
 
03:32:21.170 --> 03:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
our plan drop dead division deadline for
 
03:32:25.190 --> 03:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh decisions the 23rd
 
03:32:28.729 --> 03:32:28.739 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'd just like to take a moment
 
03:32:31.490 --> 03:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
to recognize how truly rushed that feels
 
03:32:34.130 --> 03:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
for a major change in our Educational
 
03:32:37.550 --> 03:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
Funding system so I I would just like to
 
03:32:40.070 --> 03:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
think that if we were to honor this idea
 
03:32:41.929 --> 03:32:41.939 align:start position:0%
and truly vet it for not only the
 
03:32:43.849 --> 03:32:43.859 align:start position:0%
upsides that we're talking about now but
 
03:32:46.550 --> 03:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
potentially vetting these down potential
 
03:32:49.010 --> 03:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
downsides that we haven't even begun to
 
03:32:49.020 --> 03:32:50.330 align:start position:0%
downsides that we haven't even begun to
discover

03:32:50.330 --> 03:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
discover
 
03:32:52.309 --> 03:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
um that three weeks is probably not
 
03:32:54.530 --> 03:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
enough time to to really go through that
 
03:32:55.969 --> 03:32:55.979 align:start position:0%
process and I I would just like to pump
 
03:32:57.830 --> 03:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
the brakes on behalf of the rest of the
 
03:32:59.510 --> 03:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters who are not represented
 
03:33:02.210 --> 03:33:02.220 align:start position:0%
in this room I think I think this may be
 
03:33:04.370 --> 03:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
a rush to a really great idea down the
 
03:33:06.229 --> 03:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
road but I'm feeling like three weeks is
 
03:33:08.510 --> 03:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
not gonna do it justice well part of our
 
03:33:10.550 --> 03:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
retaining these bills is to make
 
03:33:12.650 --> 03:33:12.660 align:start position:0%
recommendations for the next legislative
 
03:33:15.229 --> 03:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
cycle so it's probably a good idea to do
 
03:33:17.090 --> 03:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
this next to legislative cycle if we
 
03:33:20.150 --> 03:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
only got three weeks left I don't
 
03:33:25.090 --> 03:33:25.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:29.030 --> 03:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
and we got 52 bills collectively right
 
03:33:29.040 --> 03:33:43.190 align:start position:0%
and we got 52 bills collectively right
foreign

03:33:43.190 --> 03:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:45.349 --> 03:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
don't mean to interrupt thank you Mr
 
03:33:47.750 --> 03:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
chair we've just come off a 10-year
 
03:33:50.030 --> 03:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
moratorium school districts are
 
03:33:50.040 --> 03:33:51.290 align:start position:0%
moratorium school districts are
scrambling

03:33:51.290 --> 03:33:51.300 align:start position:0%
scrambling
 
03:33:54.950 --> 03:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
um all of a sudden cities were hopeful
 
03:33:57.769 --> 03:33:57.779 align:start position:0%
about moving forward they were beginning
 
03:33:59.450 --> 03:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
to think again that there was going to
 
03:34:02.150 --> 03:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
be more building Aid available and now
 
03:34:05.030 --> 03:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden to do a complete about
 
03:34:07.910 --> 03:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
face to something completely different
 
03:34:10.610 --> 03:34:10.620 align:start position:0%
I mean I just
 
03:34:13.429 --> 03:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
as a former used to be in Dunbarton too
 
03:34:14.929 --> 03:34:14.939 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
03:34:14.939 --> 03:34:15.590 align:start position:0%
by the way
um

03:34:15.590 --> 03:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:18.290 --> 03:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
you know I I just think it's too much to
 
03:34:22.070 --> 03:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
ask of people in this short a window you
 
03:34:24.190 --> 03:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
know I think people need more time to
 
03:34:27.170 --> 03:34:27.180 align:start position:0%
absorb something of this magnitude and
 
03:34:28.790 --> 03:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
really to get some feedback I'd like to
 
03:34:30.950 --> 03:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
hear from the superintendents so from
 
03:34:30.960 --> 03:34:32.150 align:start position:0%
hear from the superintendents so from
education

03:34:32.150 --> 03:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:34:32.160 --> 03:34:33.530 align:start position:0%
education
um

03:34:33.530 --> 03:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:35.929 --> 03:34:35.939 align:start position:0%
I agree you know it's too much too fast
 
03:34:37.670 --> 03:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
too soon
 
03:34:40.670 --> 03:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea thank you next term
 
03:34:43.849 --> 03:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
next term it is interesting
 
03:34:46.010 --> 03:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
just as a quick thought
 
03:34:47.809 --> 03:34:47.819 align:start position:0%
I completely agree with the previous
 
03:34:49.670 --> 03:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
remarks that it's kind of hard to turn
 
03:34:52.070 --> 03:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
this boat in three weeks
 
03:34:52.080 --> 03:34:53.450 align:start position:0%
this boat in three weeks
but

03:34:53.450 --> 03:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:34:56.330 --> 03:34:56.340 align:start position:0%
I am reminded of what somebody was
 
03:34:58.429 --> 03:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
telling me that in preparing for major
 
03:35:00.889 --> 03:35:00.899 align:start position:0%
changes it is good to make a send a
 
03:35:03.050 --> 03:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
clear signal to people that changes are
 
03:35:05.750 --> 03:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
coming so they can start preparing and
 
03:35:07.790 --> 03:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
maybe just retaining a bill with a plan
 
03:35:10.190 --> 03:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
to do something about it next year may
 
03:35:12.889 --> 03:35:12.899 align:start position:0%
not be enough of a signal I just was
 
03:35:14.929 --> 03:35:14.939 align:start position:0%
gonna suggest that maybe the committee
 
03:35:17.510 --> 03:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
would consider a
 
03:35:20.510 --> 03:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
the reasonably small amount of money you
 
03:35:23.030 --> 03:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
know a million or two or three just to
 
03:35:26.210 --> 03:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
create a placeholder in terms of you
 
03:35:28.550 --> 03:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
know signaling to the towns that the
 
03:35:30.950 --> 03:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
current model is approaching its end of
 
03:35:33.229 --> 03:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
life and they need to start planning
 
03:35:35.630 --> 03:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
differently you know I think the
 
03:35:37.790 --> 03:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
objections would be much less
 
03:35:39.950 --> 03:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
significant in terms of oh my God this
 
03:35:42.349 --> 03:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
is rushed if we would only touch a small
 
03:35:44.150 --> 03:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
part of the money and leave the bulk of
 
03:35:46.490 --> 03:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
it as it is I just wanted to put this on
 
03:35:48.110 --> 03:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
you know for the committee to consider
 
03:35:51.650 --> 03:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:54.349 --> 03:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
at a lower level
 
03:35:56.809 --> 03:35:56.819 align:start position:0%
get the idea out there
 
03:35:59.750 --> 03:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
well thank you Jr welcome
 
03:36:05.929 --> 03:36:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:08.750 --> 03:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thank you Mr chairman uh one
 
03:36:10.130 --> 03:36:10.140 align:start position:0%
of the things we've been working on this
 
03:36:12.110 --> 03:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
since 2011 because that's why the
 
03:36:14.570 --> 03:36:14.580 align:start position:0%
moratorium is put in place we we've been
 
03:36:16.070 --> 03:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
putting this off and putting this off
 
03:36:18.110 --> 03:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
and putting us off and matter of fact
 
03:36:20.330 --> 03:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
there's several of us here that uh have
 
03:36:23.150 --> 03:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
seen that happen and we we need to we
 
03:36:24.710 --> 03:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
need to get off you know get something
 
03:36:26.990 --> 03:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
done because uh we keep putting it off
 
03:36:28.969 --> 03:36:28.979 align:start position:0%
and the more you keep putting it off the
 
03:36:31.790 --> 03:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:31.800 --> 03:36:34.250 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:36:34.250 --> 03:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:36:40.429 --> 03:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:43.429 --> 03:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
this is a huge topic
 
03:36:45.590 --> 03:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
and we've been looking at it in
 
03:36:47.630 --> 03:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
education policy and we provided
 
03:36:49.969 --> 03:36:49.979 align:start position:0%
information before I'm looking right now
 
03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
in the state of Montana
 
03:36:51.840 --> 03:36:52.910 align:start position:0%
in the state of Montana
okay

03:36:52.910 --> 03:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:36:54.830 --> 03:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
the state of Montana went through this
 
03:36:58.550 --> 03:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
process and in HP one they allocated 2.5
 
03:37:02.269 --> 03:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
million dollars uh for the condition
 
03:37:05.450 --> 03:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
assessment to conduct a K-12 Public
 
03:37:07.610 --> 03:37:07.620 align:start position:0%
Schools facility condition assessment of
 
03:37:10.550 --> 03:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
all schools in their state so they knew
 
03:37:12.110 --> 03:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
what they were dealing with just as
 
03:37:14.030 --> 03:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
starters they looked at facility
 
03:37:16.969 --> 03:37:16.979 align:start position:0%
condition they looked at energy use they
 
03:37:18.650 --> 03:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
looked at educational characteristics
 
03:37:20.389 --> 03:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
and they looked at technological
 
03:37:22.969 --> 03:37:22.979 align:start position:0%
infrastructure within the schools
 
03:37:26.330 --> 03:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
I'd like to remind you that 50 of the
 
03:37:28.130 --> 03:37:28.140 align:start position:0%
school buildings in New Hampshire are
 
03:37:30.469 --> 03:37:30.479 align:start position:0%
over 60 years old
 
03:37:34.010 --> 03:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
six percent built prior to 1900.
 
03:37:38.510 --> 03:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
26 percent built prior to 1950. seven
 
03:37:41.269 --> 03:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
schools over 60 years old have not had a
 
03:37:44.590 --> 03:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
major renovation in more than 50 years
 
03:37:48.050 --> 03:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
196 schools that 60 percent originally
 
03:37:50.630 --> 03:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
built 50 plus years ago
 
03:37:53.630 --> 03:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
15 percent of schools are using portable
 
03:37:53.640 --> 03:37:55.729 align:start position:0%
15 percent of schools are using portable
classrooms

03:37:55.729 --> 03:37:55.739 align:start position:0%
classrooms
 
03:37:58.790 --> 03:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
so we have some real situations out
 
03:38:01.550 --> 03:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
there in our state here which need
 
03:38:01.560 --> 03:38:03.110 align:start position:0%
there in our state here which need
address

03:38:03.110 --> 03:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
address
 
03:38:04.849 --> 03:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to start thinking
 
03:38:06.110 --> 03:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
well we're going to fund X number
 
03:38:08.210 --> 03:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
dollars per pupil
 
03:38:09.830 --> 03:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
then we gotta consider the
 
03:38:11.450 --> 03:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
characteristics of what a middle school
 
03:38:13.729 --> 03:38:13.739 align:start position:0%
is I heard k through eight no middle
 
03:38:16.010 --> 03:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
schools are grades four through eight
 
03:38:18.590 --> 03:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
and sometimes nine
 
03:38:21.050 --> 03:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
so the structure from one place in a
 
03:38:22.729 --> 03:38:22.739 align:start position:0%
state to another place in the state are
 
03:38:24.050 --> 03:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
very different
 
03:38:26.330 --> 03:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
and would that go the cost for
 
03:38:28.190 --> 03:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
elementary middle and high school
 
03:38:30.650 --> 03:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
instruction and curriculum and delivery
 
03:38:31.729 --> 03:38:31.739 align:start position:0%
of services
 
03:38:34.370 --> 03:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
when we put this formula we have in
 
03:38:36.769 --> 03:38:36.779 align:start position:0%
place now and it's not perfect
 
03:38:39.889 --> 03:38:39.899 align:start position:0%
but we had a working group which
 
03:38:43.490 --> 03:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
involved folks from other states as well
 
03:38:46.250 --> 03:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
my in fact my old athletic director who
 
03:38:47.809 --> 03:38:47.819 align:start position:0%
was who was the commissioner of
 
03:38:49.910 --> 03:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
education for the state of Maine came
 
03:38:53.510 --> 03:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
over and explained their uh process for
 
03:38:55.790 --> 03:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
building Aid there's a lot of different
 
03:38:57.650 --> 03:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
ways to do it you look any education
 
03:38:58.969 --> 03:38:58.979 align:start position:0%
Commission in States and they will
 
03:39:01.010 --> 03:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
provide you that information I got that
 
03:39:03.950 --> 03:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
report just yesterday and so I would
 
03:39:05.630 --> 03:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
suggest that anything you're planning to
 
03:39:05.640 --> 03:39:06.650 align:start position:0%
suggest that anything you're planning to
do

03:39:06.650 --> 03:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:39:08.809 --> 03:39:08.819 align:start position:0%
don't go over the deep edge
 
03:39:11.630 --> 03:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
work with policy and let's do this thing
 
03:39:14.570 --> 03:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
properly so we don't go down the rabbit
 
03:39:16.610 --> 03:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
hole and end up I'll figure how we're
 
03:39:18.290 --> 03:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
going to get out of it
 
03:39:19.910 --> 03:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:39:23.690 --> 03:39:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:26.990 --> 03:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:35.090 --> 03:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:36.710 --> 03:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
Mickey should have already passed this
 
03:39:41.929 --> 03:39:41.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:43.849 --> 03:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
I've got some other uh longer
 
03:39:43.859 --> 03:39:49.849 align:start position:0%
I've got some other uh longer
spreadsheets

03:39:49.849 --> 03:39:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:49.859 --> 03:39:55.790 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:39:55.790 --> 03:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:55.800 --> 03:39:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
three

03:39:59.590 --> 03:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:02.510 --> 03:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
I feel like whenever I do an adequacy uh
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet it's just a fight with the
 
03:40:06.349 --> 03:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
printer and I always lose and um the
 
03:40:18.229 --> 03:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:19.969 --> 03:40:19.979 align:start position:0%
so for the record Mark Manganiello

03:40:26.690 --> 03:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
so I know I was here uh last month it
 
03:40:29.389 --> 03:40:29.399 align:start position:0%
seemed seemed like longer than that
 
03:40:29.399 --> 03:40:30.769 align:start position:0%
seemed seemed like longer than that
um

03:40:30.769 --> 03:40:30.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:30.779 --> 03:40:32.389 align:start position:0%
um
uh

03:40:32.389 --> 03:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:40:34.969 --> 03:40:34.979 align:start position:0%
going over the 2024 District adequacy
 
03:40:37.550 --> 03:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
formula so in this packet not looking at
 
03:40:38.690 --> 03:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
the Town by Town we're going to be going
 
03:40:41.150 --> 03:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
through this packet the first page is
 
03:40:44.450 --> 03:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
your 2024 current Law formula so I know
 
03:40:45.710 --> 03:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
we discussed this
 
03:40:48.229 --> 03:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
um last month but we'll just go over it
 
03:40:49.429 --> 03:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
kind of briefly just so you under
 
03:40:51.170 --> 03:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
remember the structure of the adequacy
 
03:40:53.809 --> 03:40:53.819 align:start position:0%
formula that document page two the
 
03:40:56.870 --> 03:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 formula
 
03:40:56.880 --> 03:40:58.190 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 formula
so

03:40:58.190 --> 03:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:41:00.410 --> 03:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
the way the formula works it's highly
 
03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
driven by student data so each student
 
03:41:06.349 --> 03:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
is 18 ADM an average daily membership
 
03:41:08.210 --> 03:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
it's how we measure a student's
 
03:41:10.370 --> 03:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
membership within a school district for
 
03:41:12.830 --> 03:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
a full year so we're using adms student
 
03:41:13.969 --> 03:41:13.979 align:start position:0%
accounts whatever you want to call it
 
03:41:16.969 --> 03:41:16.979 align:start position:0%
the technical term is ADM but each ADM
 
03:41:16.979 --> 03:41:19.809 align:start position:0%
the technical term is ADM but each ADM
is

03:41:19.809 --> 03:41:19.819 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:41:23.510 --> 03:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
3866.18 so that is your base aid for
 
03:41:26.090 --> 03:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
each ADM students educate or towns have
 
03:41:27.950 --> 03:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
more than one student typically so it's
 
03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
usually one time or you know 10 students
 
03:41:32.570 --> 03:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
times there are 20 students or a
 
03:41:33.469 --> 03:41:33.479 align:start position:0%
thousand students or if you're
 
03:41:35.929 --> 03:41:35.939 align:start position:0%
Manchester over ten thousand students uh
 
03:41:35.939 --> 03:41:36.969 align:start position:0%
Manchester over ten thousand students uh
per

03:41:36.969 --> 03:41:36.979 align:start position:0%
per
 
03:41:39.710 --> 03:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
3866 dollars and eighteen cents that
 
03:41:41.990 --> 03:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
gets you your base adequacy Aid amount
 
03:41:43.790 --> 03:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
then we look at other demographic
 
03:41:45.349 --> 03:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
information about that student we look
 
03:41:46.969 --> 03:41:46.979 align:start position:0%
at if they are experiencing poverty
 
03:41:49.729 --> 03:41:49.739 align:start position:0%
meaning they are below 185 percent of
 
03:41:51.889 --> 03:41:51.899 align:start position:0%
the federal poverty guidelines so they
 
03:41:53.690 --> 03:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
are eligible for the free and reduced
 
03:41:55.790 --> 03:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
price meals program within their school
 
03:41:57.290 --> 03:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
district and if they're eligible
 
03:41:59.330 --> 03:41:59.340 align:start position:0%
eligible for that program sometimes
 
03:42:02.870 --> 03:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
we'll say fnr fnr student we add in
 
03:42:04.849 --> 03:42:04.859 align:start position:0%
addition to base adequacy we add the one
 
03:42:07.910 --> 03:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
thousand nine thousand one thousand nine
 
03:42:09.170 --> 03:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
hundred thirty three dollars and eight
 
03:42:11.990 --> 03:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
cents for each one of those students we
 
03:42:13.309 --> 03:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
also look for other demographic
 
03:42:14.750 --> 03:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
information about that student we look
 
03:42:16.849 --> 03:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
if they have receiving IEP services and
 
03:42:19.450 --> 03:42:19.460 align:start position:0%
they're a sped student and we add
 
03:42:22.250 --> 03:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
2079.89 to the cost of an adequate
 
03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
education calculation as we go through
 
03:42:27.050 --> 03:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
these metrics uh moving forward English
 
03:42:28.370 --> 03:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
language Learners if they are an English
 
03:42:30.250 --> 03:42:30.260 align:start position:0%
language learner we had
 
03:42:30.260 --> 03:42:31.990 align:start position:0%
language learner we had
756.43

03:42:31.990 --> 03:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
756.43
 
03:42:34.070 --> 03:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
to the cost of an adequate education
 
03:42:34.080 --> 03:42:36.290 align:start position:0%
to the cost of an adequate education
calculation

03:42:36.290 --> 03:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
03:42:37.729 --> 03:42:37.739 align:start position:0%
um last one is third grade reading third
 
03:42:39.590 --> 03:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
grade reading is if they score below
 
03:42:40.969 --> 03:42:40.979 align:start position:0%
proficient on the third grade reading
 
03:42:40.979 --> 03:42:42.110 align:start position:0%
proficient on the third grade reading
test

03:42:42.110 --> 03:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
test
 
03:42:44.690 --> 03:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
um are in third grade and are not f r
 
03:42:46.550 --> 03:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
eligible are not receiving sped Services
 
03:42:48.710 --> 03:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
nor are they an English language learner
 
03:42:50.269 --> 03:42:50.279 align:start position:0%
so for there any one of those categories
 
03:42:52.550 --> 03:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
they are excluded from that Aid
 
03:42:53.929 --> 03:42:53.939 align:start position:0%
um and the score below proficient on the
 
03:42:56.469 --> 03:42:56.479 align:start position:0%
third grade reading test we give
 
03:43:00.050 --> 03:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
756.43 for that student and so I have
 
03:43:01.250 --> 03:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
another document that will they'll
 
03:43:03.050 --> 03:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
explain this but that is typically
 
03:43:04.670 --> 03:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
called the left side of the formula
 
03:43:06.410 --> 03:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
because we work the formula left to
 
03:43:07.729 --> 03:43:07.739 align:start position:0%
right that is the first part of the
 
03:43:09.650 --> 03:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
formula so we call that the left side of
 
03:43:11.330 --> 03:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
the formula sometimes we call that the
 
03:43:13.130 --> 03:43:13.140 align:start position:0%
Constitutional side of the formula
 
03:43:16.550 --> 03:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
because it's linked back to RSA 193 uh e
 
03:43:19.670 --> 03:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
so we're telling up all those metrics
 
03:43:20.750 --> 03:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
and we're getting the cost of an
 
03:43:22.250 --> 03:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
adequate education the cost of an
 
03:43:25.130 --> 03:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
adequate education is uh what the state
 
03:43:27.530 --> 03:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
has has determined is what is necessary
 
03:43:29.630 --> 03:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
for you to provide the opportunity for
 
03:43:31.130 --> 03:43:31.140 align:start position:0%
an adequate education according to state
 
03:43:34.010 --> 03:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
law so if we tally up all those metrics
 
03:43:35.990 --> 03:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
um we get a number we tally up the base
 
03:43:38.450 --> 03:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
base a time all the different adms F and
 
03:43:40.190 --> 03:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
R times all the all the adms in the
 
03:43:40.200 --> 03:43:41.030 align:start position:0%
R times all the all the adms in the
community

03:43:41.030 --> 03:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:43:42.889 --> 03:43:42.899 align:start position:0%
and so if we tally that all up we might
 
03:43:44.450 --> 03:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
get a cost of an adequate education of a
 
03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
if we get a cost of an adequate
 
03:43:49.190 --> 03:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
education of a million dollars
 
03:43:51.349 --> 03:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
um the state is obligated to ensure that
 
03:43:52.790 --> 03:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
you have a million dollars to provide
 
03:43:54.469 --> 03:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
that opportunity of an adequate
 
03:43:56.809 --> 03:43:56.819 align:start position:0%
education but before we cut a check for
 
03:43:58.849 --> 03:43:58.859 align:start position:0%
a million dollars we look to see what
 
03:44:01.130 --> 03:44:01.140 align:start position:0%
your swept is and so if a community
 
03:44:02.750 --> 03:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
raised five hundred thousand dollars
 
03:44:04.370 --> 03:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
through their swept tax the Statewide
 
03:44:06.710 --> 03:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
education property tax the state would
 
03:44:09.170 --> 03:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
cut a check for 500 000 so they have
 
03:44:10.610 --> 03:44:10.620 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars in swept
 
03:44:13.429 --> 03:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
which I sometimes call a swept Grant
 
03:44:15.410 --> 03:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
um then they also have 500 000 in
 
03:44:17.990 --> 03:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes called an adequacy Grant so in
 
03:44:19.490 --> 03:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
total they have the million dollars
 
03:44:21.290 --> 03:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
therefore they have the money necessary
 
03:44:23.210 --> 03:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
to provide that adequate education as
 
03:44:24.650 --> 03:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
defined by the state
 
03:44:27.170 --> 03:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
then there's these that's that's most
 
03:44:28.729 --> 03:44:28.739 align:start position:0%
communities most communities the cost of
 
03:44:31.250 --> 03:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
an adequate education is greater than
 
03:44:33.110 --> 03:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
their swept but then there's some
 
03:44:34.610 --> 03:44:34.620 align:start position:0%
communities that are called excess swept
 
03:44:34.620 --> 03:44:35.929 align:start position:0%
communities that are called excess swept
communities

03:44:35.929 --> 03:44:35.939 align:start position:0%
communities
 
03:44:38.150 --> 03:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
um uh those communities the cost of
 
03:44:39.710 --> 03:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
inadequate education could be a million
 
03:44:41.929 --> 03:44:41.939 align:start position:0%
dollars the swept brought in could be
 
03:44:43.670 --> 03:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
two million dollars therefore they have
 
03:44:46.849 --> 03:44:46.859 align:start position:0%
excess swept of one million dollars
 
03:44:48.170 --> 03:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
because they have one million dollars
 
03:44:50.450 --> 03:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
over an adequate education
 
03:44:50.460 --> 03:44:51.229 align:start position:0%
over an adequate education
um

03:44:51.229 --> 03:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:51.239 --> 03:44:52.550 align:start position:0%
um
uh

03:44:52.550 --> 03:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:44:55.670 --> 03:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
that uh over uh over 10 years ago there
 
03:44:57.889 --> 03:44:57.899 align:start position:0%
used to be a law in place that if you
 
03:44:59.630 --> 03:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
had excess swept you had to remit that
 
03:45:01.190 --> 03:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
03:45:02.510 --> 03:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
um those were called
 
03:45:04.130 --> 03:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
um those communities said we are donor
 
03:45:06.710 --> 03:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
towns and they advocated for not having
 
03:45:08.630 --> 03:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
that regime in place so that regime has
 
03:45:10.849 --> 03:45:10.859 align:start position:0%
not existed for over 10 years
 
03:45:12.290 --> 03:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
um so now if you have two million
 
03:45:13.550 --> 03:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
dollars in swept and the cost of an
 
03:45:16.370 --> 03:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
adequate education of a million dollars
 
03:45:17.809 --> 03:45:17.819 align:start position:0%
um you don't remit anything to the state
 
03:45:19.790 --> 03:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
you keep all two million dollars locally
 
03:45:21.889 --> 03:45:21.899 align:start position:0%
your municipality sends it all to your
 
03:45:24.229 --> 03:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
school district and so the swept grant
 
03:45:25.729 --> 03:45:25.739 align:start position:0%
for that Community would be two million
 
03:45:25.739 --> 03:45:26.809 align:start position:0%
for that Community would be two million
dollars

03:45:26.809 --> 03:45:26.819 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:45:28.910 --> 03:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
so it's just important to remember what
 
03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
excess swept is because it interacts
 
03:45:33.110 --> 03:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
with the funding formula the way you see
 
03:45:35.990 --> 03:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
the math kind of shake out and so that
 
03:45:38.150 --> 03:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
is essentially the left side of the
 
03:45:40.729 --> 03:45:40.739 align:start position:0%
formula we're talking about now there's
 
03:45:41.929 --> 03:45:41.939 align:start position:0%
something called the right side of the
 
03:45:43.969 --> 03:45:43.979 align:start position:0%
formula which this is Aid that is above
 
03:45:45.290 --> 03:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
and beyond the cost of an adequate
 
03:45:45.300 --> 03:45:46.490 align:start position:0%
and beyond the cost of an adequate
education

03:45:46.490 --> 03:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:45:49.729 --> 03:45:49.739 align:start position:0%
and so you might uh I know we talked
 
03:45:51.590 --> 03:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
about this last month but relief aid
 
03:45:55.309 --> 03:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
grant that is a Statewide 17.5 million
 
03:45:57.349 --> 03:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
dollar Grant it's based on the
 
03:45:59.690 --> 03:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
percentage of f r population within your
 
03:45:59.700 --> 03:46:00.710 align:start position:0%
percentage of f r population within your
community

03:46:00.710 --> 03:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:46:03.830 --> 03:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
so if you have a f r percentage above 12
 
03:46:05.990 --> 03:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
percent or for under 12 you don't get
 
03:46:08.030 --> 03:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
you're not eligible for Relief aid over
 
03:46:10.450 --> 03:46:10.460 align:start position:0%
12 percent you start off at receiving
 
03:46:14.809 --> 03:46:14.819 align:start position:0%
150 dollars for each fnr student
 
03:46:17.330 --> 03:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
um and then it kind of escalates up to a
 
03:46:19.370 --> 03:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
maximum Grant it's a sliding scale basis
 
03:46:22.969 --> 03:46:22.979 align:start position:0%
of 600 per each fnr student
 
03:46:25.070 --> 03:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
um if your fnr percentage within your
 
03:46:27.889 --> 03:46:27.899 align:start position:0%
community is 48 or above
 
03:46:30.110 --> 03:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
um so and that Grant is prorated up or
 
03:46:33.050 --> 03:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
down to be 17.5 million each wide uh
 
03:46:35.450 --> 03:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
Statewide so we do the calculation and
 
03:46:37.610 --> 03:46:37.620 align:start position:0%
then we do we back into that 17.5
 
03:46:40.070 --> 03:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
Million number or back up back down into
 
03:46:42.250 --> 03:46:42.260 align:start position:0%
that number to make sure the grant is uh
 
03:46:45.290 --> 03:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
exactly 17.5 million
 
03:46:47.690 --> 03:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs Grant is a new
 
03:46:50.389 --> 03:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
Grant uh starting this fiscal year and
 
03:46:52.729 --> 03:46:52.739 align:start position:0%
that Grant is based on
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
property values over F and R counts so
 
03:46:58.670 --> 03:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
property values over poverty counts and
 
03:47:00.590 --> 03:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
so if you have it's think of it as a
 
03:47:02.570 --> 03:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
fraction you have the numerator is
 
03:47:04.790 --> 03:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
property the denominators uh poverty
 
03:47:07.670 --> 03:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
counts so if you have a lot of property
 
03:47:09.950 --> 03:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
and not a lot of students experiencing
 
03:47:12.170 --> 03:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
poverty you would receive a high number
 
03:47:15.830 --> 03:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
if you have a low tax base and a lot of
 
03:47:17.750 --> 03:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
students in poverty you would have a low
 
03:47:20.809 --> 03:47:20.819 align:start position:0%
number so when we do that metric we I
 
03:47:22.450 --> 03:47:22.460 align:start position:0%
think we call the acronym
 
03:47:25.070 --> 03:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
evpfr so it's equalized valuation per
 
03:47:26.809 --> 03:47:26.819 align:start position:0%
each fnr pupil I don't think we've
 
03:47:29.570 --> 03:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
settled on unofficial acronym yet
 
03:47:29.580 --> 03:47:30.170 align:start position:0%
settled on unofficial acronym yet
um

03:47:30.170 --> 03:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:32.210 --> 03:47:32.220 align:start position:0%
it's a yeah maybe you can write more you
 
03:47:33.290 --> 03:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
can write in and you can write the
 
03:47:36.410 --> 03:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
acronym in law if you'd like uh so
 
03:47:40.610 --> 03:47:40.620 align:start position:0%
so if it's six million dollars or
 
03:47:43.370 --> 03:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
if your EV FRP your property value is
 
03:47:44.929 --> 03:47:44.939 align:start position:0%
over F and our accounts is six million
 
03:47:47.269 --> 03:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
or higher meaning kind of two things
 
03:47:48.229 --> 03:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
either one you have a company
 
03:47:50.510 --> 03:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
substantial tax base or two you don't
 
03:47:52.010 --> 03:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
have a lot of students experiencing
 
03:47:54.530 --> 03:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
poverty or a combination of the two so
 
03:47:56.570 --> 03:47:56.580 align:start position:0%
if it's over six million dollars
 
03:47:58.250 --> 03:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
um you do not receive an extraordinary
 
03:48:00.830 --> 03:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
needs Grant if it's a million dollars or
 
03:48:03.650 --> 03:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
under you receive a grant of six hundred
 
03:48:05.269 --> 03:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
and fifty dollars for each fnr student
 
03:48:07.190 --> 03:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
and so that Grant Works similar to
 
03:48:09.050 --> 03:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
relief Aid it's escalating it's a
 
03:48:10.910 --> 03:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
sliding scale Grant so your Grant is
 
03:48:13.610 --> 03:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
going to start at 650 if you're at that
 
03:48:16.370 --> 03:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
one million EV FRP number and it's going
 
03:48:18.050 --> 03:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
to slowly decrease on a sliding scale
 
03:48:20.570 --> 03:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
basis to eventually get to zero once you
 
03:48:22.729 --> 03:48:22.739 align:start position:0%
get up to six million
 
03:48:24.590 --> 03:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
so there's no fiscal Clips in that Grant
 
03:48:28.010 --> 03:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
or the relief Aid Grant and then
 
03:48:29.870 --> 03:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
um the next Grant which is um on the
 
03:48:31.610 --> 03:48:31.620 align:start position:0%
right side of the formula is the
 
03:48:33.590 --> 03:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant or the stabilization
 
03:48:36.889 --> 03:48:36.899 align:start position:0%
Grant is due to changes in the funding
 
03:48:39.950 --> 03:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
formula during 2012. so there's changes
 
03:48:41.389 --> 03:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
in the funding formula following the
 
03:48:42.950 --> 03:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
Great Recession
 
03:48:44.570 --> 03:48:44.580 align:start position:0%
um I don't know some of the people in
 
03:48:45.590 --> 03:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
the room can talk about the Great
 
03:48:46.610 --> 03:48:46.620 align:start position:0%
Recession and how that was a tough
 
03:48:48.650 --> 03:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
budget year but there was changes to the
 
03:48:52.490 --> 03:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
funding formula that resulted in uh uh
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
the changes to the formula resulted in
 
03:48:55.729 --> 03:48:55.739 align:start position:0%
some communities receiving less money
 
03:48:58.309 --> 03:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
and so what the legislature decided to
 
03:49:01.490 --> 03:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
do is hold them harmless to what they
 
03:49:03.650 --> 03:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
received in 2011. so no Community
 
03:49:05.630 --> 03:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
received less money than what they see
 
03:49:08.450 --> 03:49:08.460 align:start position:0%
received the previous year and in total
 
03:49:11.150 --> 03:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
that cost the state 158 million dollars
 
03:49:14.210 --> 03:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
to build this stabilization Grant and so
 
03:49:16.570 --> 03:49:16.580 align:start position:0%
that's from 2012 is when it was enacted
 
03:49:18.830 --> 03:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
so it was based on changes in the
 
03:49:22.070 --> 03:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
formula from 2011 to 2012. it still
 
03:49:25.190 --> 03:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
exists today uh there's been some
 
03:49:27.170 --> 03:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
legislative history to try to have it
 
03:49:29.510 --> 03:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
phase out but then it was recently
 
03:49:31.849 --> 03:49:31.859 align:start position:0%
restored to the full amount in fiscal
 
03:49:35.690 --> 03:49:35.700 align:start position:0%
year 2020. so right now Statewide that
 
03:49:38.630 --> 03:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
is around 157 million because some
 
03:49:41.150 --> 03:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
communities of lost their eligibility
 
03:49:43.670 --> 03:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
because they um are now in excess swept
 
03:49:44.929 --> 03:49:44.939 align:start position:0%
town if you become an access webtown
 
03:49:46.190 --> 03:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
you're not eligible for the
 
03:49:48.410 --> 03:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant
 
03:49:50.750 --> 03:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
um so Statewide that Grant is 157
 
03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
million uh
 
03:49:56.510 --> 03:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
and that is the 24 current Formula so
 
03:49:58.309 --> 03:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
before I go on to the governor's formula
 
03:49:59.630 --> 03:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions about current
 
03:50:03.290 --> 03:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
law yes so the the stabilization is the
 
03:50:04.849 --> 03:50:04.859 align:start position:0%
same amount of money regardless of your
 
03:50:08.090 --> 03:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
population correct it's a static Grant
 
03:50:09.349 --> 03:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
that's a good question that comes up all
 
03:50:11.870 --> 03:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:11.880 --> 03:50:13.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:50:13.670 --> 03:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:50:16.610 --> 03:50:16.620 align:start position:0%
okay uh new stuff so
 
03:50:19.790 --> 03:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
so this is this is a table and it kind
 
03:50:21.469 --> 03:50:21.479 align:start position:0%
of I'll walk you through the table
 
03:50:23.809 --> 03:50:23.819 align:start position:0%
there's you can see at the top top left
 
03:50:25.670 --> 03:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
hand side left side there's the left
 
03:50:27.950 --> 03:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
side of the formula and so the left side
 
03:50:29.389 --> 03:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
of the formula like I talked about is
 
03:50:30.710 --> 03:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
base Aid and then it's called
 
03:50:32.330 --> 03:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
differential Aid which is basically the
 
03:50:34.490 --> 03:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
fnr raid the sped eight or I'm on page
 
03:50:36.889 --> 03:50:36.899 align:start position:0%
three of the the handout
 
03:50:38.990 --> 03:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
um base Aid so there's that three three
 
03:50:40.190 --> 03:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
thousand eight hundred and sixty six
 
03:50:42.290 --> 03:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
dollars and 18 cents
 
03:50:45.229 --> 03:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
um fnr raid sped Aid ell Aid third grade
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
reading aid that's the left side of the
 
03:50:47.040 --> 03:50:47.929 align:start position:0%
reading aid that's the left side of the
formula

03:50:47.929 --> 03:50:47.939 align:start position:0%
formula
 
03:50:50.210 --> 03:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
then we have swept Grant in the middle
 
03:50:52.070 --> 03:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
and then on the right side we have the
 
03:50:54.650 --> 03:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
right side of the formula and so
 
03:50:56.570 --> 03:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
I've added two more Dimensions to this
 
03:50:58.309 --> 03:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
because there's three different adequacy
 
03:51:00.290 --> 03:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
programs I I just walked you through the
 
03:51:02.450 --> 03:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
district public adequacy program but we
 
03:51:04.550 --> 03:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
also have Charter adequacy and we also
 
03:51:07.910 --> 03:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
have EFA adequacy so this is showing you
 
03:51:10.309 --> 03:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
all all three adequacy programs there
 
03:51:12.110 --> 03:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
and it's showing you how they sync up
 
03:51:13.910 --> 03:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
with the left side of the formula and
 
03:51:15.410 --> 03:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
how they sync up with the right side of
 
03:51:18.410 --> 03:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
the formula so on the right side of the
 
03:51:19.790 --> 03:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
formula we also have something called an
 
03:51:21.610 --> 03:51:21.620 align:start position:0%
additional grant
 
03:51:23.990 --> 03:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
that is only about if you look kind of
 
03:51:25.429 --> 03:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
at the middle columns there Charter
 
03:51:27.050 --> 03:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
adequacy the additional Grant only
 
03:51:29.030 --> 03:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
applies to Charter Schools and I think
 
03:51:31.729 --> 03:51:31.739 align:start position:0%
we talked about that last month or at
 
03:51:33.290 --> 03:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
some point we ran over the charter
 
03:51:35.750 --> 03:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
school adequacy formula but the charter
 
03:51:37.729 --> 03:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
school adequacy formula is the left side
 
03:51:39.950 --> 03:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
of the formula and the additional Grant
 
03:51:41.690 --> 03:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
and I have notes there on the bottom
 
03:51:43.190 --> 03:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
about how much the additional Grant is
 
03:51:43.200 --> 03:51:45.429 align:start position:0%
about how much the additional Grant is
it's

03:51:45.429 --> 03:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:51:49.670 --> 03:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
3552.28 for non-v-lax and then velax
 
03:51:51.830 --> 03:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
gets 2 300.
 
03:51:53.690 --> 03:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
so that's a part of the right side of
 
03:51:56.570 --> 03:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
the formula uh also part of the right
 
03:51:58.010 --> 03:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
side of the formula is relief Aid which
 
03:51:59.570 --> 03:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
we just discussed discussed
 
03:52:01.309 --> 03:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs part of the right
 
03:52:03.769 --> 03:52:03.779 align:start position:0%
side of the formula stabilization and
 
03:52:06.530 --> 03:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
now the governor has a new hold harmless
 
03:52:08.630 --> 03:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
that he'll be enacting
 
03:52:08.640 --> 03:52:10.010 align:start position:0%
that he'll be enacting
so

03:52:10.010 --> 03:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:52:11.870 --> 03:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
I showed you current law
 
03:52:13.490 --> 03:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
so if you want to go down to here where
 
03:52:16.070 --> 03:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
it says Governor proposed 2024 that
 
03:52:17.809 --> 03:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
shows you what the governor has proposed
 
03:52:20.389 --> 03:52:20.399 align:start position:0%
and is in hb2
 
03:52:22.190 --> 03:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
the governor has proposed increasing
 
03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
base adequacy Aid so you see it was
 
03:52:26.330 --> 03:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
three eight three thirty eight hundred
 
03:52:27.830 --> 03:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
under current law the governor is
 
03:52:31.130 --> 03:52:31.140 align:start position:0%
proposing to bring that up to 4 700. and
 
03:52:32.809 --> 03:52:32.819 align:start position:0%
so since he's bringing it up on the left
 
03:52:35.030 --> 03:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
side of the formula it impacts all the
 
03:52:37.910 --> 03:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
adequacy formulas that are that sync up
 
03:52:39.050 --> 03:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
with the left side of the formula which
 
03:52:41.870 --> 03:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
is all of them so it's going to be 4 700
 
03:52:43.729 --> 03:52:43.739 align:start position:0%
for district adequacy it's going to be 4
 
03:52:45.710 --> 03:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
700 for Charter adequacy it's going to
 
03:52:48.530 --> 03:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
be 4 700 for EFA adequacy
 
03:52:50.870 --> 03:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
the governor is also and all the changes
 
03:52:53.030 --> 03:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposing are in Gray the
 
03:52:55.790 --> 03:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
governor is also proposing a change to f
 
03:52:57.170 --> 03:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
f r
 
03:53:00.830 --> 03:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
um uh Aid so under current law it's 1900
 
03:53:02.929 --> 03:53:02.939 align:start position:0%
the governor is proposing to increase it
 
03:53:05.570 --> 03:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
up to 2500 and so again
 
03:53:07.190 --> 03:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's the left side of the formula so it
 
03:53:08.929 --> 03:53:08.939 align:start position:0%
applies to District adequacy it applies
 
03:53:10.790 --> 03:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
to Charter adequacy it applies to EFA
 
03:53:10.800 --> 03:53:11.990 align:start position:0%
to Charter adequacy it applies to EFA
adequacy

03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
03:53:14.269 --> 03:53:14.279 align:start position:0%
the governor is proposing no changes to
 
03:53:16.130 --> 03:53:16.140 align:start position:0%
the sped rates
 
03:53:18.950 --> 03:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
um under 20 for fiscal year 24.
 
03:53:21.050 --> 03:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
um the governor did discuss with the
 
03:53:23.809 --> 03:53:23.819 align:start position:0%
Full House a full finance committee he
 
03:53:26.389 --> 03:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
is changing the CPI trigger
 
03:53:28.670 --> 03:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
um but that deals with fiscal year 24 25
 
03:53:30.889 --> 03:53:30.899 align:start position:0%
so we'll get to that later just staying
 
03:53:33.050 --> 03:53:33.060 align:start position:0%
within fiscal year 24 the governor has
 
03:53:35.030 --> 03:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
no change to spend no change to English
 
03:53:37.010 --> 03:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
language learner the governor is
 
03:53:38.929 --> 03:53:38.939 align:start position:0%
removing the third grade reading
 
03:53:41.090 --> 03:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
component which is about two million
 
03:53:43.070 --> 03:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
dollars Statewide for district schools
 
03:53:45.469 --> 03:53:45.479 align:start position:0%
it's a it's one of the smaller portions
 
03:53:47.570 --> 03:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
of the adequacy left side of the formula
 
03:53:49.910 --> 03:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
so he is proposing removing that
 
03:53:49.920 --> 03:53:51.469 align:start position:0%
so he is proposing removing that
component

03:53:51.469 --> 03:53:51.479 align:start position:0%
component
 
03:53:54.590 --> 03:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
that's in hb2 and so that also again
 
03:53:55.849 --> 03:53:55.859 align:start position:0%
it's the left side of the formula so
 
03:53:58.130 --> 03:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
districts Charters efas would lose that
 
03:54:00.290 --> 03:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
part of the formula but they are gaining
 
03:54:01.969 --> 03:54:01.979 align:start position:0%
the base adequacy Aid increase in the
 
03:54:03.969 --> 03:54:03.979 align:start position:0%
fnr increase as well
 
03:54:07.969 --> 03:54:07.979 align:start position:0%
so moving along uh swept no changes to
 
03:54:10.490 --> 03:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
swept in Governor's proposed budget
 
03:54:14.630 --> 03:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
the additional Grant uh no changes to
 
03:54:16.790 --> 03:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
the additional Grant in the governor's
 
03:54:20.030 --> 03:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh formula the only two things I'll say
 
03:54:21.650 --> 03:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
is one
 
03:54:24.830 --> 03:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
um he did add the CPI increase to uh
 
03:54:28.130 --> 03:54:28.140 align:start position:0%
sorry uh um a two percent
 
03:54:29.330 --> 03:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
um a two percent adjustment will happen
 
03:54:31.790 --> 03:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
to the additional Grant every year under
 
03:54:33.530 --> 03:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
current law it happens every two years
 
03:54:35.689 --> 03:54:35.699 align:start position:0%
so he'll do a CPI adjustment every two
 
03:54:36.889 --> 03:54:36.899 align:start position:0%
years he's doing a two percent every
 
03:54:38.990 --> 03:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
year so that is a change he's proposing
 
03:54:41.269 --> 03:54:41.279 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 25 this table is just
 
03:54:44.210 --> 03:54:44.220 align:start position:0%
representing fiscal year 2024 and and
 
03:54:46.490 --> 03:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
what I will say take a moment to not go
 
03:54:48.769 --> 03:54:48.779 align:start position:0%
on a side track but I want to apologize
 
03:54:49.969 --> 03:54:49.979 align:start position:0%
um I know you have a lot of work to do
 
03:54:52.429 --> 03:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
and not a lot of time and uh talking
 
03:54:53.929 --> 03:54:53.939 align:start position:0%
with Hal said
 
03:54:56.090 --> 03:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
I think they had 96 bills a lot of bills
 
03:54:58.070 --> 03:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
to go through I think I do still owe you
 
03:54:59.389 --> 03:54:59.399 align:start position:0%
Mickey's been trying to prioritize
 
03:55:01.250 --> 03:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
prioritize the bills that need analysis
 
03:55:02.330 --> 03:55:02.340 align:start position:0%
right away
 
03:55:03.950 --> 03:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
um so I do owe you a lot of fiscal notes
 
03:55:06.410 --> 03:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
one of those fiscal fiscal notes is uh
 
03:55:07.969 --> 03:55:07.979 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney's Bill relative to
 
03:55:09.530 --> 03:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
Charter Aid
 
03:55:11.689 --> 03:55:11.699 align:start position:0%
um uh hell said he just came out of the
 
03:55:13.250 --> 03:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
house floor how sad house floor I think
 
03:55:14.870 --> 03:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's in this committee now um so I'm
 
03:55:16.490 --> 03:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
going to prioritize getting you the
 
03:55:18.590 --> 03:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
latest numbers on that so you can make a
 
03:55:20.090 --> 03:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
decision on that bill with with the best
 
03:55:23.150 --> 03:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
possible data uh so I apologize for for
 
03:55:26.689 --> 03:55:26.699 align:start position:0%
those delays back to the formula
 
03:55:29.570 --> 03:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
um relief Aid the governor is
 
03:55:32.269 --> 03:55:32.279 align:start position:0%
the governor is proposing uh removing
 
03:55:34.189 --> 03:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
relief Aid
 
03:55:38.689 --> 03:55:38.699 align:start position:0%
uh removing relief Aid uh
 
03:55:41.269 --> 03:55:41.279 align:start position:0%
keeping extraordinary needs Grant
 
03:55:44.030 --> 03:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
removing stabilization and then building
 
03:55:46.910 --> 03:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
a new hold harmless Grant and so in the
 
03:55:48.590 --> 03:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
next tab I'll walk through some of the
 
03:55:50.210 --> 03:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
math on how that works out on a
 
03:55:51.889 --> 03:55:51.899 align:start position:0%
Statewide basis and then there's some
 
03:55:53.269 --> 03:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
also some spreadsheets on how it works
 
03:55:55.429 --> 03:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
on a Town by Town basis but really I
 
03:55:56.809 --> 03:55:56.819 align:start position:0%
just wanted you to all remember that the
 
03:55:58.550 --> 03:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
left side of the formula hits through
 
03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:05.590 --> 03:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
just a quick question
 
03:56:08.510 --> 03:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
in the governor proposed District tag
 
03:56:10.849 --> 03:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
with adequacy three of the No No and yes
 
03:56:12.889 --> 03:56:12.899 align:start position:0%
is are underlined any particular meaning
 
03:56:15.710 --> 03:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
behind that or just uh inconsistency I
 
03:56:17.389 --> 03:56:17.399 align:start position:0%
don't want to go crazy for a meeting
 
03:56:19.189 --> 03:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
that was that was that was on purpose so
 
03:56:21.410 --> 03:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
this what's underlined is because the
 
03:56:23.750 --> 03:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
governor has changed current law gotcha
 
03:56:29.469 --> 03:56:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:31.910 --> 03:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
under the governor's
 
03:56:31.920 --> 03:56:33.429 align:start position:0%
under the governor's
um

03:56:33.429 --> 03:56:33.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:36.889 --> 03:56:36.899 align:start position:0%
formula he'd get the charter individual
 
03:56:38.750 --> 03:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
student would get forty seven hundred
 
03:56:41.450 --> 03:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
dollars plus whatever of these they'd
 
03:56:41.460 --> 03:56:42.710 align:start position:0%
dollars plus whatever of these they'd
get

03:56:42.710 --> 03:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
get
 
03:56:45.530 --> 03:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
for Charter yep yep uh base Aid and
 
03:56:47.710 --> 03:56:47.720 align:start position:0%
differential and
 
03:56:47.720 --> 03:56:49.450 align:start position:0%
differential and
3552

03:56:49.450 --> 03:56:49.460 align:start position:0%
3552
 
03:56:54.050 --> 03:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
correct and I think didn't we just
 
03:56:55.790 --> 03:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
um pass a bill that they'd get a
 
03:56:58.790 --> 03:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars more in-house ad that's
 
03:57:00.590 --> 03:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney's bill which is in
 
03:57:02.870 --> 03:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
this committee yes and so that modifies
 
03:57:05.570 --> 03:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
the additional Grant component um okay
 
03:57:07.910 --> 03:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
so if you if you choose to uh adopt that
 
03:57:07.920 --> 03:57:09.290 align:start position:0%
so if you if you choose to uh adopt that
position

03:57:09.290 --> 03:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:57:11.030 --> 03:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
um that would add a thousand dollars so
 
03:57:12.469 --> 03:57:12.479 align:start position:0%
Charters would get a significant
 
03:57:14.269 --> 03:57:14.279 align:start position:0%
increase they would get a thousand
 
03:57:15.769 --> 03:57:15.779 align:start position:0%
dollars per people under that bill as
 
03:57:17.030 --> 03:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
amended by
 
03:57:18.170 --> 03:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if amended by the house
 
03:57:22.849 --> 03:57:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:25.130 --> 03:57:25.140 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to move on to the next
 
03:57:30.650 --> 03:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:32.570 --> 03:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of numbers on the sheet
 
03:57:34.729 --> 03:57:34.739 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of details
 
03:57:36.889 --> 03:57:36.899 align:start position:0%
um so this is kind of something for you
 
03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
to study maybe we won't go through all
 
03:57:41.450 --> 03:57:41.460 align:start position:0%
of it but I I just kind of want you run
 
03:57:43.729 --> 03:57:43.739 align:start position:0%
you through the math if you can look at
 
03:57:47.210 --> 03:57:47.220 align:start position:0%
The Columns here current current FY 24
 
03:57:50.809 --> 03:57:50.819 align:start position:0%
so that's current law proposed 24 that's
 
03:57:53.030 --> 03:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposed 24 adequacy
 
03:57:55.370 --> 03:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
formula and so here you can kind of see
 
03:57:57.590 --> 03:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
a head to head
 
03:57:59.269 --> 03:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
um and see it how it impacts the aid
 
03:58:02.090 --> 03:58:02.100 align:start position:0%
amounts so when the governor proposes
 
03:58:05.210 --> 03:58:05.220 align:start position:0%
increasing the raid rate to 4 700 you
 
03:58:07.070 --> 03:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
can see that base adequacy Aid goes from
 
03:58:10.729 --> 03:58:10.739 align:start position:0%
a 606 million dollar number to a 737
 
03:58:12.889 --> 03:58:12.899 align:start position:0%
million dollar number you can see when
 
03:58:15.710 --> 03:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
he proposes increasing the fnr rate
 
03:58:17.929 --> 03:58:17.939 align:start position:0%
um it goes from a 73 million dollar to a
 
03:58:20.090 --> 03:58:20.100 align:start position:0%
94 million dollar number so that's him
 
03:58:21.889 --> 03:58:21.899 align:start position:0%
increasing Aid on the left side of the
 
03:58:23.929 --> 03:58:23.939 align:start position:0%
formula and so when we go down to the
 
03:58:26.210 --> 03:58:26.220 align:start position:0%
bottom and tally that up and then back
 
03:58:27.650 --> 03:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
out the two million dollars in third
 
03:58:29.809 --> 03:58:29.819 align:start position:0%
grade reading the grand total there is
 
03:58:31.849 --> 03:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
150 million dollars an increased Aid on
 
03:58:35.030 --> 03:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
the left side of the formula so
 
03:58:37.250 --> 03:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
um but his proposal doesn't cost 150
 
03:58:39.290 --> 03:58:39.300 align:start position:0%
million over current law some of that is
 
03:58:41.150 --> 03:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
funded through though decreasing the
 
03:58:43.370 --> 03:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
right side of the formula so he's
 
03:58:46.250 --> 03:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
decreased to 17.5 million from the right
 
03:58:47.450 --> 03:58:47.460 align:start position:0%
side of the formula in the form of
 
03:58:50.809 --> 03:58:50.819 align:start position:0%
relief Aid he's taken out stabilization
 
03:58:54.610 --> 03:58:54.620 align:start position:0%
so in grand total that is a decrease of
 
03:58:58.370 --> 03:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
174 million so we have an increase of
 
03:59:00.349 --> 03:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
150 million on the left side a decrease
 
03:59:03.530 --> 03:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
of 174 on the right side of the formula
 
03:59:05.650 --> 03:59:05.660 align:start position:0%
some communities because they've lost
 
03:59:08.210 --> 03:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
not really so relief Aid because relief
 
03:59:10.910 --> 03:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
Aid is pretty much the highest that
 
03:59:13.610 --> 03:59:13.620 align:start position:0%
Grant could be is 600 per pupil and the
 
03:59:15.889 --> 03:59:15.899 align:start position:0%
governor's already given over 500 per
 
03:59:19.130 --> 03:59:19.140 align:start position:0%
people on base f r Aid so really
 
03:59:19.140 --> 03:59:20.809 align:start position:0%
people on base f r Aid so really
um

03:59:20.809 --> 03:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:22.910 --> 03:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
some districts are receiving less Aid
 
03:59:24.889 --> 03:59:24.899 align:start position:0%
not because of relief Aid being gone but
 
03:59:26.929 --> 03:59:26.939 align:start position:0%
really because stabilization is gone and
 
03:59:29.630 --> 03:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
so since stabilization is gone for some
 
03:59:31.670 --> 03:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
communities if you increase base
 
03:59:34.969 --> 03:59:34.979 align:start position:0%
adequacy up to 4 700 if you increase fnr
 
03:59:37.490 --> 03:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
adequacy up to 2500
 
03:59:39.590 --> 03:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
it does not overcome the the
 
03:59:42.050 --> 03:59:42.060 align:start position:0%
stabilization grant that they had so
 
03:59:44.210 --> 03:59:44.220 align:start position:0%
there is a new hold harmless Grant to
 
03:59:47.150 --> 03:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
hold them harmless in fiscal year 24 and
 
03:59:49.429 --> 03:59:49.439 align:start position:0%
that one caught that Grant cost 87
 
03:59:51.769 --> 03:59:51.779 align:start position:0%
million dollars so
 
03:59:54.469 --> 03:59:54.479 align:start position:0%
um basically funding if you're so
 
03:59:56.090 --> 03:59:56.100 align:start position:0%
basically the increased Aid on the left
 
03:59:58.370 --> 03:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
side of the formula is making it less is
 
04:00:00.229 --> 04:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
making it cheaper than 157 million
 
04:00:02.990 --> 04:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
dollars it's making it only 87 million
 
04:00:03.000 --> 04:00:04.910 align:start position:0%
dollars it's making it only 87 million
dollars

04:00:04.910 --> 04:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:00:06.950 --> 04:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:00:09.229 --> 04:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
so we know that school district
 
04:00:11.630 --> 04:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
enrollment room we have gone down
 
04:00:13.550 --> 04:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
they've been held kind of in this
 
04:00:17.210 --> 04:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
coveted status for the last three years
 
04:00:21.650 --> 04:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:24.469 --> 04:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
are really going to see a decline
 
04:00:26.170 --> 04:00:26.180 align:start position:0%
in enrollment
 
04:00:28.990 --> 04:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
overall in their funding because of
 
04:00:32.389 --> 04:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
their brain reduced lunch numbers are
 
04:00:33.769 --> 04:00:33.779 align:start position:0%
probably going to go down because their
 
04:00:35.450 --> 04:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
enrollments have gone down and they're
 
04:00:37.729 --> 04:00:37.739 align:start position:0%
being held to that not the 2019 numbers
 
04:00:41.929 --> 04:00:41.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:45.950 --> 04:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
um am I correct so so in 24 25 the hold
 
04:00:47.450 --> 04:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
harmless and this is we're getting a
 
04:00:49.010 --> 04:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
little bit into the future here
 
04:00:50.030 --> 04:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if it's can I put a
 
04:00:52.309 --> 04:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
pause on that question or okay sorry
 
04:00:55.309 --> 04:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
okay yeah because it really the answer
 
04:00:57.769 --> 04:00:57.779 align:start position:0%
is it depends but
 
04:00:59.210 --> 04:00:59.220 align:start position:0%
but we can we can talk about high level
 
04:01:01.849 --> 04:01:01.859 align:start position:0%
and how the data might shake out
 
04:01:01.859 --> 04:01:02.510 align:start position:0%
and how the data might shake out
um

04:01:02.510 --> 04:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:04.610 --> 04:01:04.620 align:start position:0%
so just just to finish this that is a
 
04:01:05.990 --> 04:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
good question about how things the
 
04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
future might look
 
04:01:10.910 --> 04:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
um we can walk through some examples
 
04:01:10.920 --> 04:01:13.910 align:start position:0%
um we can walk through some examples
the

04:01:13.910 --> 04:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:15.349 --> 04:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:01:17.030 --> 04:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
so there the communities are held
 
04:01:19.130 --> 04:01:19.140 align:start position:0%
harmless in 24.
 
04:01:19.140 --> 04:01:20.090 align:start position:0%
harmless in 24.
um

04:01:20.090 --> 04:01:20.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:22.729 --> 04:01:22.739 align:start position:0%
excess swept uh this is just another
 
04:01:24.830 --> 04:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
technical aspect of the formula just so
 
04:01:26.929 --> 04:01:26.939 align:start position:0%
you can see how the math adds up excess
 
04:01:28.849 --> 04:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
wept under current law is 20 million
 
04:01:31.010 --> 04:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
dollars so that's the swept above and
 
04:01:32.630 --> 04:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
beyond the cost of inadequate education
 
04:01:34.729 --> 04:01:34.739 align:start position:0%
when we tally that up Statewide is 29
 
04:01:37.070 --> 04:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars and so when under the
 
04:01:39.530 --> 04:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
governor's proposed 24 budget
 
04:01:39.540 --> 04:01:40.490 align:start position:0%
governor's proposed 24 budget
um

04:01:40.490 --> 04:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:42.410 --> 04:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
say you have a two million dollar swept
 
04:01:43.610 --> 04:01:43.620 align:start position:0%
this is just getting pretty technical
 
04:01:45.170 --> 04:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
two million dollar swept one million
 
04:01:46.849 --> 04:01:46.859 align:start position:0%
dollar cost of an adequate education if
 
04:01:48.170 --> 04:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
he increases the left side of the
 
04:01:50.030 --> 04:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
formula formula brings you up to 1.5
 
04:01:52.729 --> 04:01:52.739 align:start position:0%
million now you only have 500k excess
 
04:01:54.830 --> 04:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
wept instead of a million excess swept
 
04:01:56.570 --> 04:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
so the governor's formula and since it's
 
04:01:58.849 --> 04:01:58.859 align:start position:0%
growing the left side is decreasing
 
04:02:01.250 --> 04:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
excess swept by about 8 million dollars
 
04:02:04.429 --> 04:02:04.439 align:start position:0%
so if you do the plus 150 on the left
 
04:02:06.530 --> 04:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
side increase decrease the one left
 
04:02:08.990 --> 04:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
right side by 174 add in the hold
 
04:02:11.389 --> 04:02:11.399 align:start position:0%
harmless then back out the excess swept
 
04:02:13.849 --> 04:02:13.859 align:start position:0%
you get the change in current law of 54
 
04:02:15.710 --> 04:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars so that's just how the
 
04:02:17.630 --> 04:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
formula sort of balances out
 
04:02:17.640 --> 04:02:18.410 align:start position:0%
formula sort of balances out
um

04:02:18.410 --> 04:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:20.689 --> 04:02:20.699 align:start position:0%
I'm going to move on to
 
04:02:22.550 --> 04:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
the long-term question if there's any
 
04:02:24.410 --> 04:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
more we have any questions about this
 
04:02:24.420 --> 04:02:26.090 align:start position:0%
more we have any questions about this
document

04:02:26.090 --> 04:02:26.100 align:start position:0%
document
 
04:02:28.969 --> 04:02:28.979 align:start position:0%
so just to since I'm an excess swept
 
04:02:28.979 --> 04:02:30.349 align:start position:0%
so just to since I'm an excess swept
community

04:02:30.349 --> 04:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:02:32.870 --> 04:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to go away
 
04:02:36.830 --> 04:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh no no change no change in excess oh
 
04:02:39.229 --> 04:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
um so excess swept um
 
04:02:41.090 --> 04:02:41.100 align:start position:0%
it will go away but it's a measurement
 
04:02:42.889 --> 04:02:42.899 align:start position:0%
it's just a data point it's not real
 
04:02:44.450 --> 04:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
dollars so if you're if your community
 
04:02:46.670 --> 04:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
has a two million dollar swept Grant
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
your cost of an adequate education is a
 
04:02:50.510 --> 04:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars we increase the cost of
 
04:02:52.670 --> 04:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
an adequate education is 1.5 million
 
04:02:54.769 --> 04:02:54.779 align:start position:0%
you're so up still 2 million so you
 
04:02:56.389 --> 04:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
receive your swept no matter what the
 
04:02:58.130 --> 04:02:58.140 align:start position:0%
governor is proposing no change to swept
 
04:03:00.590 --> 04:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's just the way the funding math works
 
04:03:02.929 --> 04:03:02.939 align:start position:0%
out from as far as balancing out both
 
04:03:04.130 --> 04:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
sides the left and right side of the
 
04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
formula and getting the total to work
 
04:03:05.520 --> 04:03:06.590 align:start position:0%
formula and getting the total to work
out

04:03:06.590 --> 04:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:03:09.050 --> 04:03:09.060 align:start position:0%
um there is less excess swept so if
 
04:03:11.750 --> 04:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
there was yeah but you're not going to
 
04:03:14.330 --> 04:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
sweep it no no no there's no there's no
 
04:03:16.370 --> 04:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
change to there's no there's no donor
 
04:03:18.830 --> 04:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
town There's no you know none of that is
 
04:03:20.809 --> 04:03:20.819 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
04:03:22.790 --> 04:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that I understand this
 
04:03:22.800 --> 04:03:24.170 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that I understand this
correctly

04:03:24.170 --> 04:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
04:03:27.769 --> 04:03:27.779 align:start position:0%
if you remain on excess swept the number
 
04:03:29.570 --> 04:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
of dollars you get does not change it's
 
04:03:31.610 --> 04:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
just a matter of which pocket you know
 
04:03:34.309 --> 04:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
stuff comes from if you were a marginal
 
04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
access swept down now you may actually
 
04:03:38.950 --> 04:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
get additional dollars because your
 
04:03:41.389 --> 04:03:41.399 align:start position:0%
adequacy will now exceed what you were
 
04:03:43.309 --> 04:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
retaining from the swept in the past so
 
04:03:47.030 --> 04:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's a in this it's either a zero loss
 
04:03:50.510 --> 04:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
or a gain but nobody loses dollars from
 
04:03:52.610 --> 04:03:52.620 align:start position:0%
that particular side of the formula that
 
04:03:54.229 --> 04:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
is that's correct okay just making sure
 
04:03:56.210 --> 04:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
again there are a lot of moving parts
 
04:03:57.769 --> 04:03:57.779 align:start position:0%
and I want to make sure they fall in the
 
04:03:58.670 --> 04:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
right place thank you and when you and
 
04:04:00.590 --> 04:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
when you look at 244 towns you always
 
04:04:02.929 --> 04:04:02.939 align:start position:0%
see something like that where one town
 
04:04:04.670 --> 04:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
will go we've never received a check
 
04:04:05.870 --> 04:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
from the state and then you change the
 
04:04:07.490 --> 04:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
formula just a little bit or a data
 
04:04:08.689 --> 04:04:08.699 align:start position:0%
point changes just a little bit and then
 
04:04:10.010 --> 04:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
they go okay what do I do with this
 
04:04:12.290 --> 04:04:12.300 align:start position:0%
check I've never received one uh let me
 
04:04:14.870 --> 04:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
tell book it here
 
04:04:19.550 --> 04:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:23.450 --> 04:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
this one the page uh page five
 
04:04:25.370 --> 04:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
so the governor makes changes to the
 
04:04:29.030 --> 04:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
formula that go beyond fiscal year 24
 
04:04:29.040 --> 04:04:30.769 align:start position:0%
formula that go beyond fiscal year 24
25.

04:04:30.769 --> 04:04:30.779 align:start position:0%
25.
 
04:04:34.729 --> 04:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
uh so 24 25 he's increasing That Base
 
04:04:37.250 --> 04:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
adequacy uh base adequacy just to start
 
04:04:39.229 --> 04:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
off 24 is increasing base adequacy Aid
 
04:04:41.750 --> 04:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh he's also increasing f r Aid he's
 
04:04:44.150 --> 04:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
also making that two percent adjustment
 
04:04:46.189 --> 04:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
each year so in your current law there's
 
04:04:48.170 --> 04:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
a CPR adjustment every two years he's
 
04:04:49.610 --> 04:04:49.620 align:start position:0%
making a two percent adjustment each
 
04:04:49.620 --> 04:04:50.809 align:start position:0%
making a two percent adjustment each
year

04:04:50.809 --> 04:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:04:52.729 --> 04:04:52.739 align:start position:0%
um so he isn't that's gonna have
 
04:04:54.469 --> 04:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
long-term effects um when you increase
 
04:04:55.910 --> 04:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
two percent each year each year each
 
04:04:56.929 --> 04:04:56.939 align:start position:0%
year each year it's going to increase
 
04:04:59.150 --> 04:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
the eight amount at a faster clip
 
04:05:02.570 --> 04:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
especially faster than every other year
 
04:05:02.580 --> 04:05:03.710 align:start position:0%
especially faster than every other year
um

04:05:03.710 --> 04:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:06.349 --> 04:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
he also is going to phase out that hold
 
04:05:09.070 --> 04:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
harmless Grant starting in fiscal year
 
04:05:12.889 --> 04:05:12.899 align:start position:0%
26. so starting in fiscal year 26 over a
 
04:05:15.830 --> 04:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
10-year period he is going to uh every
 
04:05:17.389 --> 04:05:17.399 align:start position:0%
two years going to reduce the hold
 
04:05:20.450 --> 04:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
harmless Grant by 20 percent
 
04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
as he's reducing the hold harmless Grant
 
04:05:25.370 --> 04:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
by 20 percent uh the proposed budget is
 
04:05:25.380 --> 04:05:26.570 align:start position:0%
by 20 percent uh the proposed budget is
also

04:05:26.570 --> 04:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:05:29.090 --> 04:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
uh increasing the extraordinary needs
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
Grant by 50 in the aid amount so I
 
04:05:34.670 --> 04:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
should have done the math I should have
 
04:05:36.410 --> 04:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
written out the math before
 
04:05:39.530 --> 04:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
um but if you do 650 times 50 percent
 
04:05:42.590 --> 04:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
it's like 900 something dollars
 
04:05:45.170 --> 04:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
um then you do 50 times that it's like
 
04:05:46.729 --> 04:05:46.739 align:start position:0%
twelve hundred dollars per F in our
 
04:05:48.950 --> 04:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
student and then 50 times that and so he
 
04:05:52.010 --> 04:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
does that through five iterations so the
 
04:05:54.650 --> 04:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
it's really difficult
 
04:05:56.990 --> 04:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
to predict the future
 
04:06:00.650 --> 04:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
um really difficult to to to to to know
 
04:06:01.790 --> 04:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
what what's gonna happen when student
 
04:06:04.910 --> 04:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
enrollment so just assuming
 
04:06:06.950 --> 04:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
a one percent enrollment decline which
 
04:06:09.110 --> 04:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
is actually pretty normal
 
04:06:10.370 --> 04:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
um covid we had a four percent
 
04:06:11.630 --> 04:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
enrollment decline
 
04:06:13.490 --> 04:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
um which was abnormal but normally we
 
04:06:15.590 --> 04:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
have a one percent enrollment decline
 
04:06:17.269 --> 04:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
um likely just based on demographic
 
04:06:17.279 --> 04:06:18.950 align:start position:0%
um likely just based on demographic
information

04:06:18.950 --> 04:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:06:21.290 --> 04:06:21.300 align:start position:0%
if you if you assume a one percent
 
04:06:22.849 --> 04:06:22.859 align:start position:0%
enrollment decline
 
04:06:25.729 --> 04:06:25.739 align:start position:0%
and you assume that Medicaid direct cert
 
04:06:27.950 --> 04:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
I believe that bill is in this committee
 
04:06:31.910 --> 04:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh Medicaid direct cert which uh will
 
04:06:34.010 --> 04:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
not be enacted it's not in hb2 and it
 
04:06:35.750 --> 04:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
will not be enacted unless the
 
04:06:38.150 --> 04:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
legislature enacts it um the department
 
04:06:39.469 --> 04:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
will not move forward with Medicaid
 
04:06:41.570 --> 04:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
direct cert but if we assume Medicaid
 
04:06:43.010 --> 04:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
direct assert is passed by the
 
04:06:44.330 --> 04:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
legislature and signed by the governor
 
04:06:47.210 --> 04:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
and is implemented in fiscal year 26
 
04:06:49.309 --> 04:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
which is when we hypothetically think we
 
04:06:51.290 --> 04:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
it would be implemented
 
04:06:53.510 --> 04:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
um if you make those assumptions and try
 
04:06:56.389 --> 04:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
to model out to the next 10 years
 
04:06:58.370 --> 04:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
basically what will happen is that hold
 
04:07:00.830 --> 04:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
harmless Grant and then we include the
 
04:07:02.210 --> 04:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
hold harmless Grant decreasing by 20
 
04:07:04.550 --> 04:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
each year and we include the
 
04:07:06.349 --> 04:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant increasing by
 
04:07:09.229 --> 04:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
50 parade Aid amount
 
04:07:11.510 --> 04:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
um over a 10-year period you'll kind of
 
04:07:15.469 --> 04:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
see what happens in the blue is base Aid
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
going up it's going up by two percent
 
04:07:21.050 --> 04:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
each year as the enrollment declines uh
 
04:07:22.610 --> 04:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
um it is still gonna
 
04:07:24.290 --> 04:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
if we assume a one percent enrollment
 
04:07:26.510 --> 04:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
decline that one percent two percent
 
04:07:29.150 --> 04:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
increase in base Aid is going to Eclipse
 
04:07:31.370 --> 04:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
that so just to go back to
 
04:07:34.070 --> 04:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative Heath's question
 
04:07:36.290 --> 04:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
when we look at
 
04:07:38.870 --> 04:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
the past with adequacy we we have our
 
04:07:40.670 --> 04:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
CPI adjustment every two years it's
 
04:07:43.370 --> 04:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
typically two percent we have in a one
 
04:07:46.010 --> 04:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
percent enrollment decline that really
 
04:07:49.130 --> 04:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
kind of holds districts flat and
 
04:07:51.110 --> 04:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
actually kind of has them lose money
 
04:07:52.309 --> 04:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
kind of in the long run especially
 
04:07:54.349 --> 04:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
during covet there was that 90 million
 
04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
dollar well it was based on one time
 
04:07:57.170 --> 04:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
made but there was a large shortfall
 
04:07:59.510 --> 04:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
when when the covert um when the coveted
 
04:08:02.150 --> 04:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
started impacting the adequacy formula
 
04:08:02.160 --> 04:08:03.349 align:start position:0%
started impacting the adequacy formula
um

04:08:03.349 --> 04:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:05.330 --> 04:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
so kind of just saying assuming one
 
04:08:06.889 --> 04:08:06.899 align:start position:0%
percent enrollment decline which is the
 
04:08:08.030 --> 04:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide average which will be
 
04:08:08.990 --> 04:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
different for each Community some
 
04:08:10.250 --> 04:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
communities have three percent some
 
04:08:12.830 --> 04:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
computers will increase students
 
04:08:12.840 --> 04:08:14.570 align:start position:0%
computers will increase students
um

04:08:14.570 --> 04:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:16.250 --> 04:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
it looks like the aid amount will
 
04:08:18.590 --> 04:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
increase overall
 
04:08:22.130 --> 04:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
um so this is just a Statewide average
 
04:08:24.290 --> 04:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
of what it will look like it will look
 
04:08:26.330 --> 04:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
like the increase in base adequacy Aid
 
04:08:28.189 --> 04:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
and the increase in extraordinary needs
 
04:08:29.809 --> 04:08:29.819 align:start position:0%
will kind of
 
04:08:32.090 --> 04:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
wash out the loss in the hold harmless
 
04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
Grant that's at a Statewide basis how it
 
04:08:37.010 --> 04:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
would shake out for each individual Town
 
04:08:39.469 --> 04:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
um depends but looking at the larger
 
04:08:42.110 --> 04:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide roll-up uh that's how it would
 
04:08:43.849 --> 04:08:43.859 align:start position:0%
shake out
 
04:08:46.429 --> 04:08:46.439 align:start position:0%
so that's that's what again based on all
 
04:08:47.689 --> 04:08:47.699 align:start position:0%
these assumptions based on Medicaid
 
04:08:49.670 --> 04:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
director being enacted based on a one
 
04:08:51.170 --> 04:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
percent enrollment decline
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
um based on what we think the data might
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
look like in the future
 
04:08:56.630 --> 04:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
kind of going to wash out there and what
 
04:08:57.830 --> 04:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
this also doesn't include is this
 
04:08:59.570 --> 04:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't also include the
 
04:09:01.070 --> 04:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
sped rate getting the two percent
 
04:09:03.410 --> 04:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
increase the ell rate getting the two
 
04:09:04.849 --> 04:09:04.859 align:start position:0%
percent increase
 
04:09:06.110 --> 04:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
um so that's going to give a little
 
04:09:07.550 --> 04:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
extra boost in this number in the long
 
04:09:07.560 --> 04:09:08.870 align:start position:0%
extra boost in this number in the long
term

04:09:08.870 --> 04:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
term
 
04:09:11.210 --> 04:09:11.220 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
kind of the the 10-year Outlook but when
 
04:09:16.070 --> 04:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
you have hb2 in front of you you will
 
04:09:17.809 --> 04:09:17.819 align:start position:0%
see that there is a hold harmless Grant
 
04:09:19.790 --> 04:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
hold harmless grant that phases out over
 
04:09:21.769 --> 04:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
10 years an extraordinary needs grant
 
04:09:24.650 --> 04:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
that increases for over a 10-year period
 
04:09:27.050 --> 04:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
every two years uh that's the changes in
 
04:09:30.290 --> 04:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
the formula that the governor has for 26
 
04:09:34.729 --> 04:09:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:37.429 --> 04:09:37.439 align:start position:0%
so the next page is whatever everyone
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
wants to see the town by town
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
so page six oh sorry
 
04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
just really quickly uh you don't need to
 
04:09:47.630 --> 04:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
go back to page five but just
 
04:09:50.630 --> 04:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that you know you guys had
 
04:09:52.070 --> 04:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
to um
 
04:09:54.889 --> 04:09:54.899 align:start position:0%
just show the top of the graph because I
 
04:09:56.330 --> 04:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
don't think they make paper that's quite
 
04:09:58.490 --> 04:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
big enough for us to see that detail if
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
you printed the whole thing but you know
 
04:10:02.809 --> 04:10:02.819 align:start position:0%
just wanted to note for the record that
 
04:10:04.429 --> 04:10:04.439 align:start position:0%
that's just the top of the graph so the
 
04:10:06.830 --> 04:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
changes are you know
 
04:10:10.010 --> 04:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
the exaggerated versus the total number
 
04:10:11.689 --> 04:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
yes so it's otherwise we wouldn't have
 
04:10:13.250 --> 04:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
seen anything meaningful so I know why
 
04:10:15.110 --> 04:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
you did it
 
04:10:17.689 --> 04:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
I just want to say that I've seen this
 
04:10:19.670 --> 04:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
hole will reduce the stabilization Grant
 
04:10:21.349 --> 04:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
in the past and you acknowledge that I'm
 
04:10:23.809 --> 04:10:23.819 align:start position:0%
kind of worry of 10 year plans
 
04:10:23.819 --> 04:10:25.309 align:start position:0%
kind of worry of 10 year plans
because

04:10:25.309 --> 04:10:25.319 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:10:26.929 --> 04:10:26.939 align:start position:0%
um you know born and raised in a
 
04:10:28.490 --> 04:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
communist country with our five-year
 
04:10:30.290 --> 04:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
plans they didn't really work that great
 
04:10:33.110 --> 04:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
for us so uh for now I'm just gonna look
 
04:10:34.910 --> 04:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
at it as what we are planning to do this
 
04:10:37.610 --> 04:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
biennium and not really spend a lot of
 
04:10:39.349 --> 04:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
time on the forecast because the
 
04:10:41.689 --> 04:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
forecast depends on future legislatures
 
04:10:44.809 --> 04:10:44.819 align:start position:0%
and you know whatever happens there so
 
04:10:48.830 --> 04:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
that yeah uh we we routinely do
 
04:10:51.410 --> 04:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
estimates for 10-year adequacy
 
04:10:54.050 --> 04:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
um and we say the uh the estimates are
 
04:10:55.790 --> 04:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
fine as long as no one looks at it in
 
04:10:57.429 --> 04:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
the in the future
 
04:11:00.290 --> 04:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
but yeah it's very difficult to um uh
 
04:11:01.969 --> 04:11:01.979 align:start position:0%
very difficult to estimate adequacy in
 
04:11:05.990 --> 04:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:08.570 --> 04:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
so the town by town
 
04:11:11.689 --> 04:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
so page six you'll see the state totals
 
04:11:12.830 --> 04:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
at the top
 
04:11:15.590 --> 04:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
so under current law uh fiscal year 24
 
04:11:17.330 --> 04:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
so if if
 
04:11:17.340 --> 04:11:19.189 align:start position:0%
so if if
if

04:11:19.189 --> 04:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature did nothing fiscal year
 
04:11:23.389 --> 04:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
24 would be current law which we
 
04:11:26.750 --> 04:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
estimate to be 962 million dollars and
 
04:11:28.189 --> 04:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
this is the town by town to how we got
 
04:11:29.330 --> 04:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
to that number
 
04:11:31.969 --> 04:11:31.979 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal year 24 Governors proposed the
 
04:11:33.849 --> 04:11:33.859 align:start position:0%
governor is is looking to increase
 
04:11:36.769 --> 04:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid at a Statewide basis by 54
 
04:11:38.929 --> 04:11:38.939 align:start position:0%
million dollars up to a billion 17
 
04:11:38.939 --> 04:11:40.849 align:start position:0%
million dollars up to a billion 17
million

04:11:40.849 --> 04:11:40.859 align:start position:0%
million
 
04:11:40.859 --> 04:11:41.389 align:start position:0%
million
um

04:11:41.389 --> 04:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:44.090 --> 04:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
and so you can see some towns
 
04:11:46.729 --> 04:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
um you can see a lot of hash marks uh
 
04:11:49.550 --> 04:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
dashes that's zero change they're
 
04:11:50.929 --> 04:11:50.939 align:start position:0%
getting the same amount they would under
 
04:11:52.670 --> 04:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
current law under the governor's
 
04:11:55.189 --> 04:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
proposed and so there's there's kind of
 
04:11:56.990 --> 04:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
two reasons for that really
 
04:11:58.370 --> 04:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
um you're either a whole harmless town
 
04:12:00.170 --> 04:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
so you're receiving a hold harmless
 
04:12:02.269 --> 04:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
Grant to hold harmless Grant holds you
 
04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
to what the current law estimate is so
 
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
it would exactly fall on the Zero
 
04:12:10.969 --> 04:12:10.979 align:start position:0%
um exactly be zero change
 
04:12:14.030 --> 04:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
if you are a community that
 
04:12:16.429 --> 04:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
is receiving additional funding it's
 
04:12:18.769 --> 04:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
because those changes in base adequacy
 
04:12:21.830 --> 04:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
Aid the change to up to 4 700 or the
 
04:12:24.950 --> 04:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
change up to 2500 in fnr in the rates
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
has worked out in a way that that either
 
04:12:30.050 --> 04:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
one eclipses whatever your stabilization
 
04:12:32.450 --> 04:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
was so it eclipses whatever moved away
 
04:12:34.610 --> 04:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
from the formula or you might not have
 
04:12:36.590 --> 04:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
been a stabilization town and it's just
 
04:12:39.170 --> 04:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
every dollar increases your adequacy Aid
 
04:12:41.090 --> 04:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
amount I mean you didn't have any loss
 
04:12:42.170 --> 04:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
on the right side of the formula you
 
04:12:43.490 --> 04:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
only had growth in the left side of the
 
04:12:43.500 --> 04:12:44.689 align:start position:0%
only had growth in the left side of the
formula

04:12:44.689 --> 04:12:44.699 align:start position:0%
formula
 
04:12:47.330 --> 04:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
um so this is the the town by Town
 
04:12:47.340 --> 04:12:48.590 align:start position:0%
um so this is the the town by Town
um

04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:50.030 --> 04:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
I think
 
04:12:51.530 --> 04:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to go through this
 
04:12:53.870 --> 04:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
document I don't if we have any
 
04:12:57.050 --> 04:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:59.450 --> 04:12:59.460 align:start position:0%
when you say stabilization we are
 
04:13:02.090 --> 04:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
talking about the governor's new
 
04:13:05.150 --> 04:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
proposed stabilization formula in in the
 
04:13:06.650 --> 04:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
context of the statement you just made
 
04:13:08.450 --> 04:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
oh that's no actually that's a good
 
04:13:10.729 --> 04:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
question so
 
04:13:12.950 --> 04:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
um stabilization sometimes sometimes
 
04:13:14.090 --> 04:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
it's called the whole harmless Grant
 
04:13:15.590 --> 04:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
when we say stable it just to get our
 
04:13:17.389 --> 04:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
jargon on the on the right terms here
 
04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about stabilization
 
04:13:21.889 --> 04:13:21.899 align:start position:0%
we are talking about the 2012 Grant the
 
04:13:23.330 --> 04:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
grant that's going away
 
04:13:25.010 --> 04:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about the governor's
 
04:13:28.130 --> 04:13:28.140 align:start position:0%
new hold harmless which is a a similar
 
04:13:29.330 --> 04:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
it's similar mechanically to
 
04:13:31.189 --> 04:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
stabilization it's different
 
04:13:32.870 --> 04:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
um we call it hold harmless so that's
 
04:13:33.889 --> 04:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
going to be just so we're on the same
 
04:13:37.790 --> 04:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
terms so every town with a zero with a
 
04:13:39.769 --> 04:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
no net change was in the old
 
04:13:42.710 --> 04:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
stabilization uh or some of them are
 
04:13:44.150 --> 04:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
excess swept so I was going to run
 
04:13:46.250 --> 04:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
through an example like Alton Alton is
 
04:13:47.570 --> 04:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
an excess I'm not going to jump ahead
 
04:13:56.030 --> 04:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:58.729 --> 04:13:58.739 align:start position:0%
up up on the town by town on page six
 
04:14:02.689 --> 04:14:02.699 align:start position:0%
I'll point you out uh to one scenario if
 
04:14:05.269 --> 04:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
you look at Bradford
 
04:14:08.389 --> 04:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
so it's location code
 
04:14:10.729 --> 04:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
let's see where it is location code 59
 
04:14:13.429 --> 04:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
it's in the middle of the sheep Bradford
 
04:14:16.849 --> 04:14:16.859 align:start position:0%
um their current law is 1.2 million
 
04:14:19.490 --> 04:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 24. the governor proposed
 
04:14:23.630 --> 04:14:23.640 align:start position:0%
is 1.2 million in fiscal year 24. and so
 
04:14:25.429 --> 04:14:25.439 align:start position:0%
they are
 
04:14:28.250 --> 04:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
um being they are stay or stabilization
 
04:14:31.790 --> 04:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
town uh even though the aid Ace uh base
 
04:14:33.590 --> 04:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
Aid has been increased even though fnr8
 
04:14:35.269 --> 04:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
has been increased it did not Eclipse
 
04:14:36.769 --> 04:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
whatever their stabilization they lost
 
04:14:40.189 --> 04:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
was so they are being Net Zero
 
04:14:40.199 --> 04:14:42.429 align:start position:0%
was so they are being Net Zero
ah

04:14:42.429 --> 04:14:42.439 align:start position:0%
ah
 
04:14:45.229 --> 04:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
where some communities like Bradford
 
04:14:47.330 --> 04:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
will start off as a whole harmless town
 
04:14:49.790 --> 04:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
will turn into not a whole harmless town
 
04:14:52.790 --> 04:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 24 so they were barely a
 
04:14:54.729 --> 04:14:54.739 align:start position:0%
whole harmless town and fiscal year 24
 
04:14:58.790 --> 04:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
but you had that two percent increase
 
04:14:58.800 --> 04:14:59.510 align:start position:0%
but you had that two percent increase
um

04:14:59.510 --> 04:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:01.550 --> 04:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh to base Aid so it's going to go from
 
04:15:03.130 --> 04:15:03.140 align:start position:0%
4 700 to
 
04:15:05.269 --> 04:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
4794 dollars
 
04:15:08.450 --> 04:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
um that little bump made them not a
 
04:15:10.490 --> 04:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
whole harmless town so some communities
 
04:15:12.290 --> 04:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
over time
 
04:15:14.929 --> 04:15:14.939 align:start position:0%
um this assumes flat enrollment
 
04:15:18.290 --> 04:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
um will will Eclipse their hold harmless
 
04:15:19.969 --> 04:15:19.979 align:start position:0%
um so Bradford is just one example if we
 
04:15:21.769 --> 04:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
assume flat enrollment
 
04:15:23.689 --> 04:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
um if Bradford had declining enrollment
 
04:15:26.269 --> 04:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
they might not if they have declining
 
04:15:27.469 --> 04:15:27.479 align:start position:0%
enrollment next year they might not
 
04:15:29.809 --> 04:15:29.819 align:start position:0%
Eclipse their hold harmless Grant
 
04:15:31.610 --> 04:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
um so just so you know that predicting
 
04:15:32.870 --> 04:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
the future how the variables will play
 
04:15:34.550 --> 04:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
out in the future really depend on a lot
 
04:15:37.490 --> 04:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
of variables really what was your what's
 
04:15:39.349 --> 04:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
the size of your whole harmless Grant
 
04:15:42.110 --> 04:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
what's the size of what's your
 
04:15:44.030 --> 04:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment situation so declining
 
04:15:44.040 --> 04:15:45.469 align:start position:0%
enrollment situation so declining
enrollment

04:15:45.469 --> 04:15:45.479 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
04:15:48.830 --> 04:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
um uh the two percent bump it is going
 
04:15:50.150 --> 04:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
to help you out but if you have
 
04:15:51.530 --> 04:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
significant declining enrollment it's
 
04:15:52.849 --> 04:15:52.859 align:start position:0%
probably not going to help you Eclipse
 
04:15:54.590 --> 04:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
whatever your stabilization was and
 
04:15:55.849 --> 04:15:55.859 align:start position:0%
we'll run through some scenarios but
 
04:15:57.469 --> 04:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
some some communities uh have a really
 
04:15:59.150 --> 04:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
high hold harmless that if you kind of
 
04:16:01.010 --> 04:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
look at the math and you kind of look
 
04:16:03.170 --> 04:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
forward they're probably it's very
 
04:16:04.550 --> 04:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
unlikely they're going to Eclipse their
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
hold harmless
 
04:16:08.030 --> 04:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
um but certain communities they might
 
04:16:10.490 --> 04:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
seem like a whole harmless town now but
 
04:16:12.349 --> 04:16:12.359 align:start position:0%
in the future depending on how their
 
04:16:14.210 --> 04:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
enrollment is if they're enrollment's
 
04:16:15.469 --> 04:16:15.479 align:start position:0%
stable and they're just getting a two
 
04:16:17.210 --> 04:16:17.220 align:start position:0%
percent bump in their base rate they're
 
04:16:19.189 --> 04:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
likely going to you know maybe Eclipse
 
04:16:20.630 --> 04:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
their hold harmless
 
04:16:22.490 --> 04:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
um also if they're an extraordinary
 
04:16:24.769 --> 04:16:24.779 align:start position:0%
needs Grand town so in the future I know
 
04:16:26.570 --> 04:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
we're not we're talking about staying to
 
04:16:28.550 --> 04:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
the 24 25 budget but just to talk about
 
04:16:31.849 --> 04:16:31.859 align:start position:0%
the long-term trends of what is in hb2
 
04:16:33.290 --> 04:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
um those were the factors that would
 
04:16:36.410 --> 04:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:41.389 --> 04:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr just again trying to
 
04:16:43.429 --> 04:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
translate this into English so I can
 
04:16:44.870 --> 04:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
make sure I really understood it
 
04:16:47.990 --> 04:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
correctly the governors proposed
 
04:16:50.330 --> 04:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
approached over the long term to uh you
 
04:16:51.769 --> 04:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
know cleaning up the formal
 
04:16:55.790 --> 04:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
stabilization you know distortions if
 
04:16:59.689 --> 04:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
is to essentially you know create their
 
04:17:01.610 --> 04:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
hold harmless which make sure nobody
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
loses a dollar and over time kind of
 
04:17:07.070 --> 04:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
hold the towns that used to be in
 
04:17:09.410 --> 04:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
stabilization flat while everybody else
 
04:17:12.469 --> 04:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
is catching up so that nobody has to
 
04:17:14.570 --> 04:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
have funds taken away from them but the
 
04:17:17.090 --> 04:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
towns that we're getting what one could
 
04:17:19.130 --> 04:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
characterize as excess funds because of
 
04:17:21.710 --> 04:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
the old stabilization would just grow a
 
04:17:23.929 --> 04:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
bit slower until everybody caught up I'm
 
04:17:25.969 --> 04:17:25.979 align:start position:0%
just trying to again wrap my head around
 
04:17:27.650 --> 04:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
it and make sure I understand the
 
04:17:29.450 --> 04:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
internet I guess another way of asking
 
04:17:31.849 --> 04:17:31.859 align:start position:0%
this would be through the whole plan
 
04:17:35.150 --> 04:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
forecast of the governor will a town
 
04:17:37.309 --> 04:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
that's currently in stabilization will
 
04:17:38.990 --> 04:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
is it ever a scenario where they could
 
04:17:42.590 --> 04:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
lose dollars yes okay so the hold
 
04:17:44.530 --> 04:17:44.540 align:start position:0%
harmless so they're held harmless in
 
04:17:47.389 --> 04:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
24-25 so there's no situation that they
 
04:17:49.670 --> 04:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
could lose money in 24.25 because
 
04:17:52.250 --> 04:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
they're held harmless but 26 and Beyond
 
04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh there is a phase out of the hold
 
04:17:56.210 --> 04:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
harmless so
 
04:17:58.130 --> 04:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
if you decrease your hold harmless Grant
 
04:18:00.290 --> 04:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
by 20 percent
 
04:18:02.630 --> 04:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
um you in in whatever you're seeing in
 
04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
that CPI increase that two percent
 
04:18:06.349 --> 04:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
increase the extraordinary needs it may
 
04:18:08.450 --> 04:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
or may not eclipse the loss you're
 
04:18:10.189 --> 04:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
experiencing I appreciate your
 
04:18:11.689 --> 04:18:11.699 align:start position:0%
clarification as you said there are a
 
04:18:13.969 --> 04:18:13.979 align:start position:0%
lot of moving Parts 26 and Beyond so so
 
04:18:15.469 --> 04:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
some communities are going to be able to
 
04:18:17.330 --> 04:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
Eclipse it some communities uh based on
 
04:18:19.130 --> 04:18:19.140 align:start position:0%
the math very likely will not Eclipse it
 
04:18:20.929 --> 04:18:20.939 align:start position:0%
much appreciated I think if you look at
 
04:18:23.389 --> 04:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
your chart on page five it's fairly
 
04:18:28.670 --> 04:18:28.680 align:start position:0%
obvious that the 20 uh FY 26 bar in
 
04:18:31.090 --> 04:18:31.100 align:start position:0%
total is shorter yes
 
04:18:33.710 --> 04:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
04:18:35.330 --> 04:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
um yeah sorry you don't have hb2 in
 
04:18:38.150 --> 04:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
front of you but um starting in 26 you
 
04:18:40.370 --> 04:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
see that 20 decline in the hold harmless
 
04:18:40.380 --> 04:18:41.929 align:start position:0%
see that 20 decline in the hold harmless
Grant

04:18:41.929 --> 04:18:41.939 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
04:18:44.330 --> 04:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
um and so 26 20 decline in the hold
 
04:18:45.769 --> 04:18:45.779 align:start position:0%
harmless Grant
 
04:18:48.889 --> 04:18:48.899 align:start position:0%
um uh and then no change basically you
 
04:18:50.990 --> 04:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
hold that basically you hold 80 of your
 
04:18:52.670 --> 04:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
hold armless grant for
 
04:18:54.590 --> 04:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year 27.
 
04:18:56.510 --> 04:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
um in fiscal year 26 also you see the
 
04:18:58.490 --> 04:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
the Boost to extraordinary needs Grant
 
04:19:01.010 --> 04:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
so the a per pupil and that one is 900
 
04:19:03.110 --> 04:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
900 something dollars
 
04:19:04.969 --> 04:19:04.979 align:start position:0%
um per fnr pupil
 
04:19:04.979 --> 04:19:06.349 align:start position:0%
um per fnr pupil
um

04:19:06.349 --> 04:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:09.170 --> 04:19:09.180 align:start position:0%
so yeah when you look at 26 you'll see
 
04:19:12.050 --> 04:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
the first reduction on page five when
 
04:19:13.550 --> 04:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
you look at 26 you see the first
 
04:19:15.530 --> 04:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
reduction in the brown bar which is hold
 
04:19:15.540 --> 04:19:17.150 align:start position:0%
reduction in the brown bar which is hold
harmless

04:19:17.150 --> 04:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
harmless
 
04:19:21.410 --> 04:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
some of that is also um uh
 
04:19:24.229 --> 04:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
a boost to it's also when we assume
 
04:19:25.490 --> 04:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
that's when we start that's without a
 
04:19:26.870 --> 04:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
plugged in Medicaid direct cert numbers
 
04:19:28.969 --> 04:19:28.979 align:start position:0%
Medicaid directs certain numbers which
 
04:19:31.910 --> 04:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh the estimate could be anywhere to 9
 
04:19:34.729 --> 04:19:34.739 align:start position:0%
000 additional uh f r students to 18 000
 
04:19:36.170 --> 04:19:36.180 align:start position:0%
it's that's another
 
04:19:38.570 --> 04:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
very hard variable to predict
 
04:19:42.110 --> 04:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
um uh it could add 22 million to 42
 
04:19:43.429 --> 04:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
million under current law to the
 
04:19:44.750 --> 04:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula
 
04:19:46.070 --> 04:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
um I think it's probably closer to the
 
04:19:48.650 --> 04:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
22 million side but that's another
 
04:19:50.570 --> 04:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
another thing in the future that's going
 
04:19:52.670 --> 04:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
to be hard to predict
 
04:19:54.950 --> 04:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you can we put Medicaid direct
 
04:19:59.090 --> 04:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:02.450 --> 04:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
yes you can so
 
04:20:06.469 --> 04:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
House Bill six ten 601 oh 601 right yeah
 
04:20:07.910 --> 04:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
so that that we have a work session
 
04:20:09.530 --> 04:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
scheduled for Tuesday
 
04:20:11.510 --> 04:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh to discuss that and similar to the
 
04:20:13.250 --> 04:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
other bills we've retained that could be
 
04:20:14.990 --> 04:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
something since it directly impacts the
 
04:20:17.030 --> 04:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh calculation of adequacy I would
 
04:20:18.769 --> 04:20:18.779 align:start position:0%
recommend that be part of Hospital too
 
04:20:20.990 --> 04:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:20:21.000 --> 04:20:21.950 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:20:21.950 --> 04:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:21.960 --> 04:20:23.990 align:start position:0%
um
529

04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
529
 
04:20:28.250 --> 04:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
didn't did we get 529 yet or
 
04:20:30.229 --> 04:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
it's individual
 
04:20:33.110 --> 04:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's our it's came to us from the floor
 
04:20:35.269 --> 04:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
so that's another funding bill
 
04:20:36.889 --> 04:20:36.899 align:start position:0%
do you have we run the numbers on that
 
04:20:36.899 --> 04:20:38.590 align:start position:0%
do you have we run the numbers on that
one

04:20:38.590 --> 04:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:20:41.030 --> 04:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
95 million dollars
 
04:20:43.130 --> 04:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
95. representative fellows around the
 
04:20:44.389 --> 04:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
numbers I double checked them because
 
04:20:46.150 --> 04:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
I'm in a whole job
 
04:20:48.769 --> 04:20:48.779 align:start position:0%
she sent me her numbers did I send them
 
04:20:49.849 --> 04:20:49.859 align:start position:0%
to you Mickey
 
04:20:50.590 --> 04:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
yes we
 
04:20:50.600 --> 04:20:52.070 align:start position:0%
yes we
[Music]

04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you could we get a print out
 
04:20:56.689 --> 04:20:56.699 align:start position:0%
of those then at some point
 
04:20:56.699 --> 04:20:58.610 align:start position:0%
of those then at some point
no

04:20:58.610 --> 04:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:20:58.620 --> 04:21:00.290 align:start position:0%
no
what

04:21:00.290 --> 04:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:21:03.530 --> 04:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
was that uh Representatives fellows ran
 
04:21:03.540 --> 04:21:04.849 align:start position:0%
was that uh Representatives fellows ran
uh

04:21:04.849 --> 04:21:04.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:21:08.990 --> 04:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
data sheet on um House Bill 529
 
04:21:11.210 --> 04:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
that some of us have
 
04:21:14.990 --> 04:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
seen but not all of us so I think Mickey
 
04:21:17.210 --> 04:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
has a copy of it
 
04:21:18.769 --> 04:21:18.779 align:start position:0%
we do so we have the work session
 
04:21:20.030 --> 04:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
scheduled for that as well on Tuesday
 
04:21:23.150 --> 04:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
perfect so we can bring that print out
 
04:21:24.229 --> 04:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
if you want we don't have a fiscal note
 
04:21:27.110 --> 04:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
on that bill yet you said 529. so we
 
04:21:28.610 --> 04:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
don't have anything official from the
 
04:21:30.410 --> 04:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
Department I think Mark said he had
 
04:21:32.150 --> 04:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
double check that word so we have lots
 
04:21:34.250 --> 04:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
of options what's your relation to
 
04:21:37.189 --> 04:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
Logistics additional eight grants for
 
04:21:39.170 --> 04:21:39.180 align:start position:0%
school based on free and reduced price
 
04:21:42.950 --> 04:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
meals and fiscal capacity disparity
 
04:21:49.010 --> 04:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:51.050 --> 04:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
so if if I was just going to go through
 
04:21:53.030 --> 04:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
this document really hard unless anyone
 
04:21:57.050 --> 04:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:59.269 --> 04:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
I kind of interrupted you when you were
 
04:22:01.030 --> 04:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
going through the original you know
 
04:22:03.469 --> 04:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
example were there other examples you
 
04:22:04.849 --> 04:22:04.859 align:start position:0%
were going to go through or did the
 
04:22:06.530 --> 04:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
discussion after replace the need for
 
04:22:08.330 --> 04:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
the other towns you were I was going to
 
04:22:09.710 --> 04:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
try to do it through this document it's
 
04:22:13.370 --> 04:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
very hard to read I apologize my uh so
 
04:22:14.570 --> 04:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
one of the tricks here when you're
 
04:22:15.889 --> 04:22:15.899 align:start position:0%
looking at adequacy spreadsheet is if
 
04:22:17.269 --> 04:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
you pulled up the bottom you can usually
 
04:22:19.910 --> 04:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
line it up with uh line it up with a
 
04:22:19.920 --> 04:22:21.650 align:start position:0%
line it up with uh line it up with a
town

04:22:21.650 --> 04:22:21.660 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:22:23.150 --> 04:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
um so we'll start with Acworth Acworth
 
04:22:25.729 --> 04:22:25.739 align:start position:0%
is the top town here so this is just the
 
04:22:27.110 --> 04:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
governor's formula in the the
 
04:22:29.090 --> 04:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet format the format that um
 
04:22:32.809 --> 04:22:32.819 align:start position:0%
that uh the saus would receive this as
 
04:22:34.490 --> 04:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
if this became law
 
04:22:37.670 --> 04:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
um so Acworth has 87 students 87 times
 
04:22:40.610 --> 04:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
the 47 uh four thousand seven hundred
 
04:22:44.689 --> 04:22:44.699 align:start position:0%
dollars gets you 408 000 F and R we're
 
04:22:46.790 --> 04:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
estimating them to have 28 f r students
 
04:22:49.070 --> 04:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
times the 2500
 
04:22:51.830 --> 04:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
that gets a seventy thousand dollars
 
04:22:54.790 --> 04:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
sped no changes there 19 students times
 
04:22:58.790 --> 04:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
2079 we get the 39 000 amount they do
 
04:23:00.349 --> 04:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
not have any English language Learners
 
04:23:04.910 --> 04:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
in Acworth so no age no Aid there the
 
04:23:06.349 --> 04:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
governor now has taken out the third
 
04:23:07.670 --> 04:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
grade component the third grade
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
component is usually in the adequacy
 
04:23:11.990 --> 04:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet we get the total cost of an
 
04:23:15.229 --> 04:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
adequate education it's 518 000 under
 
04:23:18.229 --> 04:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
the governor's formula we subtract swept
 
04:23:20.689 --> 04:23:20.699 align:start position:0%
so it looks like we need around three
 
04:23:22.610 --> 04:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars at a minimum in
 
04:23:25.250 --> 04:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
a check cut from the state to make sure
 
04:23:27.349 --> 04:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
the three hundred thousand dollars plus
 
04:23:30.650 --> 04:23:30.660 align:start position:0%
the swept of 221 000 would get them
 
04:23:32.750 --> 04:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
approximately that five hundred and
 
04:23:34.550 --> 04:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
eighteen thousand dollars they need to
 
04:23:36.410 --> 04:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
fund their schools uh to provide the
 
04:23:38.510 --> 04:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
04:23:43.670 --> 04:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
so for Acworth um we do 518k minus 221 k
 
04:23:46.189 --> 04:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
then we add their extraordinary needs
 
04:23:47.330 --> 04:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
Grant they have a very small
 
04:23:48.950 --> 04:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant fourteen
 
04:23:51.469 --> 04:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
04:23:51.479 --> 04:23:52.610 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
um

04:23:52.610 --> 04:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:56.510 --> 04:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh by the way also in hb2 uh you'll see
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
this when you get hp2 uh
 
04:24:01.250 --> 04:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
any Community that's receiving less than
 
04:24:02.570 --> 04:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars in extraordinary
 
04:24:03.950 --> 04:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
needs Grant doesn't need to do an
 
04:24:05.450 --> 04:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
accountability plan so that was
 
04:24:07.550 --> 04:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
something so it just exempts any small
 
04:24:09.110 --> 04:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
any grant that any small grants are
 
04:24:10.429 --> 04:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
exempt from doing an accountability plan
 
04:24:12.290 --> 04:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
so Acworth doesn't have to do an
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
accountability plan on a fourteen
 
04:24:15.650 --> 04:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar Grant
 
04:24:15.660 --> 04:24:17.929 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar Grant
um

04:24:17.929 --> 04:24:17.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:19.790 --> 04:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh we tally that up um it actually
 
04:24:24.429 --> 04:24:24.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't 300K it was 298k 200 2 000 uh 298
 
04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
584 that's their preliminary Grant
 
04:24:29.150 --> 04:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
that's the cost of an adequate education
 
04:24:31.370 --> 04:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
minus swept plus the extraordinary needs
 
04:24:31.380 --> 04:24:32.510 align:start position:0%
minus swept plus the extraordinary needs
Grant

04:24:32.510 --> 04:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
04:24:34.849 --> 04:24:34.859 align:start position:0%
um but then here fiscal year 24 the
 
04:24:36.110 --> 04:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
brown column
 
04:24:38.090 --> 04:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
that is the hold harmless we're holding
 
04:24:39.650 --> 04:24:39.660 align:start position:0%
them to we're holding them to what does
 
04:24:43.429 --> 04:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
24 current law say and so it says 469
 
04:24:43.439 --> 04:24:44.330 align:start position:0%
24 current law say and so it says 469
000.

04:24:44.330 --> 04:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
000.
 
04:24:47.450 --> 04:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
so uh they are going to be held harmless
 
04:24:53.269 --> 04:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
to that uh the uh so if you have 298 000
 
04:24:55.550 --> 04:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
you plus a hundred and seventy thousand
 
04:24:58.790 --> 04:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
you get them back up to that 469 000. so
 
04:25:00.769 --> 04:25:00.779 align:start position:0%
this is just one Community where the
 
04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
whole harmless Grant is pretty
 
04:25:01.920 --> 04:25:03.110 align:start position:0%
whole harmless Grant is pretty
substantial

04:25:03.110 --> 04:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
04:25:04.610 --> 04:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
um if Acworth were to grow their
 
04:25:04.620 --> 04:25:06.050 align:start position:0%
um if Acworth were to grow their
population

04:25:06.050 --> 04:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:25:06.060 --> 04:25:07.610 align:start position:0%
population
um

04:25:07.610 --> 04:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:09.830 --> 04:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
they might be held harmless in the
 
04:25:11.330 --> 04:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
future meaning they might have enough
 
04:25:13.610 --> 04:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
Aid in the future to Eclipse their their
 
04:25:16.729 --> 04:25:16.739 align:start position:0%
current uh hold homeless Grant
 
04:25:19.130 --> 04:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
um that's again talking about 26 and
 
04:25:21.969 --> 04:25:21.979 align:start position:0%
Beyond but for fiscal year 24 and 25
 
04:25:25.309 --> 04:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
they are going to receive 469 000
 
04:25:28.429 --> 04:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
inadequacy Grant no matter what
 
04:25:31.550 --> 04:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
um no matter how at a minimum sorry not
 
04:25:33.889 --> 04:25:33.899 align:start position:0%
no matter what at a minimum so we have
 
04:25:35.630 --> 04:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
the hundred and seventy thousand
 
04:25:38.090 --> 04:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
plus the 298 000 and the preliminary
 
04:25:41.389 --> 04:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
Grant and we get a number of uh 469 000.
 
04:25:43.429 --> 04:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
so that is how a hold harmless Grant
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
Works flows through the spreadsheet
 
04:25:48.469 --> 04:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
now going further I'm going to pick on
 
04:25:50.210 --> 04:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
Amherst because Amherst was I think the
 
04:25:52.429 --> 04:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
first community that received additional
 
04:25:52.439 --> 04:25:54.349 align:start position:0%
first community that received additional
Aid

04:25:54.349 --> 04:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
Aid
 
04:25:58.670 --> 04:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:01.969 --> 04:26:01.979 align:start position:0%
let's see Amherst yep it's location code
 
04:26:01.979 --> 04:26:04.729 align:start position:0%
let's see Amherst yep it's location code
17

04:26:04.729 --> 04:26:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:06.670 --> 04:26:06.680 align:start position:0%
so Amherst has
 
04:26:08.750 --> 04:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
1795 students
 
04:26:10.670 --> 04:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
times that by the base adequacy eight
 
04:26:13.309 --> 04:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
amount we get 8.4 million
 
04:26:16.130 --> 04:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
they have 106 f r students times that by
 
04:26:17.809 --> 04:26:17.819 align:start position:0%
the twenty five hundred dollars we get
 
04:26:17.819 --> 04:26:20.030 align:start position:0%
the twenty five hundred dollars we get
263k

04:26:20.030 --> 04:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
263k
 
04:26:24.889 --> 04:26:24.899 align:start position:0%
sped 290 times the 2079 603
 
04:26:27.950 --> 04:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
English language Learners 13 times 756
 
04:26:30.710 --> 04:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
we get the 9787.
 
04:26:32.689 --> 04:26:32.699 align:start position:0%
now we got the total cost of inadequate
 
04:26:35.389 --> 04:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
education for them is 9.3 million
 
04:26:38.210 --> 04:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
uh minus the swept so that will come
 
04:26:39.769 --> 04:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
into play and minus the swept ends up
 
04:26:42.050 --> 04:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
being 5.7 million
 
04:26:43.729 --> 04:26:43.739 align:start position:0%
um so the cost of an adequate education
 
04:26:47.990 --> 04:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
is 9.3 million swept is 3.5 million so
 
04:26:50.330 --> 04:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
they're not an access web Community they
 
04:26:52.610 --> 04:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
are not an extraordinary needs Grant
 
04:26:52.620 --> 04:26:53.689 align:start position:0%
are not an extraordinary needs Grant
Community

04:26:53.689 --> 04:26:53.699 align:start position:0%
Community
 
04:26:55.849 --> 04:26:55.859 align:start position:0%
their Grant at a minimum is looking to
 
04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
be at least 5.7 million we look at what
 
04:27:01.070 --> 04:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
they were good under current law it's
 
04:27:04.729 --> 04:27:04.739 align:start position:0%
4.2 million so they don't need to hold
 
04:27:05.870 --> 04:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
harmless Grant because what they're
 
04:27:07.250 --> 04:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
receiving under the governor's formula
 
04:27:08.630 --> 04:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
is greater than what they would receive
 
04:27:10.729 --> 04:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
under current law so no hold harmless
 
04:27:14.090 --> 04:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
Grant is needed so they receive a uh
 
04:27:17.870 --> 04:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
adequacy Grant of 5.7 million when you
 
04:27:20.630 --> 04:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
add in the stabilization swept Grant
 
04:27:22.849 --> 04:27:22.859 align:start position:0%
uh start not added stabilization I'm
 
04:27:24.050 --> 04:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
sorry add in the Swift Grant plus the
 
04:27:27.050 --> 04:27:27.060 align:start position:0%
adequacy grant we get 9.3 million so
 
04:27:28.910 --> 04:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
that's an that's how a non-hold harmless
 
04:27:31.490 --> 04:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
would would work out and why is Amherst
 
04:27:33.110 --> 04:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
a non-hold harmless well it could be a
 
04:27:35.149 --> 04:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
lot of reasons the likely reason is they
 
04:27:37.610 --> 04:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
were not a stabilization town or if they
 
04:27:39.889 --> 04:27:39.899 align:start position:0%
are a stabilization town the increase in
 
04:27:42.349 --> 04:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
base adequacy and f r adequacy eclipses
 
04:27:45.170 --> 04:27:45.180 align:start position:0%
whatever the stabilization was so that
 
04:27:48.530 --> 04:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
is how the formula works for
 
04:27:50.870 --> 04:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
um around around half of the communities
 
04:27:52.309 --> 04:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
are like Amherst where they're receiving
 
04:27:54.649 --> 04:27:54.659 align:start position:0%
around 100 communities so a little less
 
04:27:56.510 --> 04:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
than half are around the are similar to
 
04:27:57.469 --> 04:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
Amherst where they're receiving
 
04:28:00.410 --> 04:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
additional Aid through the formula
 
04:28:03.950 --> 04:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
and then I Alton is I'll go up to Alton
 
04:28:06.110 --> 04:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
and this is the other scenario
 
04:28:09.170 --> 04:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
Alton it's a location code 15.
 
04:28:12.170 --> 04:28:12.180 align:start position:0%
uh six one from the top
 
04:28:15.110 --> 04:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
so Alton has 576 kids and I'll go
 
04:28:16.189 --> 04:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
through this a little bit quicker here
 
04:28:18.290 --> 04:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
but if we scroll over to their cost of
 
04:28:20.689 --> 04:28:20.699 align:start position:0%
inadequate education Alton's cost of an
 
04:28:23.269 --> 04:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
adequate education is 3.2 million their
 
04:28:26.750 --> 04:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
swept is 3.7 million so they don't need
 
04:28:28.189 --> 04:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
additional funding because they have
 
04:28:30.110 --> 04:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
enough money through their swept to
 
04:28:31.670 --> 04:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of an adequate education
 
04:28:33.710 --> 04:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
so their cost of an adequate education
 
04:28:36.050 --> 04:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
previously was something less than 3.2
 
04:28:36.060 --> 04:28:37.250 align:start position:0%
previously was something less than 3.2
million

04:28:37.250 --> 04:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
million
 
04:28:37.260 --> 04:28:38.330 align:start position:0%
million
um

04:28:38.330 --> 04:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:39.649 --> 04:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
um but whatever increases they've got on
 
04:28:41.809 --> 04:28:41.819 align:start position:0%
base rate and fnr did not make them
 
04:28:43.729 --> 04:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
greater than swept so they they did not
 
04:28:46.189 --> 04:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
become a an adequacy Town they're still
 
04:28:49.370 --> 04:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
just an excess webtown so no changes in
 
04:28:51.649 --> 04:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
their funding formula so they're held
 
04:28:53.510 --> 04:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
they're held neutral but not held
 
04:28:55.429 --> 04:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
harmless there's all there's towns
 
04:28:57.170 --> 04:28:57.180 align:start position:0%
getting additional Aid Town's getting uh
 
04:28:58.670 --> 04:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
held harmless and towns just sort of
 
04:29:00.410 --> 04:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
being held neutral
 
04:29:11.210 --> 04:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:11.220 --> 04:29:19.670 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:29:19.670 --> 04:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:22.250 --> 04:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
I think it's a lot to digest all the the
 
04:29:24.170 --> 04:29:24.180 align:start position:0%
numbers and the three different kinds of
 
04:29:25.969 --> 04:29:25.979 align:start position:0%
categories of how this could affect your
 
04:29:27.349 --> 04:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
town you know whether or not you're
 
04:29:28.729 --> 04:29:28.739 align:start position:0%
neutral whether or not you're better off
 
04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
and whether or not you're taking
 
04:29:32.030 --> 04:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
advantage of this hold harmless period
 
04:29:34.550 --> 04:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
of time I think um it'll be interesting
 
04:29:37.250 --> 04:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
to to see the Shakedown of how this
 
04:29:39.349 --> 04:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
affects people across the state and you
 
04:29:41.630 --> 04:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
know how they might feel about that so
 
04:29:43.910 --> 04:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
well one thing's for sure you'll hear
 
04:29:47.870 --> 04:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:49.550 --> 04:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
other question mark I just want to say
 
04:29:52.849 --> 04:29:52.859 align:start position:0%
thank you this is a an amazing amazing
 
04:29:55.429 --> 04:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
amazing amount of work and I I bet you
 
04:29:57.469 --> 04:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
were up late a lot of nights and all the
 
04:29:58.969 --> 04:29:58.979 align:start position:0%
people from the Department I want to
 
04:30:00.349 --> 04:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
thank you all because they're just
 
04:30:01.849 --> 04:30:01.859 align:start position:0%
amazing all the work that you do thank
 
04:30:01.859 --> 04:30:04.010 align:start position:0%
amazing all the work that you do thank
you

04:30:04.010 --> 04:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:30:06.410 --> 04:30:06.420 align:start position:0%
and just a very quick thought for
 
04:30:09.290 --> 04:30:09.300 align:start position:0%
everybody involved
 
04:30:10.969 --> 04:30:10.979 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to be happy this
 
04:30:14.990 --> 04:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
biennium right it's a uh no no loss or
 
04:30:17.750 --> 04:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
get extra funding the reason why I was
 
04:30:19.969 --> 04:30:19.979 align:start position:0%
asking about when does the pain start is
 
04:30:23.510 --> 04:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
that I would rather make sure as much as
 
04:30:26.689 --> 04:30:26.699 align:start position:0%
possible that the people who may see
 
04:30:29.210 --> 04:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
their funding drop talk about this now
 
04:30:31.250 --> 04:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
rather than wait for two years until
 
04:30:33.830 --> 04:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
their funding starts dropping and then
 
04:30:36.710 --> 04:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
complain at the last moment so
 
04:30:39.530 --> 04:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
whatever we can do you know at every
 
04:30:42.110 --> 04:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
level to inform the school districts of
 
04:30:45.410 --> 04:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
you know what is going on so we can get
 
04:30:47.689 --> 04:30:47.699 align:start position:0%
feedback now it would be valued rather
 
04:30:51.110 --> 04:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
than uh you know having a surprise quote
 
04:30:53.570 --> 04:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
unquote and then a knee-jerk reaction in
 
04:30:56.210 --> 04:30:56.220 align:start position:0%
two years so
 
04:30:56.220 --> 04:30:58.550 align:start position:0%
two years so
joke

04:30:58.550 --> 04:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
joke
 
04:31:00.349 --> 04:31:00.359 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you yeah I think this is the
 
04:31:03.110 --> 04:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
best job I've seen yet so thank you
 
04:31:03.120 --> 04:31:05.750 align:start position:0%
best job I've seen yet so thank you
uh

04:31:05.750 --> 04:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:31:08.570 --> 04:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
I was looking at Farmington and uh it
 
04:31:10.910 --> 04:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
kind of it's kind of flat
 
04:31:13.370 --> 04:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
but stable the stabilization's been
 
04:31:16.670 --> 04:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
tried before to get rid of it and uh it
 
04:31:19.130 --> 04:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
worked for what couple
 
04:31:22.550 --> 04:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:25.849 --> 04:31:25.859 align:start position:0%
I think 2017 2018 2019 yeah so three
 
04:31:27.530 --> 04:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
years so farmington's stabilization
 
04:31:29.689 --> 04:31:29.699 align:start position:0%
right large stabilization and it doesn't
 
04:31:31.729 --> 04:31:31.739 align:start position:0%
make any I mean I shouldn't be saying
 
04:31:33.769 --> 04:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
this but it doesn't make any sense
 
04:31:38.689 --> 04:31:38.699 align:start position:0%
keep getting it thank you Mr chairman
 
04:31:41.450 --> 04:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
so we keep putting free and reduced in
 
04:31:43.849 --> 04:31:43.859 align:start position:0%
the same category what's the difference
 
04:31:46.849 --> 04:31:46.859 align:start position:0%
in incomes whether you get free meal or
 
04:31:49.670 --> 04:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:52.130 --> 04:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know if someone has the
 
04:31:53.750 --> 04:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
um actual income amounts but it's a
 
04:31:55.910 --> 04:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
hundred and thirty five percent for free
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
in 185 percent of the federal poverty
 
04:32:00.530 --> 04:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
guideline for reduced
 
04:32:02.929 --> 04:32:02.939 align:start position:0%
so adequacy only cares about um if
 
04:32:04.849 --> 04:32:04.859 align:start position:0%
you're 185 or under
 
04:32:08.689 --> 04:32:08.699 align:start position:0%
um 185 or under under the uh reduce 130.
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
130 is free
 
04:32:11.929 --> 04:32:11.939 align:start position:0%
um 130 is free but for the purpose of
 
04:32:13.250 --> 04:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
adequacy only the only number that
 
04:32:16.010 --> 04:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
matters is under 185 percent
 
04:32:19.969 --> 04:32:19.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:27.889 --> 04:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:29.450 --> 04:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
no other questions thank you very much
 
04:32:31.010 --> 04:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
04:32:31.020 --> 04:32:35.510 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
sure

04:32:35.510 --> 04:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:37.010 --> 04:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
that's good you've got to come up to the
 
04:32:37.020 --> 04:32:39.530 align:start position:0%
that's good you've got to come up to the
mic

04:32:39.530 --> 04:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:41.809 --> 04:32:41.819 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair Dave luno
 
04:32:43.910 --> 04:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
from education I was just wondering if
 
04:32:45.769 --> 04:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
if Mark could talk a little bit about
 
04:32:49.670 --> 04:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
the um the the the the second most um
 
04:32:52.309 --> 04:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
column to the um to the right
 
04:32:54.710 --> 04:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
so that's this is actually the column
 
04:32:58.309 --> 04:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
that the that the proposed formula would
 
04:33:00.530 --> 04:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
would calculate correct is that right
 
04:33:04.429 --> 04:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
and then how that might change over
 
04:33:06.709 --> 04:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
over time whether that's through CPI
 
04:33:11.150 --> 04:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:13.429 --> 04:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
because that will reflect
 
04:33:16.369 --> 04:33:16.379 align:start position:0%
that's the reflection of the formula
 
04:33:18.949 --> 04:33:18.959 align:start position:0%
correct so going back to kind of the
 
04:33:21.289 --> 04:33:21.299 align:start position:0%
what we've sort of seen historically
 
04:33:22.849 --> 04:33:22.859 align:start position:0%
um it's been a really hard time looking
 
04:33:25.970 --> 04:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
at data during covet covid really messed
 
04:33:27.769 --> 04:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
up a lot of data sets for us but
 
04:33:30.170 --> 04:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
generally the data has been pretty
 
04:33:32.570 --> 04:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
stable for schools and you kind of sort
 
04:33:35.570 --> 04:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
of saw it just sort of the the one
 
04:33:37.429 --> 04:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
percent enrollment Decline and then the
 
04:33:41.209 --> 04:33:41.219 align:start position:0%
two-year change in the CPI it's sort of
 
04:33:43.670 --> 04:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
just kind of just flat is that your
 
04:33:44.689 --> 04:33:44.699 align:start position:0%
experience when you look at the
 
04:33:46.369 --> 04:33:46.379 align:start position:0%
historical data yeah sort of just flat
 
04:33:48.109 --> 04:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit down
 
04:33:48.119 --> 04:33:48.709 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit down
um

04:33:48.709 --> 04:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:50.929 --> 04:33:50.939 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:33:50.939 --> 04:33:52.369 align:start position:0%
and so
um

04:33:52.369 --> 04:33:52.379 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:54.769 --> 04:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
I think if you assume a one percent
 
04:33:56.810 --> 04:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
if so if we've historically done a two
 
04:33:59.810 --> 04:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
percent CPI every two years and so if we
 
04:34:01.970 --> 04:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
assume if now for doing that every year
 
04:34:03.709 --> 04:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
and we assume a one percent enrollment
 
04:34:05.029 --> 04:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
decline it's not going to be flat it's
 
04:34:06.949 --> 04:34:06.959 align:start position:0%
going to increase
 
04:34:06.959 --> 04:34:08.570 align:start position:0%
going to increase
um

04:34:08.570 --> 04:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:10.310 --> 04:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
um so it's a good increase in the future
 
04:34:13.730 --> 04:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
the formula is now
 
04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
going to increase more in the future if
 
04:34:18.109 --> 04:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
we can keep on holding that two percent
 
04:34:19.551 --> 04:34:19.561 align:start position:0%
um over what it's done historically
 
04:34:22.189 --> 04:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
which is the CPI every two years
 
04:34:23.631 --> 04:34:23.641 align:start position:0%
so that's is that was that your question
 
04:34:25.250 --> 04:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's sort of it and I
 
04:34:27.349 --> 04:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
guess just from a from an observation
 
04:34:29.570 --> 04:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
standpoint with all that said so that
 
04:34:32.631 --> 04:34:32.641 align:start position:0%
that number would increase just ever so
 
04:34:32.641 --> 04:34:34.369 align:start position:0%
that number would increase just ever so
slightly

04:34:34.369 --> 04:34:34.379 align:start position:0%
slightly
 
04:34:36.890 --> 04:34:36.900 align:start position:0%
um every year but another way to look at
 
04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
this is that in the first If This Were
 
04:34:43.551 --> 04:34:43.561 align:start position:0%
to become law in the in the first um two
 
04:34:46.131 --> 04:34:46.141 align:start position:0%
first biennium you'd have the final the
 
04:34:47.990 --> 04:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
column on the right would be the Grant
 
04:34:50.570 --> 04:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
and then over a 10-year period it would
 
04:34:53.631 --> 04:34:53.641 align:start position:0%
move towards that column just to the
 
04:34:55.010 --> 04:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
left of that
 
04:34:56.990 --> 04:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
oh so you're talking about decreasing
 
04:34:58.490 --> 04:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
excess web
 
04:35:00.769 --> 04:35:00.779 align:start position:0%
no no no I'm talking about the
 
04:35:03.230 --> 04:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
decreasing the hold harmless that
 
04:35:06.830 --> 04:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:10.189 --> 04:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
um so Statewide on a Statewide basis
 
04:35:10.199 --> 04:35:11.510 align:start position:0%
um so Statewide on a Statewide basis
um

04:35:11.510 --> 04:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:13.670 --> 04:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
um and this is what this this table
 
04:35:16.310 --> 04:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:21.170 --> 04:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:23.269 --> 04:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
um so again holding a lot of assumptions
 
04:35:26.390 --> 04:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
into the future this table attempts this
 
04:35:28.929 --> 04:35:28.939 align:start position:0%
this page page five attempts to kind of
 
04:35:31.730 --> 04:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh think about 10 years into the future
 
04:35:34.070 --> 04:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
it makes assumptions assumptions like
 
04:35:36.349 --> 04:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct cert is enacted uh makes
 
04:35:38.869 --> 04:35:38.879 align:start position:0%
assumptions about enrollment decline
 
04:35:41.810 --> 04:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
um it triggers the 20 reduction and hold
 
04:35:44.631 --> 04:35:44.641 align:start position:0%
harmless it triggers the 50 increase in
 
04:35:46.551 --> 04:35:46.561 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs Grant and at a
 
04:35:48.830 --> 04:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
Statewide lab basis it's going to show
 
04:35:50.990 --> 04:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
increased Aid amount so it's going to
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
show it increasing over time
 
04:35:55.250 --> 04:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
but how it impacts each individual
 
04:35:59.631 --> 04:35:59.641 align:start position:0%
Community depends on multiple variables
 
04:36:02.209 --> 04:36:02.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:36:04.250 --> 04:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
um while you're on page five
 
04:36:06.109 --> 04:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
if you look at the numbers on the bottom
 
04:36:07.970 --> 04:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
what originally tripped me and the
 
04:36:09.410 --> 04:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
reason why I originally missed the drop
 
04:36:12.051 --> 04:36:12.061 align:start position:0%
in 2026 was I kind of read the bottom
 
04:36:14.029 --> 04:36:14.039 align:start position:0%
number and I assumed that was the total
 
04:36:16.429 --> 04:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
it's not it's three numbers that you've
 
04:36:18.890 --> 04:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
got to add up if you want to maybe edit
 
04:36:20.869 --> 04:36:20.879 align:start position:0%
that chart and throw a total at the
 
04:36:23.510 --> 04:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
bottom oh it would it would be much
 
04:36:25.551 --> 04:36:25.561 align:start position:0%
easier for a number driven person rather
 
04:36:27.949 --> 04:36:27.959 align:start position:0%
than a graphics driven person to notice
 
04:36:30.590 --> 04:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
the drop you know that's just me because
 
04:36:32.570 --> 04:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
I read numbers and the real question
 
04:36:35.029 --> 04:36:35.039 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to ask was obviously we
 
04:36:37.131 --> 04:36:37.141 align:start position:0%
have a bill coming up which has to do
 
04:36:39.709 --> 04:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
with direct enrollment in Medicaid
 
04:36:42.709 --> 04:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
um as far as the Educational Funding is
 
04:36:44.631 --> 04:36:44.641 align:start position:0%
concerned there have been concerns
 
04:36:46.910 --> 04:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier in our previous meet
 
04:36:49.070 --> 04:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
you know hearings and work sessions that
 
04:36:51.650 --> 04:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
because of the drop in the number of
 
04:36:53.689 --> 04:36:53.699 align:start position:0%
people filing the fnr paperwork because
 
04:36:55.010 --> 04:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
they don't have to because they get the
 
04:36:56.689 --> 04:36:56.699 align:start position:0%
meals for free because of the you know
 
04:36:59.990 --> 04:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
covid related measures it may be good
 
04:37:04.189 --> 04:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
policy to just stop using the fnr and
 
04:37:07.310 --> 04:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
shift towards using you know the number
 
04:37:09.470 --> 04:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid eligible kids whether they
 
04:37:11.869 --> 04:37:11.879 align:start position:0%
are enrolled or not could you comment a
 
04:37:13.970 --> 04:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
little bit in terms of what are those
 
04:37:15.709 --> 04:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
income guidelines and would those
 
04:37:18.470 --> 04:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
measures be equivalent would they be
 
04:37:20.449 --> 04:37:20.459 align:start position:0%
acceptable to substitute one for another
 
04:37:23.449 --> 04:37:23.459 align:start position:0%
or how would we handle the potential
 
04:37:25.910 --> 04:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
transition you know like that because we
 
04:37:27.769 --> 04:37:27.779 align:start position:0%
are all aware I think that right now the
 
04:37:30.650 --> 04:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
fnr part is Under reporting the students
 
04:37:32.570 --> 04:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
so we are not funding the districts
 
04:37:32.580 --> 04:37:34.310 align:start position:0%
so we are not funding the districts
accurately

04:37:34.310 --> 04:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
accurately
 
04:37:36.949 --> 04:37:36.959 align:start position:0%
and you know whether that legislation
 
04:37:39.410 --> 04:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
passes or not we may want to just adjust
 
04:37:41.390 --> 04:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
the formula nonetheless to get the more
 
04:37:44.209 --> 04:37:44.219 align:start position:0%
accurate representation of the you know
 
04:37:46.429 --> 04:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
percentage of kids in poverty if you
 
04:37:46.439 --> 04:37:48.410 align:start position:0%
percentage of kids in poverty if you
want

04:37:48.410 --> 04:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
want
 
04:37:50.449 --> 04:37:50.459 align:start position:0%
this discussion came out with house uh
 
04:37:53.750 --> 04:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
and how sad uh over house house bill 601
 
04:37:55.910 --> 04:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
there are some states that do not they
 
04:37:58.490 --> 04:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
say no applications they they drop the
 
04:38:01.369 --> 04:38:01.379 align:start position:0%
applications uh House Ed can speak about
 
04:38:04.910 --> 04:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
the house position but the house
 
04:38:08.390 --> 04:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
the house as they pass that bill and put
 
04:38:10.369 --> 04:38:10.379 align:start position:0%
into this committee they were aware that
 
04:38:12.109 --> 04:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
they could make it State policy that no
 
04:38:14.029 --> 04:38:14.039 align:start position:0%
more applications they did not put that
 
04:38:16.189 --> 04:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
into the law so the house position
 
04:38:18.470 --> 04:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
currently has a past the house floor is
 
04:38:20.689 --> 04:38:20.699 align:start position:0%
that you will have the option to direct
 
04:38:22.250 --> 04:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
certify you also have the option to
 
04:38:23.929 --> 04:38:23.939 align:start position:0%
complete the application but there are
 
04:38:25.189 --> 04:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
some communities that are just
 
04:38:27.349 --> 04:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I believe
 
04:38:28.551 --> 04:38:28.561 align:start position:0%
um it might just be the Boston School
 
04:38:29.449 --> 04:38:29.459 align:start position:0%
District it might be all of
 
04:38:31.250 --> 04:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but they don't I think
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
they've foregone even using fnr
 
04:38:36.529 --> 04:38:36.539 align:start position:0%
applications and just focus really on
 
04:38:37.910 --> 04:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
their direct cert numbers to get their
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
Federal money
 
04:38:39.359 --> 04:38:40.609 align:start position:0%
Federal money
um

04:38:40.609 --> 04:38:40.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:43.730 --> 04:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
yeah so some some states do it
 
04:38:45.949 --> 04:38:45.959 align:start position:0%
um the house education was discussing
 
04:38:49.131 --> 04:38:49.141 align:start position:0%
that that same exact policy question
 
04:38:51.769 --> 04:38:51.779 align:start position:0%
my question was a bit slightly different
 
04:38:53.869 --> 04:38:53.879 align:start position:0%
even though the measure positive house
 
04:38:56.390 --> 04:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know that is a long way until that
 
04:38:58.910 --> 04:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
measure may become law and I don't want
 
04:39:00.709 --> 04:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
to assume that it's going to become law
 
04:39:03.289 --> 04:39:03.299 align:start position:0%
and I want to make sure I understand how
 
04:39:04.490 --> 04:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
could we
 
04:39:06.949 --> 04:39:06.959 align:start position:0%
adjust our formulas to prepare for
 
04:39:09.289 --> 04:39:09.299 align:start position:0%
either a scenario whether this goes
 
04:39:11.449 --> 04:39:11.459 align:start position:0%
through all the way and gets a signature
 
04:39:13.910 --> 04:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
or it doesn't in terms of fixing that
 
04:39:17.631 --> 04:39:17.641 align:start position:0%
fnr formula issue
 
04:39:19.670 --> 04:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
04:39:21.230 --> 04:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
in in
 
04:39:23.209 --> 04:39:23.219 align:start position:0%
that you bring up a good question trying
 
04:39:25.551 --> 04:39:25.561 align:start position:0%
to there's a lot of uncertainty uh
 
04:39:27.410 --> 04:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
there's some uncertainty in the in the
 
04:39:29.631 --> 04:39:29.641 align:start position:0%
adequacy calculation we have for 24.25
 
04:39:31.490 --> 04:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
there's always uncertainty usually we're
 
04:39:33.650 --> 04:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
off by millions of dollars it's a
 
04:39:36.170 --> 04:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
billion dollar calculation so my oh I
 
04:39:37.550 --> 04:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
always recommend you do not spend every
 
04:39:39.590 --> 04:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
last dollar the education trust fund
 
04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
um Because unless you really really are
 
04:39:43.730 --> 04:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
confident in those adequacy estimates
 
04:39:45.230 --> 04:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
um leave a little bit money in there
 
04:39:47.930 --> 04:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
because we will likely have a uh like
 
04:39:49.850 --> 04:39:49.860 align:start position:0%
this past year uh Mickey and I worked on
 
04:39:51.050 --> 04:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
the numbers Mickey relies on the
 
04:39:52.610 --> 04:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
Department's Department to provide him
 
04:39:55.130 --> 04:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
data and we work with the LBA to do a
 
04:39:56.990 --> 04:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
budget estimate we
 
04:39:59.208 --> 04:39:59.218 align:start position:0%
under budgeted by three million dollars
 
04:40:03.530 --> 04:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
for 22 we essentially over budgeted by
 
04:40:05.390 --> 04:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
nine million dollars so you can it's
 
04:40:07.490 --> 04:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
very easy to make a single million
 
04:40:08.990 --> 04:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
dollar digit swing
 
04:40:11.150 --> 04:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
um in an adequacy estimate so so that's
 
04:40:12.948 --> 04:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
usually the margin of error that three
 
04:40:15.350 --> 04:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars uh three to ten million
 
04:40:16.970 --> 04:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
dollars can can be kind of the margin of
 
04:40:18.350 --> 04:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
error with adequacy it's very easy to
 
04:40:19.730 --> 04:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
have those swings
 
04:40:21.470 --> 04:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
um so the only recommendation is I keep
 
04:40:22.490 --> 04:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
us keep some money in the education
 
04:40:24.170 --> 04:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
trust fund to deal with that or keep or
 
04:40:25.430 --> 04:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
in the general fund however you want to
 
04:40:26.570 --> 04:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
deal with it
 
04:40:29.448 --> 04:40:29.458 align:start position:0%
um but then also yeah uh Medicaid
 
04:40:31.368 --> 04:40:31.378 align:start position:0%
director would not impact the adequacy
 
04:40:35.930 --> 04:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
formula in 26 so it's not really a 24 25
 
04:40:38.390 --> 04:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
budgeting concern it is a structural
 
04:40:40.570 --> 04:40:40.580 align:start position:0%
concern in a sense that it will create
 
04:40:42.830 --> 04:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
future legislatures we'll have to deal
 
04:40:45.288 --> 04:40:45.298 align:start position:0%
with it from a budgeting perspective so
 
04:40:47.448 --> 04:40:47.458 align:start position:0%
however you want to manage that
 
04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
potential liability in the future is is
 
04:40:50.810 --> 04:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
definitely something strategically you
 
04:40:52.550 --> 04:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
can think about
 
04:40:55.190 --> 04:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
um but Medicaid director has a yeah a a
 
04:40:58.490 --> 04:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
26 26 and Beyond impact if that were to
 
04:41:00.830 --> 04:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
enacted and if we were to enter the
 
04:41:03.770 --> 04:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
pilot program and the USDA would approve
 
04:41:06.110 --> 04:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
us all those all those factors would be
 
04:41:07.910 --> 04:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
contingent upon all those factors
 
04:41:10.730 --> 04:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it and one last follow-up
 
04:41:14.270 --> 04:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
I obviously agree with what you said but
 
04:41:16.610 --> 04:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
we have a structural issue right now
 
04:41:19.910 --> 04:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
right with the fnr being unreported by a
 
04:41:21.708 --> 04:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
lot of districts which you know I don't
 
04:41:24.708 --> 04:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
know how much we want to wait or not and
 
04:41:28.490 --> 04:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering if we have data on
 
04:41:31.788 --> 04:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
what would uh you know happen if we uh
 
04:41:34.970 --> 04:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
tweaked the formula right now to rely on
 
04:41:38.270 --> 04:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
you know Medicaid daily eligibility
 
04:41:40.730 --> 04:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
numbers not necessarily on enrollments
 
04:41:43.368 --> 04:41:43.378 align:start position:0%
to substitute for the fnr and that would
 
04:41:45.350 --> 04:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
obviously require changes to the formula
 
04:41:49.550 --> 04:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:51.590 --> 04:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
um so there's two ways to do it to do it
 
04:41:55.490 --> 04:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
the way uh and this came up in in
 
04:41:57.830 --> 04:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
previous legislature uh previous work
 
04:41:59.570 --> 04:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
sessions with house ad and and house
 
04:42:01.190 --> 04:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
findings have dealt with this particular
 
04:42:04.788 --> 04:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
issue the challenge with using we can't
 
04:42:06.470 --> 04:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education can't touch
 
04:42:08.628 --> 04:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
Medicaid data right now because we need
 
04:42:10.070 --> 04:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
authorization from the center of
 
04:42:12.170 --> 04:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services and we don't get that
 
04:42:13.550 --> 04:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
authorization from the center of
 
04:42:15.708 --> 04:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services until we enter that
 
04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
pilot so our the Department of Education
 
04:42:19.850 --> 04:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
is completely blind to which students
 
04:42:21.410 --> 04:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
are on Medicaid because we don't have
 
04:42:23.030 --> 04:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
access to that data because it's it's
 
04:42:25.070 --> 04:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
highly private and regulated we need
 
04:42:26.090 --> 04:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
authorization from the federal
 
04:42:28.910 --> 04:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
government to access that um DHS will
 
04:42:30.708 --> 04:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
not uh let us access that data so we
 
04:42:32.150 --> 04:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
can't match it to the student to help
 
04:42:35.390 --> 04:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
inflate the F uh not inflate but throw
 
04:42:40.490 --> 04:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
the fnr numbers or um until that happens
 
04:42:43.850 --> 04:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
um the alternative option which um would
 
04:42:46.010 --> 04:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
be to just take the Medicaid number and
 
04:42:48.288 --> 04:42:48.298 align:start position:0%
use it and build a design a new formula
 
04:42:50.090 --> 04:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
via the grant take the Medicaid numbers
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
and just build say the Medicaid numbers
 
04:42:53.750 --> 04:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
exist we have the data let's build a new
 
04:42:55.368 --> 04:42:55.378 align:start position:0%
Grant it's not going to link to a
 
04:42:57.470 --> 04:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
particular student but that that would
 
04:43:00.110 --> 04:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
be the only way we could do a now
 
04:43:00.120 --> 04:43:01.430 align:start position:0%
be the only way we could do a now
um

04:43:01.430 --> 04:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:03.770 --> 04:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
um not using Medicare director thank you
 
04:43:05.030 --> 04:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
because all you're really doing is
 
04:43:07.788 --> 04:43:07.798 align:start position:0%
looking to put a number in that box how
 
04:43:09.890 --> 04:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
you get the number is the question
 
04:43:12.590 --> 04:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
correct it would just be a new if if you
 
04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
went that route it would just be a new
 
04:43:15.708 --> 04:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
part of the formula and it would be a
 
04:43:16.970 --> 04:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
new data set
 
04:43:18.830 --> 04:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
um a new data set that represents
 
04:43:20.330 --> 04:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
poverty different than the data set
 
04:43:23.050 --> 04:43:23.060 align:start position:0%
we're currently using which is fnr
 
04:43:26.270 --> 04:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
right uh thank you Mr chairman
 
04:43:26.280 --> 04:43:27.350 align:start position:0%
right uh thank you Mr chairman
um

04:43:27.350 --> 04:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
being reduced have you seen any uh you
 
04:43:33.410 --> 04:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
mentioned Boston as a the way they well
 
04:43:35.150 --> 04:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
they don't collect the data anymore how
 
04:43:37.670 --> 04:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
much does it cost to collect this data
 
04:43:40.250 --> 04:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
because I know in my district it's like
 
04:43:42.590 --> 04:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
a hot potato you know you take it no you
 
04:43:44.810 --> 04:43:44.820 align:start position:0%
take it and it you know and it does cost
 
04:43:47.448 --> 04:43:47.458 align:start position:0%
I mean somebody's this to spends you
 
04:43:49.070 --> 04:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
probably don't realize how much time it
 
04:43:50.810 --> 04:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
takes to you know collect all this data
 
04:43:51.948 --> 04:43:51.958 align:start position:0%
because you got to send the forms out
 
04:43:53.810 --> 04:43:53.820 align:start position:0%
you're hoping get them back you keep
 
04:43:56.448 --> 04:43:56.458 align:start position:0%
pinging on you know the you know the
 
04:43:59.448 --> 04:43:59.458 align:start position:0%
parents to to bring them in which on my
 
04:44:01.190 --> 04:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
district is I mean it's terrible it's
 
04:44:05.810 --> 04:44:05.820 align:start position:0%
144 less uh you know students on free
 
04:44:08.448 --> 04:44:08.458 align:start position:0%
and reducing there was last last uh last
 
04:44:11.208 --> 04:44:11.218 align:start position:0%
time we checked I mean that's that
 
04:44:13.310 --> 04:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
that's something to think about we don't
 
04:44:16.010 --> 04:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
have any any data to report on the like
 
04:44:17.628 --> 04:44:17.638 align:start position:0%
numerical data report on the
 
04:44:20.030 --> 04:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
administrative costs but we see we
 
04:44:21.350 --> 04:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
always talk to the seus we tell them
 
04:44:22.490 --> 04:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's important to get that F in our
 
04:44:23.990 --> 04:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
application they say we're trying our
 
04:44:26.090 --> 04:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
best it's really challenging and it's an
 
04:44:27.410 --> 04:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
ongoing conversation we have with them
 
04:44:29.208 --> 04:44:29.218 align:start position:0%
we're like we you know we know it's hard
 
04:44:31.610 --> 04:44:31.620 align:start position:0%
you have to keep trying and uh but yeah
 
04:44:33.590 --> 04:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of it's a challenge right and a
 
04:44:36.050 --> 04:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that to the Medicaid
 
04:44:38.868 --> 04:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
you you have access to the numbers right
 
04:44:42.770 --> 04:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
per Town per Town yeah so so I mean that
 
04:44:44.510 --> 04:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
would that would fit in the formula to
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
fit that could be fit it is it is the
 
04:44:48.890 --> 04:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
data is granular enough that it is
 
04:44:50.510 --> 04:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
captured at the municipal level that it
 
04:44:52.670 --> 04:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
could be rolled into adequacy
 
04:44:54.350 --> 04:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
um but it could not be rolled into the
 
04:44:56.330 --> 04:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
student level data
 
04:44:58.430 --> 04:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
um it just the sum totals we do have
 
04:45:01.128 --> 04:45:01.138 align:start position:0%
that data probably level of that town
 
04:45:02.990 --> 04:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
the only thing we don't have is when
 
04:45:05.390 --> 04:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
DHHS gave us the data they don't have
 
04:45:07.490 --> 04:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
DHHS doesn't collect data on Pinnacle
 
04:45:09.530 --> 04:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
but Penacook is a municipal so there
 
04:45:10.610 --> 04:45:10.620 align:start position:0%
would be some adjustments and tweaks
 
04:45:11.990 --> 04:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
with some of the communities
 
04:45:13.430 --> 04:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
um just mainly just kind of cook I think
 
04:45:17.150 --> 04:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
but we have assuming the DHT data DHS
 
04:45:19.190 --> 04:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
gave us is good we have that data thank
 
04:45:19.200 --> 04:45:21.110 align:start position:0%
gave us is good we have that data thank
you

04:45:21.110 --> 04:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:45:24.470 --> 04:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:24.480 --> 04:45:26.448 align:start position:0%
 
nope

04:45:26.448 --> 04:45:26.458 align:start position:0%
nope
 
04:45:28.788 --> 04:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
this data doesn't seem to reflect 100
 
04:45:32.990 --> 04:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
million we took out of swept but 2023.
 
04:45:35.750 --> 04:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
ah yeah that was just fiscal year 23
 
04:45:38.990 --> 04:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
one-time swept reduction
 
04:45:41.208 --> 04:45:41.218 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply in this does not apply in
 
04:45:43.490 --> 04:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24.
 
04:45:47.330 --> 04:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
we showed 2023 in here
 
04:45:50.810 --> 04:45:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:54.350 --> 04:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
oh that's 2024. did I say 2023
 
04:45:57.530 --> 04:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
oh school year 2023. so it's the adm's
 
04:45:59.628 --> 04:45:59.638 align:start position:0%
adequacy the student data is one year
 
04:46:01.310 --> 04:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
behind so we're going to use the school
 
04:46:04.430 --> 04:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
year data from 2223 those student counts
 
04:46:06.890 --> 04:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
are going to fund fiscal year 24. so
 
04:46:08.690 --> 04:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
it's the fiscal year 24 formula which is
 
04:46:10.010 --> 04:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
based on student data from the year
 
04:46:10.020 --> 04:46:10.910 align:start position:0%
based on student data from the year
behind

04:46:10.910 --> 04:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
behind
 
04:46:13.610 --> 04:46:13.620 align:start position:0%
and I I don't think any of us have yet
 
04:46:15.948 --> 04:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
seen the reduction
 
04:46:19.730 --> 04:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
in that 100 million so uh tax bills tax
 
04:46:22.788 --> 04:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
rates were set this past fall
 
04:46:25.910 --> 04:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
and it should have included
 
04:46:27.890 --> 04:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
the sweat reduction
 
04:46:30.230 --> 04:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
about 50 cents on attack but 50 cents
 
04:46:32.448 --> 04:46:32.458 align:start position:0%
didn't reduce didn't seem to reduce the
 
04:46:34.430 --> 04:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
taxes so yeah there's the it's it
 
04:46:37.368 --> 04:46:37.378 align:start position:0%
there's the uh there's four taxes as you
 
04:46:39.230 --> 04:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
know four taxes you pay uh typical
 
04:46:42.350 --> 04:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayer residential uh sorry um typical
 
04:46:43.930 --> 04:46:43.940 align:start position:0%
residential commercial taxpayer pays
 
04:46:48.288 --> 04:46:48.298 align:start position:0%
Muni uh County local school state Ed and
 
04:46:49.850 --> 04:46:49.860 align:start position:0%
so the total racks tax rate might be
 
04:46:51.350 --> 04:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
going up in your community but the sweat
 
04:46:53.570 --> 04:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
might have decreased a little bit uh but
 
04:46:55.010 --> 04:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
you guys bring that up to your school
 
04:46:57.110 --> 04:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
board municipal government and your
 
04:46:58.970 --> 04:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
County uh to find out what happened
 
04:47:02.990 --> 04:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:04.970 --> 04:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
that was set right at the uh when they
 
04:47:07.310 --> 04:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
set the tax rate because that didn't get
 
04:47:09.170 --> 04:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
to the school district
 
04:47:11.990 --> 04:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
per se I mean you know the overall rate
 
04:47:13.788 --> 04:47:13.798 align:start position:0%
is you know they in other words it
 
04:47:16.128 --> 04:47:16.138 align:start position:0%
didn't go to the schools it went to the
 
04:47:17.930 --> 04:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
tax rate
 
04:47:20.330 --> 04:47:20.340 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I reduced the tax rate which
 
04:47:21.948 --> 04:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
will decrease the swept funding the
 
04:47:23.990 --> 04:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
school receive but it's happening yeah
 
04:47:27.350 --> 04:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a tax year and a
 
04:47:28.970 --> 04:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
school year and a fiscal year and they
 
04:47:30.890 --> 04:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
all kind of it all gets worked out by
 
04:47:32.628 --> 04:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
dra I can't really speak to all the
 
04:47:33.650 --> 04:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
different scheduling that happens there
 
04:47:36.830 --> 04:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:42.718 --> 04:47:45.830 align:start position:0%
 
situation

04:47:45.830 --> 04:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:48.530 --> 04:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
another thing that Mickey and I have
 
04:47:49.910 --> 04:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
been talking a little bit about this and
 
04:47:53.330 --> 04:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
uh uh chairwoman uh representative
 
04:47:56.510 --> 04:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
umberger also uh discussed it as well
 
04:47:58.550 --> 04:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
um the other day
 
04:48:00.890 --> 04:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee back in I think
 
04:48:00.900 --> 04:48:02.270 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee back in I think
December

04:48:02.270 --> 04:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
December
 
04:48:05.690 --> 04:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
changed the snap eligibility from 185 to
 
04:48:05.700 --> 04:48:07.010 align:start position:0%
changed the snap eligibility from 185 to
200.

04:48:07.010 --> 04:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
200.
 
04:48:09.650 --> 04:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
they did that I think in December and so
 
04:48:11.530 --> 04:48:11.540 align:start position:0%
if you increase the snap eligibility
 
04:48:13.610 --> 04:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
more students are going to be now
 
04:48:16.368 --> 04:48:16.378 align:start position:0%
eligible for fnr the numbers I have
 
04:48:16.378 --> 04:48:17.868 align:start position:0%
eligible for fnr the numbers I have
produced

04:48:17.868 --> 04:48:17.878 align:start position:0%
produced
 
04:48:20.570 --> 04:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
the number of frr students I'm carrying
 
04:48:23.090 --> 04:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 24 25 on these
 
04:48:24.470 --> 04:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets in the governor's budget
 
04:48:28.250 --> 04:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
does not in does not include any
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
increase for how many students might be
 
04:48:33.708 --> 04:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
added to uh
 
04:48:33.718 --> 04:48:34.430 align:start position:0%
added to uh
um

04:48:34.430 --> 04:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:36.050 --> 04:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
might be added to the fnr numbers
 
04:48:39.050 --> 04:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
because they're 185 percent to 200
 
04:48:40.970 --> 04:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
percent that program has been in
 
04:48:43.670 --> 04:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
operation since January so I I just
 
04:48:43.680 --> 04:48:44.510 align:start position:0%
operation since January so I I just
actually

04:48:44.510 --> 04:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:48:46.070 --> 04:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
um just emailed director Herbert to say
 
04:48:47.690 --> 04:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
hey do you have any data on how many
 
04:48:48.770 --> 04:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
kids are how many kids are showing up
 
04:48:51.110 --> 04:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
for the 185 200 range
 
04:48:53.330 --> 04:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
um DHHS made an original estimate they
 
04:48:55.010 --> 04:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
think there's six thousand around six
 
04:48:56.448 --> 04:48:56.458 align:start position:0%
thousand six to sixty five hundred
 
04:48:58.670 --> 04:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
students potentially out there
 
04:49:01.190 --> 04:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
um if you take 6 500 we don't know where
 
04:49:02.868 --> 04:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
those students live but they estimate
 
04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
that there potentially could be 6 500
 
04:49:06.110 --> 04:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
students out there
 
04:49:08.390 --> 04:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
if you take 6 500 students and just
 
04:49:10.850 --> 04:49:10.860 align:start position:0%
assume they live exactly where all the f
 
04:49:12.770 --> 04:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
r students live and run it through the
 
04:49:16.730 --> 04:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
formula it has an annualized cost of 20
 
04:49:20.390 --> 04:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:23.030 --> 04:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not carrying it on here it's not
 
04:49:24.110 --> 04:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
carried on here because I don't have
 
04:49:26.390 --> 04:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
that data and I don't know if DHS has
 
04:49:29.750 --> 04:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
data DHS did an estimate so I'm gonna
 
04:49:31.910 --> 04:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully get information from DHHS
 
04:49:34.368 --> 04:49:34.378 align:start position:0%
about how successful that program is it
 
04:49:35.750 --> 04:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
may be successful it may not be
 
04:49:38.090 --> 04:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
successful I don't know it may be six
 
04:49:40.368 --> 04:49:40.378 align:start position:0%
thousand kids it may be less
 
04:49:43.730 --> 04:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
um so it's another uncertainty in your
 
04:49:46.250 --> 04:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
budget and so
 
04:49:48.410 --> 04:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
um what what Mickey thought about and I
 
04:49:50.090 --> 04:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
thought maybe when Mickey said that
 
04:49:51.410 --> 04:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
might be an option that you might have
 
04:49:53.208 --> 04:49:53.218 align:start position:0%
to deal with this from a budgeting
 
04:49:55.490 --> 04:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
perspective is there's uncertainty there
 
04:49:58.310 --> 04:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
it could be a 20 million dollar cost
 
04:49:59.750 --> 04:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
it just might be something you want to
 
04:50:01.550 --> 04:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
carry on your Surplus statement
 
04:50:02.690 --> 04:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
um so I'm sorry to make the bad news
 
04:50:04.010 --> 04:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
that you have 20 million dollars in cost
 
04:50:05.448 --> 04:50:05.458 align:start position:0%
what's actually really unknown we don't
 
04:50:07.010 --> 04:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
know we we think it will cost 20 million
 
04:50:09.530 --> 04:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
dollars but another another potential
 
04:50:11.750 --> 04:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh Financial liability that might be out
 
04:50:13.490 --> 04:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
there that was fiscal committee made
 
04:50:15.230 --> 04:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
that decision that program started
 
04:50:17.448 --> 04:50:17.458 align:start position:0%
getting enacted in January so we're
 
04:50:18.770 --> 04:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
gonna have a half year of that program
 
04:50:20.750 --> 04:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
running for this fiscal year which will
 
04:50:23.570 --> 04:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
impact 24. so if we say a half year of
 
04:50:25.850 --> 04:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
20 million dollars let's say 10 million
 
04:50:27.050 --> 04:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
dollars in
 
04:50:27.060 --> 04:50:27.650 align:start position:0%
dollars in
um

04:50:27.650 --> 04:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:31.190 --> 04:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh 10 million dollars and 24 maybe 25
 
04:50:33.830 --> 04:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
20 million dollars in in 25
 
04:50:35.750 --> 04:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
I really don't know
 
04:50:37.670 --> 04:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
um just based on DHS data that's the
 
04:50:41.510 --> 04:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:54.610 --> 04:50:54.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:02.030 --> 04:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:03.650 --> 04:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
I think it's providing more benefits
 
04:51:04.970 --> 04:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
because it's expanding the eligibility
 
04:51:04.980 --> 04:51:06.350 align:start position:0%
because it's expanding the eligibility
cool

04:51:06.350 --> 04:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
cool
 
04:51:09.830 --> 04:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
um and it's Federal money from a dhhss
 
04:51:12.050 --> 04:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
perspective where the state's cost is
 
04:51:18.410 --> 04:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:22.868 --> 04:51:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:26.690 --> 04:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
we'll see it in our eoi we'll see it in
 
04:51:28.368 --> 04:51:28.378 align:start position:0%
our eoi when we finish the school year
 
04:51:30.170 --> 04:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
and try to tally up all the students
 
04:51:33.590 --> 04:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
that were educated in 2223 we'll also
 
04:51:35.990 --> 04:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
get the latest direct search data and so
 
04:51:38.510 --> 04:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
we'll see it this summer we'll know well
 
04:51:40.250 --> 04:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
it's a summer we'll know what what does
 
04:51:41.810 --> 04:51:41.820 align:start position:0%
that program look like in half a year of
 
04:51:41.820 --> 04:51:43.250 align:start position:0%
that program look like in half a year of
operation

04:51:43.250 --> 04:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
operation
 
04:51:45.350 --> 04:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
um we'll have well a final number for
 
04:51:47.330 --> 04:51:47.340 align:start position:0%
24. so we might see a 10 million dollar
 
04:51:47.340 --> 04:51:48.310 align:start position:0%
24. so we might see a 10 million dollar
boost

04:51:48.310 --> 04:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
boost
 
04:51:53.330 --> 04:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
so yeah so so is that snap TANF is that
 
04:51:54.830 --> 04:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
direct cert now
 
04:51:58.368 --> 04:51:58.378 align:start position:0%
correct okay so and that's been in in
 
04:52:01.070 --> 04:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
enforced for a long time snap TANF has
 
04:52:02.690 --> 04:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
been operating for
 
04:52:05.030 --> 04:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
um a long time I don't know how long
 
04:52:06.650 --> 04:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
right right because I I've seen it
 
04:52:08.230 --> 04:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
before 2000 and
 
04:52:11.628 --> 04:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
2006. okay the change to 185 to 200
 
04:52:14.330 --> 04:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
eligibility is effective January one
 
04:52:16.610 --> 04:52:16.620 align:start position:0%
very good thank you I just wanted to
 
04:52:18.530 --> 04:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
take a moment to thank you for bringing
 
04:52:21.050 --> 04:52:21.060 align:start position:0%
that potential feature uh issue up
 
04:52:23.810 --> 04:52:23.820 align:start position:0%
because 20 million or 30 million is not
 
04:52:26.030 --> 04:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
exactly a rounding error or any budget
 
04:52:30.590 --> 04:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
and I think it behooves us to budget for
 
04:52:32.448 --> 04:52:32.458 align:start position:0%
the worst case scenario here because the
 
04:52:34.368 --> 04:52:34.378 align:start position:0%
one thing we cannot afford to do is run
 
04:52:38.628 --> 04:52:38.638 align:start position:0%
out of uh you know funds so while it is
 
04:52:40.910 --> 04:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
possible that some of those people are
 
04:52:42.708 --> 04:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
in districts where they would fall under
 
04:52:45.110 --> 04:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
the 12 percent and maybe they will not
 
04:52:47.930 --> 04:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
affect the final formula it would be
 
04:52:50.990 --> 04:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
imprudent of us to be optimistic about
 
04:52:53.090 --> 04:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
it and I would rather have
 
04:52:55.250 --> 04:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
you know a bit too much money left in
 
04:52:56.930 --> 04:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
the fund at the end but be sure that we
 
04:52:59.150 --> 04:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
can pay our obligations than the other
 
04:53:01.910 --> 04:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
way around so seriously that's honestly
 
04:53:03.948 --> 04:53:03.958 align:start position:0%
the kind of information that I would
 
04:53:06.050 --> 04:53:06.060 align:start position:0%
have never you know gotten if I just
 
04:53:07.670 --> 04:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
read about it so I really appreciate the
 
04:53:09.890 --> 04:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
Insight thank you after I have to say it
 
04:53:11.510 --> 04:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
was Mickey who said Mark we got it we
 
04:53:13.550 --> 04:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
gotta talk about this and Mickey's gonna
 
04:53:14.930 --> 04:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
Mickey's gonna hold he's gonna build
 
04:53:16.190 --> 04:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
your Surplus statement with you and he's
 
04:53:17.930 --> 04:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
gonna make sure you you balance thing
 
04:53:19.910 --> 04:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
out and you have all the all as the
 
04:53:20.990 --> 04:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner said all the debits and
 
04:53:22.730 --> 04:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
credits in front of you so
 
04:53:24.530 --> 04:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
um you're in good hands
 
04:53:26.510 --> 04:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
I I will give credit to the former chair
 
04:53:29.050 --> 04:53:29.060 align:start position:0%
who reminded me to remind you today so
 
04:53:32.030 --> 04:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh so yes to clarify what Mark's
 
04:53:34.750 --> 04:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
referring to with the Surplus statement
 
04:53:36.890 --> 04:53:36.900 align:start position:0%
whatever you decide to do this
 
04:53:38.270 --> 04:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
committee's recommendation for Education
 
04:53:40.070 --> 04:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
funding will will calculate it to the
 
04:53:41.990 --> 04:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
best that we can based on the data that
 
04:53:44.330 --> 04:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
we have that data we just don't have on
 
04:53:47.030 --> 04:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
a Town by Town basis so depending on the
 
04:53:49.788 --> 04:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
policy that you approve we can come up
 
04:53:51.350 --> 04:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
with an estimate that you could have on
 
04:53:52.970 --> 04:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
the Surplus statement to reflect this
 
04:53:54.410 --> 04:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
additional cost that will be in the end
 
04:53:55.850 --> 04:53:55.860 align:start position:0%
of year counts that we just don't know
 
04:53:57.470 --> 04:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
we won't know for your timeline to do a
 
04:53:59.510 --> 04:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
house budget so if I read this properly
 
04:54:02.288 --> 04:54:02.298 align:start position:0%
then and using the governor's numbers
 
04:54:05.868 --> 04:54:05.878 align:start position:0%
148 million dollars so yes looking at
 
04:54:07.970 --> 04:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
this uh snapshot this education trust
 
04:54:09.650 --> 04:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
fund snapshot So based on the governor's
 
04:54:11.330 --> 04:54:11.340 align:start position:0%
recommended budget with the governor's
 
04:54:13.910 --> 04:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates in there for now your
 
04:54:15.948 --> 04:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
starting point before Ways and Means
 
04:54:17.390 --> 04:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
does the revenue adjustments and before
 
04:54:19.368 --> 04:54:19.378 align:start position:0%
you touch House Bill wanted the house
 
04:54:22.310 --> 04:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
bill 2 the education trust fund has 148
 
04:54:23.990 --> 04:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
million dollar Surplus even after all
 
04:54:26.448 --> 04:54:26.458 align:start position:0%
the uh proposals and everything you've
 
04:54:30.890 --> 04:54:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:34.490 --> 04:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:36.590 --> 04:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
I think we've gone through quite a bit
 
04:54:38.628 --> 04:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
of information today oh
 
04:54:38.638 --> 04:54:40.128 align:start position:0%
