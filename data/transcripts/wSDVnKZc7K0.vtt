resigning from the New Hampshire house

effective immediately it has been an
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
honor and privilege to represent the
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
citizens of Hudson and Pelham these past
 
00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:45.299 align:start position:0%
four years running and serving as a
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
State Rep is one of the best decisions
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
I've ever made I'll treasure the
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to serve and the many dear
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
friendships with legislators staff and
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
lobbyists I've gained along the way
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
my wife Kathy and I decided about 15
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
years ago to someday retire in Florida
 
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
full-time we are relocating to the
 
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
villages to our home we recently
 
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
purchased and will no longer be residing
 
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire Kathy has waited
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
patiently these past two years to allow
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
me to serve a second term I hope to
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
remain politically active in Florida via
 
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
various organizations assisting with
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
campaigns or perhaps running for office
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
once again locally the decision to
 
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
resign and move out of state is surely
 
00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:21.419 align:start position:0%
Bittersweet for as much as I look
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
forward to the next chapter in my life
 
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:24.900 align:start position:0%

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
tremendous honor and privilege and
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
humbling experience to serve nearly six
 
00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
years in this historic and venerable
 
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
body representing Nashua and the granite
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
state as a whole I've met and worked
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
with so many wonderful people true
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
public servants working in Concord

surrounded by history and tradition has
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
been an experience I will never forget
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
as you are aware I've had serious health
 
00:21:06.049 --> 00:21:06.059 align:start position:0%
issues and now find that the disease is
 
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
progressing much faster than expected
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
making it nearly impossible for me to
 
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
participate in any meaningful way in the
 
00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
house activities
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.100 align:start position:0%

via letter to the speaker August 30th
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
2022. Mr Speaker in the recent past we
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
had a conversation about life changes
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
and decisions in my household as my
 
00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
partner continues through the process of
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
selling his business here we've
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
purchased a home and we'll be relocating
 
00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:03.539 align:start position:0%
to Tennessee while a decision was
 
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
difficult we feel it is best for us at
 
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
this time over the next several weeks I
 
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
will be away handling the move and
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
working on that property to secure our
 
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
full arrival for this reason I think it
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
only fair that because I cannot be
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
present to perform my duties it would be
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
proper for me to turn in my resignation
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
my time in the legislature in our
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
Republican caucus with our very talented
 
00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
leaders has been one of the most
 
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
rewarding times of my life I've had the
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to serve with and learn from
 
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
the best and hopefully my contributions
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
were thought of as positive for our
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
great state I thank you for your trust
 
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
in the rest of leadership in particular
 
00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:36.900 align:start position:0%
our Majority Leader Jason Osborne I
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank it for his wisdom and guidance and
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
to my fellow legislators I appreciated
 
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
learning from each and every one of you
 
00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
keep up the good work I wish the best
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
for all of you and continue to hope for
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
the continuance of legislating from the
 
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:49.860 align:start position:0%
liberty and freedom perspective because
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
in this where each individual citizen
 
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
will gain the most we are here to work
 
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
for the people and should always think
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
of how each piece of legislation that is
 
00:23:59.690 --> 00:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
presented for debate and discussion will
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
affect them in Liberty Herschel Nunes
 
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
via email September 1st 2022 Dear Mr
 
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
Speaker and esteemed colleagues I hereby
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
resign from the house effective
 
00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:12.419 align:start position:0%
September 11 2012 due to the fact that I
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
am moving out of state it has been a
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
pleasure and an honor to serve the town
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
of Exeter in the New Hampshire house my
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
parting wish for the chamber is that
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
those who labor within its May and
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
future find new ways to remember what we
 
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
all have in common and special spend
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
less time concentrating on what divides
 
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
house will attend to a motion to suspend
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:43.980 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker representative Osborne and
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
walner move that all necessary house
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
rules be so far suspended as to allow
 
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
introduction and consideration at the
 
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
present time of House Bill 2023 FNA
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%

00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:25.149 align:start position:0%
reading a copy of which is in your seat
pockets

00:25:25.149 --> 00:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Prout
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.049 --> 00:25:36.059 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I oppose the motion to
 
00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:42.539 align:start position:0%
suspend the rules
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
the process of having hearings on bills
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
is important listening to public
 
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
feedback on proposed language allowing
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
time for many eyes to read bills and
 
00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
point out flaws in the language is
 
00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.710 align:start position:0%
point out flaws in the language is
important

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
one such flaw that is obvious in this
 
00:25:59.690 --> 00:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
bill is that it has no phasing out
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
provision if a household makes one
 
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
dollar too much you get nothing
 
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
this perverse incentive for some to make
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
a little less money turn down those
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
extra hours to stay under the limit is
 
00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:15.299 align:start position:0%
enough to make me vote against this bill
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
but also by bringing this bill to us via
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
suspension of the rules we have no
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to draft floor amendments
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
they would have had to have been turned
 
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
into the clerk by 4 pm yesterday on a
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
bill that isn't formally introduced
 
00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:30.299 align:start position:0%
unless we pass the motion before us
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
even if I wanted to propose a compromise
 
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
to make this terrible wealth
 
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
redistribution program that will take
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
funds that came from all the taxpayers
 
00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and give it to
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
approximately three percent of
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
households slightly less abhorrent
 
00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
There's no practical way for me to do so
 
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
this is a bad way of doing business
 
00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
this is why our rules normally do not
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
allow for us to do this
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
and why we should all vote against
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
suspending them today
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
I ask you to press the red button and
 
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
join me in saying no to this motion to
 
00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
suspend the rules
 
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
I recognize representative Abramson
 
00:27:12.169 --> 00:27:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I rise in opposition to the
 
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
motion to suspend the rules on this
 
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.090 align:start position:0%
motion to suspend the rules on this
measure

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
measure
 
00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
for the simple reason that I contacted
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
my constituents in Seabrook and Hampton
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
and Hampton Falls and asked their
 
00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:27.179 align:start position:0%
opinion on this and they thought that
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
this was a terrible idea that it was
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
described as a drop in the bucket or
 
00:27:33.649 --> 00:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
would have no impact whatsoever but I
 
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
think that it would have a small impact
 
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
the perhaps five or six percent of of
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
people in the state who would actually
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
qualify and actually receive some
 
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
benefit from the money there's no
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
question that they would receive a small
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
amount of savings but the other 94 95
 
00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
percent of people hate it when they see
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
their tax money taken from them and
 
00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
given to benefit someone else and that's
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
always been the case and no one could
 
00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
possibly serve in this house and not
 
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
know about the the the issue that
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers hate paying more in taxes and
 
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
then seeing someone else get the money
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
and then being disqualified from getting
 
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
the benefit on themselves but there's a
 
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
bigger economic issue I have a
 
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
background in economics and one of the
 
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
first things I learned in my high school
 
00:28:18.289 --> 00:28:18.299 align:start position:0%
economics class was that any time you
 
00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:20.039 align:start position:0%
subsidize something any taxpayers
 
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
subsidies merely drive up the cost this
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
will not increase the amount of energy
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
or the amount of goods and services that
 
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
we're able to consume it will only
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
increase the subsidies to the energy
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
sector this has been viewed by some and
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
described by some in our state as
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
corporate welfare although it's in an
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
indirect form the ultimate benefit I
 
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
think will not go to the general public
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
that the general public will see the
 
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
loss in an opportunity this that
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
representative this is about the
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
suspension of the rules not the bill
 
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.190 align:start position:0%
suspension of the rules not the bill
itself

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:28:54.049 --> 00:28:54.059 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
um I apologize for that
 
00:28:58.909 --> 00:28:58.919 align:start position:0%
um but the bill is not the bill has not
 
00:29:00.529 --> 00:29:00.539 align:start position:0%
been through a public hearing and all of
 
00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
these concerns that the public has
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
raised they have not had the opportunity
 
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.210 align:start position:0%
raised they have not had the opportunity
yet

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:05.220 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
to express these at a public hearing or
 
00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
through the emails and phone calls that
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
we receive as members of this house and
 
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
yet they've been when we do have the
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
chance to go to our constituents they
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
haven't had the chance to read this bill
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
but they've heard about some of the
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
details and they hate it it's just
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
another it is just another taxpayer
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
subsidy low taxes are the result of low
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
spending and low spending can only
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
happen if we show the regular discipline
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
to vote no on these big spending items

whether it exists even that's what we're

voting on today why are we doing it this

considered Granite Staters need us to
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
so you may have seen advertisements
 
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
about a energy relief plan that does not
 
00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
exist the governor's 100 million dollar
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
relief program that is not before you
 
00:36:12.839 --> 00:36:13.670 align:start position:0%
relief program that is not before you
today

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
that would have sent a very small amount
 
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
of money to almost everybody
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
personally not speaking for everyone
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
else that seems like a meaningless
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
political gesture to me instead I wanted
 
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
to do something that was actually
 
00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
effective as did many others so if you
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
base this on the numbers right now the
 
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
LIHEAP program helps people with energy
 
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
and electric and fuel assistance that's
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
the low income heat energy assistance
 
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
program and it helps people up to 60
 
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
percent of the median income in New
 
00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.150 align:start position:0%
percent of the median income in New
Hampshire

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
but we have inflation we have Rising
 
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
costs so it seems reasonable that if you
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
are say 15 above that bracket that they
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
have right now you may be feeling like
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
the people in that bracket felt a couple
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
so it seems right to try to do at least
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
a slight correction and give those
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
people some assistance so what this bill
 
00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
does is gives them two hundred dollars
 
00:37:12.609 --> 00:37:12.619 align:start position:0%
for their electric bill
 
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.140 align:start position:0%
450 for their fuel oil which is a decent
 
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
amount of fuel oil
 
00:37:20.569 --> 00:37:20.579 align:start position:0%
it's not going to fix the problem but
 
00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
it's their money it's sitting in the
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
bank we might as well give it back to
 
00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
them it does them more good than it does
 
00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:28.130 align:start position:0%
them it does them more good than it does
us

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:28.140 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
there were arguments about well when you
 
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
do these handouts people will just spend
 
00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
it that's actually not a possibility
 
00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
with this bill the payments will go
 
00:37:38.329 --> 00:37:38.339 align:start position:0%
directly to the utility companies to the
 
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
electric company to the oil company so
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
nobody's getting a check that's not how
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
it works
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
it's a small amount of relief but it's
 
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
what we can do and like I said the
 
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
money's in the bank I'm never against
 
00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
giving the people their money back I
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
I forgot to mention on the last motion
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative Foster that cleared a
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest and did not
 
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.550 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest and did not
participate

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:17.220 align:start position:0%

esteemed colleagues
 
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
I rise today in support of the bill
 
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:25.380 align:start position:0%

00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
benefit for moderate income earners and
 
00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:34.220 align:start position:0%
additional funding for existing
 
00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:36.980 align:start position:0%
low-income electric assistance program
 
00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
the Eep
 
00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:41.579 align:start position:0%
uh in the governor's original press
 
00:38:41.579 --> 00:38:42.730 align:start position:0%
uh in the governor's original press
conference

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:42.740 align:start position:0%
conference
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
responding to the public utility
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
commission's approval of an electric
 
00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
price hike from 11 cents a kilowatt to
 
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
22 cents a kilowatt he announced a plan
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
to Credit One hundred dollars to every
 
00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
electric bill
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
payer in New Hampshire regardless of
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
need but the impact for Bill payers
 
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
according to eversource would be an
 
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
average of about seventy dollars per
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
month for six months so although the
 
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
chicken in every pot solution was an
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
easy one it was not adequate
 
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
then the speaker and others raised the
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
concerns about giving help to those who
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
really didn't need it and they suggested
 
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
that we also look at developing a state
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
funded heating assistance program so in
 
00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:32.579 align:start position:0%
addition to the federally funded
 
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
low-income fuel assistance program
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
Target those median income earners
 
00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
for whom utility rate increases could
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
mean the difference between Heating and
 
00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.170 align:start position:0%
mean the difference between Heating and
eating

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
eating
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
this effort the temporary State
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
emergency fuel assistance program was
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
designed to help the people above the
 
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
low-income assistance threshold of 60
 
00:39:58.569 --> 00:39:58.579 align:start position:0%
percent of median income as my colleague
 
00:40:01.849 --> 00:40:01.859 align:start position:0%
representative Smith just mentioned so
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
where we landed with the bill is that
 
00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
people who earn between 60 and 75
 
00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
percent of median income can now apply
 
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:14.060 align:start position:0%
for up to two hundred dollars or for 200
 
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
in electric assistance if they qualify
 
00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
they get the whole amount there's no
 
00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.270 align:start position:0%
they get the whole amount there's no
variable

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
variable
 
00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
and up to 450 in fuel assistance which
 
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
also includes people who have electric
 
00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
heat so it's not just oil and gas it's
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
if you're heating with electric you
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
would also be eligible
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
so that ends up being 650 dollars total
 
00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
in emergency utility bill assistance for
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
those middle income earners for both
 
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.130 align:start position:0%
those middle income earners for both
programs

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
now we have a concern that the number of
 
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
low-income electric assistants
 
00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
households is bigger than the funding
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
provided in this bill but there is an
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
additional seven million dollars that
 
00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
was added to bolster that fund which you
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
know we are hoping is going to go a long
 
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
way to helping those people in the low
 
00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
income category to meet their their
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
bills this this winter
 
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
so although very little help was sought
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
from my caucus and we would have helped
 
00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
we would have welcomed the chance for
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
further collaboration on this we are
 
00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
happy to say that we helped secure the
 
00:41:23.089 --> 00:41:23.099 align:start position:0%
increase in the state emergency electric
 
00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
assistance payout uh from 100 up to two
 
00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars per household
 
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
because that was the original problem
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
that we were trying to resolve was the
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
the increase in electric bills
 
00:41:37.609 --> 00:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
so we certainly would have preferred for
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
that to be closer to the 420 the average
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
person will pay in higher electric bills
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
over the six months this rate increase
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
will be in effect
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
um and we can work to implement energy
 
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
policies that would promote greater
 
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
Independence and Market competitions so
 
00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
that we have better Hedges against this
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a price spike in the future but
 
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
while there's more that we could do
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
there's always more that we can do
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
um and so that is why I'm asking for
 
00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:10.140 align:start position:0%
your support in passing this much needed
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
relief for granite Staters thanks
 
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
Independence which I recognize what I
 
00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:20.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.339 --> 00:42:24.890 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:31.940 align:start position:0%
I imagine many of you in this room
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
has just felt the Earth shake
 
00:42:40.609 --> 00:42:40.619 align:start position:0%
and the reason that the Earth has shaken
 
00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:42.500 align:start position:0%
is because
 
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
my esteemed colleague from Charlestown
 
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
and I who share a last name do not
 
00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.750 align:start position:0%
and I who share a last name do not
always

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
always
 
00:42:58.370 --> 00:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
share positions but today we do
 
00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:01.700 align:start position:0%
and we do
 
00:43:05.569 --> 00:43:05.579 align:start position:0%
recognizing for each of us that we
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
believe that we would rather light a
 
00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.589 align:start position:0%
believe that we would rather light a
candle

00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
candle
 
00:43:11.809 --> 00:43:11.819 align:start position:0%
than curse the darkness
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think either of us is thrilled
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
with this spill
 
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
I cannot speak and I wouldn't dare to
 
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
speak for my colleague from Charleston
 
00:43:26.349 --> 00:43:26.359 align:start position:0%
but I can speak for myself
 
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
this is a Band-Aid it is a short-term
 
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid it is not any more than that
 
00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:37.730 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid it is not any more than that
but

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:37.740 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
if you have scraped your knee
 
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
a Band-Aid helps
 
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
and many many of our constituents are
 
00:43:48.119 --> 00:43:49.370 align:start position:0%
and many many of our constituents are
struggling

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:49.380 align:start position:0%
struggling
 
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
have dramatically increased the charges
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
that will be felt by people at every
 
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
level every level of income
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
and the governor's initial proposal
 
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
thought the same relief for everybody
 
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
and that makes no sense the reason we
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
have government is because we believe
 
00:44:21.359 --> 00:44:23.390 align:start position:0%
have government is because we believe
together

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
we can create a life that is better
 
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
for all of us than if we each are on our
 
00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
own and that means that we have to look
 
00:44:38.569 --> 00:44:38.579 align:start position:0%
at the people who need the most help
 
00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
if I had my druthers I would begin by
 
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
changing the people who serve on the
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
I don't have much others
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
and I recognize that if I had my
 
00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
druthers I would not be favoring a
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
short-term six-month solution but a
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
long-term change in how we address the
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
very real problems that we will be
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
facing in this
 
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
City in this County in this state and
 
00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:16.859 align:start position:0%
this nation on how we deliver and what
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
we deliver to meet our energy needs but
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
today we have a short-term Band-Aid
 
00:45:28.569 --> 00:45:28.579 align:start position:0%
before an opportunity to do a little bit
 
00:45:32.569 --> 00:45:32.579 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to recognize
 
00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:35.220 align:start position:0%
I'm going to use a Chinese expression I
 
00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
hope no one then says I'm a Chinese
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
Communist sympathizer but I
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
some of you will get that joke
 
00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:44.990 align:start position:0%
some of you will get that joke
um

00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
I a journey of a Thousand Miles begins
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
with one step
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
and this is one step
 
00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.079 align:start position:0%
and the next step and the step after
 
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
that will be taken by the next
 
00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
legislature but to not take the first
 
00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
step today would be to deny a modicum of
 
00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
relief to people who desperately need it
 
00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
so I hope that you will join all the
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
Smiths in the legislature who will
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
I guess I have to change my name to
 
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:40.190 align:start position:0%
I guess I have to change my name to
Smith

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:46:44.569 --> 00:46:44.579 align:start position:0%
I will be representative Smith for the
 
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:47.220 align:start position:0%
next few moments if there's if there's
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
no objection
 
00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:52.819 align:start position:0%
I want people to understand
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
that in order to receive any of this
 
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
money the people will have to apply for
 
00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.490 align:start position:0%
money the people will have to apply for
it

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
so just because you earn within that 60
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
to 75 percent
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
of the median income doesn't mean I'm
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
going to send you
 
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
money to your fuel oil company you must
 
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
apply for it and so if you don't want to
 
00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:25.619 align:start position:0%
apply for it fine
 
00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
if you do want to apply for it great
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
so that's that's number one
 
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
number two I have heard Rumblings about
 
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.809 --> 00:47:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
the final figures for FY 22 will be
 
00:47:51.839 --> 00:47:53.329 align:start position:0%
the final figures for FY 22 will be
available

00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.339 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
uh right after 30 September
 
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
right now we still have with all this
 
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
money taken out
 
00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:08.220 align:start position:0%
we still have a surplus of a minimum of
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
120 million dollars
 
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
so those of you that want that money to
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
go to the rainy day fund will make that
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
decision after September
 
00:48:23.329 --> 00:48:23.339 align:start position:0%
but there is still Surplus money
 
00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
and in case you're not following what's
 
00:48:28.089 --> 00:48:28.099 align:start position:0%
going on in 23
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
July and August also had significant
 
00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.910 align:start position:0%
July and August also had significant
surpluses

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
surpluses
 
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
so we are not depleting under any
 
00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:41.940 align:start position:0%
circumstances the dollars that we have
 
00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
available to do good things in New
 
00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:45.829 align:start position:0%
available to do good things in New
Hampshire

00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
so I ask you to please support this
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
because you are helping your friends and
 
00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
your neighbors
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
you are not helping me
 
00:49:01.849 --> 00:49:01.859 align:start position:0%
because my family income is greater than
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand just in case you
 
00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:05.540 align:start position:0%
wanted to know
 
00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:08.220 align:start position:0%
if you didn't want to know that's okay
 
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
too but so it's no no Financial benefit
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
but I do ask that you support this for
 
00:49:26.089 --> 00:49:26.099 align:start position:0%
everyone in your community and in your

bill 52 shall become law despite the
 
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
governor's veto of the bill
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
House Bill 52 pertains to apportioning
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
congressional district
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
the bill passed the house by a very
 
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
small margin in fact the motion to table
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
the bill uh failed by just one vote
 
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
and the bill was sent to the governor's
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
desk even though he said if it reached
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
his desk he would veto it and he did
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
just that
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
the state's primary elections are behind
 
00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:30.109 align:start position:0%
the state's primary elections are behind
us

00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
voters in the first congressional
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
district have chosen their candidates
 
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
Democrats have nominated Chris Pappas
 
00:52:38.569 --> 00:52:38.579 align:start position:0%
Republicans have dominated Caroline
 
00:52:38.579 --> 00:52:40.309 align:start position:0%
Republicans have dominated Caroline
Levitt

00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
Levitt
 
00:52:43.549 --> 00:52:43.559 align:start position:0%
if we override the governor's veto
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
neither of those candidates will be
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
residents of the district that they seek
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
to represent
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
because neither of those candidates
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
would be residents within the proposed
 
00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
boundaries of the first congressional
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
district under house bill 52.
 
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
the Court's Congressional map moved five
 
00:53:03.049 --> 00:53:03.059 align:start position:0%
towns and about 9 000 people from One
 
00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:04.859 align:start position:0%
District to the other
 
00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
House Bill 52 would have moved more than
 
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
a half million people from 29 cities and
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
towns to another District that's more
 
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:14.220 align:start position:0%
than 36 percent of the state's
 
00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.650 align:start position:0%
than 36 percent of the state's
population

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:17.579 align:start position:0%
thus many of the voters who supported
 
00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
Chris Pappas or Caroline Levitt in the
 
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
primary would not have an opportunity to
 
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
vote for them in November
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
that's not fair to our voters or
 
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
respectful of their wishes
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
with less than nine weeks to go before
 
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
the general election now is not the time
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
to alter the congressional districts by
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
overriding The veto on House Bill 52. as
 
00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
such police press the red no button to
 
00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I rise
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
in support of HB 52 notwithstanding the
 
00:54:02.089 --> 00:54:02.099 align:start position:0%
governor's veto the proposed map is not
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
perfect nothing made by man is
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
yet it's done about as well as any
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
committee could Benjamin Franklin said
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
after Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
Independence was re being Rewritten that
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
he had made it a point never to drop any
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
important document that was later to be
 
00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:18.660 align:start position:0%

committee
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
it's been said that Franklin was not
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
chosen to drop the original draft of the
 
00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
Declaration because he might conceal a
 
00:54:26.809 --> 00:54:26.819 align:start position:0%
joke within it
 
00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:28.859 align:start position:0%
but if all the plans drawn up by various
 
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
groups and committees this map is the
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
best or at least it is the least bad
 
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker the famous salamander shape
 
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
District in Massachusetts that gave rise
 
00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:41.579 align:start position:0%
to the term gerrymander
 
00:54:43.609 --> 00:54:43.619 align:start position:0%
has the top of that creature's head
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
right on my property in Seabrook and
 
00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:46.910 align:start position:0%
right on my property in Seabrook and
Salisbury

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
Salisbury
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%
for 170 years to
 
00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
bring some of you back through some of
 
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
the history of this many voters
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
supported Republicans and Republicans
 
00:54:58.490 --> 00:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
campaigned on this for a very long time
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
precisely because we did not
 
00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered districts but produce maps
 
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
that were fair or Fair
 
00:55:07.849 --> 00:55:07.859 align:start position:0%
more independent and more competitive
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
that is they were as good as they could
 
00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:11.690 align:start position:0%
that is they were as good as they could
be

00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:55:14.329 --> 00:55:14.339 align:start position:0%
and we pointed out the dangers in those
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
years of gerrymandering which uh as the
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
other side had said earlier Southern
 
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
Democrats had used to lock up Southern
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
legislatures until the 21st century
 
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
this proposed map is better because it
 
00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:32.700 align:start position:0%
leaves two competitive districts and two
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
relatively compact districts in facing
 
00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
the reality of the usual midterm
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
backlash which we must consider from the
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
party that holds the White House polling
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
indicates that it's unlikely that
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
members of the minority caucus will have
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
as much impact next year so I'm asking
 
00:55:49.609 --> 00:55:49.619 align:start position:0%
members of the minority to give serious
 
00:55:58.790 --> 00:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is
 
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
the motion to override the governance so
 
00:56:07.609 --> 00:56:07.619 align:start position:0%
you know on HB 52 state constitution
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
requires a roll call two-thirds vote is
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
required to override a veto if you're in
 
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:15.300 align:start position:0%

00:56:17.089 --> 00:56:17.099 align:start position:0%

00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a roll call Members
 
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:31.800 --> 00:57:15.890 align:start position:0%

00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
the motion before members take their
 
00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
seats the motion before us is whether we
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
it requires a con Constitution requires
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:59:35.089 --> 00:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
I always say 4 colon 45 without this
 
00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:36.780 align:start position:0%
bill empowers the general court to
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
terminate in an emergency order or an
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
executive order by majority vote
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
this is a power that we're already
 
00:59:47.089 --> 00:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
that we already have
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
and that this bill does not increase or
 
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
diminish the current power that we have
 
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
we're all adults we are representatives
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
of our constituents we call we come to
 
01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:02.220 align:start position:0%
conquer when called by the speaker
 
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:04.260 align:start position:0%
and there's no further action needed on
 
01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr Speaker I I rise today
 
01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:19.859 align:start position:0%
to talk to everyone who's taken an oath
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
to our Constitution
 
01:00:25.849 --> 01:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
and just as a basic reminder of our
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
constitutional framework establishes
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
that the power that is is used on behalf
 
01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
of the people rests with the legislature
 
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
we pass the laws and then after we pass
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
them the executive can agree or disagree
 
01:00:47.569 --> 01:00:47.579 align:start position:0%
but the power of the people rests in the
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
legislature and what what we've found
 
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
ourselves in a situation is that the way
 
01:00:57.069 --> 01:00:57.079 align:start position:0%
HB 275
 
01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:01.559 align:start position:0%
is is resting based on this veto is that
 
01:01:05.089 --> 01:01:05.099 align:start position:0%
the governor the executive branch has
 
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
too much power an unconstitutional
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
amount of power I think we all can agree
 
01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:13.140 align:start position:0%
that there's a reasonable amount of time
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
that the executive must act in an
 
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
emergency and we've said for the purpose
 
01:01:21.049 --> 01:01:21.059 align:start position:0%
of this bill that it's uh 90 days or
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me 84 days the 90 days is the War
 
01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
Powers Act which limits the president's
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
authority to deploy military force for
 
01:01:31.849 --> 01:01:31.859 align:start position:0%
90 days before the Congress must be
 
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
informed and have an opportunity to act
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
and and so why did Congress do that and
 
01:01:39.049 --> 01:01:39.059 align:start position:0%
why should we override this veto it's
 
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
for the same reason
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
the power of the people rests in the
 
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
legislature when separation of powers
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
was created at the founding it was
 
01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
thought that each body within the
 
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
government would jealously exercise its
 
01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.690 align:start position:0%
government would jealously exercise its
prerogatives

01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
prerogatives
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
and so I would ask you today not on
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
behalf of us but on behalf of future
 
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
legislatures to jealously guard our
 
01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
legislative prerogative and
 
01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:11.270 align:start position:0%
legislative prerogative and
um

01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
override this veto so that the
 
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
legislature must permit the executive
 
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
branch to continue extraordinary
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
emergency Powers Beyond an initial 84
 
01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.730 align:start position:0%
emergency Powers Beyond an initial 84
days

01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:25.740 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:02:29.569 --> 01:02:29.579 align:start position:0%
I think 84 days should be enough to to
 
01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
deal with a lot of emergencies and
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
certainly if it's going to last beyond
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
84 days the people need an opportunity
 
01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
to speak and we speak on behalf of the
 
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
people so I'm going to ask for a roll
 
01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
call I'm also going to ask that you vote
 
01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:48.660 align:start position:0%

also be in order
 
01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the governor's real cell
 
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
HP 275 become law
 
01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:04.020 align:start position:0%

01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
if I know that HB 275 would permit the

governor to declare a state of emergency
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
for up to 84 days without action by this

01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
than that after the Declaration of even
 
01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
the recent unprecedented emergency
 
01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
and if I know that there is a tremendous
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
difference between this legislature
 
01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
having the power to act and having the
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
duty to act as required by our
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
constitution as representatives of the
 
01:06:06.289 --> 01:06:06.299 align:start position:0%
people when it might be easier to shirk
 
01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
that Duty and hit leave the hard
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
decisions to the governor and finally if
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
I know that a state of emergency is a
 
01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
truly extraordinary thing that it is the
 
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
suspension of this constitutionally
 
01:06:20.809 --> 01:06:20.819 align:start position:0%

now it's system measure or brother
 
01:09:05.329 --> 01:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
measure HP
 
01:09:09.289 --> 01:09:09.299 align:start position:0%
319 that we're looking at here uh asked
 
01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
for the same thing to happen for college
 
01:09:10.739 --> 01:09:13.010 align:start position:0%
for the same thing to happen for college
students

01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
um now we first want to thank the
 
01:09:16.669 --> 01:09:16.679 align:start position:0%
governor for meeting directly with me
 
01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
and a co-sponsor showing us the respect
 
01:09:21.169 --> 01:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
to convey his concerns one of the
 
01:09:23.329 --> 01:09:23.339 align:start position:0%
concerns was if
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
the high school students have already
 
01:09:27.169 --> 01:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
passed it why why do the college
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
students need to pass and quickly
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
there's several answers to that
 
01:09:34.090 --> 01:09:34.100 align:start position:0%
half the UNH students from out of state
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
many of the community college students
 
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
and I'll also say I spent 12 years in
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
the University system I spent 20 years
 
01:09:47.329 --> 01:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
in the community college system and I
 
01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
can tell you that this bill is important
 
01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
and is needed now when the the bill had
 
01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
a hearing the both the university system
 
01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
and the community college system were
 
01:09:58.729 --> 01:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
neutral they did not take a position but
 
01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
an accreditation agency official was
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
deployed and who Darkly warned uh or
 
01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
shared some misinformation she said this
 
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
could cost 750 a test not true uh the
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
test is free it's it's part of the uh uh
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
the public domain
 
01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
um it could be done online it could be
 
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
done as many times as necessary for a
 
01:10:26.209 --> 01:10:26.219 align:start position:0%
student to uh to pass the test
 
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
then it was later stated and repeated on
 
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall that we'd be
 
01:10:32.689 --> 01:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
the first state in the country to have
 
01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:35.699 align:start position:0%
such a measure as this uh also untrue
 
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
there's around 20 states that have
 
01:10:40.209 --> 01:10:40.219 align:start position:0%
similar requirements for college
 
01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
graduates to Simply pass a citizenship
 
01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:44.149 align:start position:0%
graduates to Simply pass a citizenship
test

01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
test
 
01:10:44.159 --> 01:10:45.770 align:start position:0%
test
uh

01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:45.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
indeed after this body first past 319
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
last year it got a great deal of
 
01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.850 align:start position:0%
last year it got a great deal of
attention

01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
it was in the newspapers and there were
 
01:10:58.130 --> 01:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
some polls one poll showed that 80
 
01:11:01.729 --> 01:11:01.739 align:start position:0%
percent of the uh New Hampshire
 
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
residents supported the notion of having
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
college students pass this as a
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
but the most egregious message that the
 
01:11:15.169 --> 01:11:15.179 align:start position:0%
accreditation person The Hired Gun so to
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
speak had to do with her message this is
 
01:11:17.159 --> 01:11:18.229 align:start position:0%
speak had to do with her message this is
important

01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
it's all important but this is
 
01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
particularly important to you and to us
 
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
I'm going to paraphrase what she said
 
01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
but her message was you can't tell us
 
01:11:28.729 --> 01:11:28.739 align:start position:0%
what to do
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
now think about that
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
you can't tell us what to do
 
01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
talk about the need for civics lesson
 
01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
that the that mentality of you can't
 
01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:42.780 align:start position:0%
tell us what to do should concern every
 
01:11:45.169 --> 01:11:45.179 align:start position:0%
one of us
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
if if you agree with that that you can
 
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
go ahead and press the red button
 
01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.990 align:start position:0%
go ahead and press the red button
but

01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:11:53.330 --> 01:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
the people and the peoples elected
 
01:11:56.689 --> 01:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
representatives which is you and us if
 
01:11:58.610 --> 01:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
we think that this is important and if
 
01:12:01.370 --> 01:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
we want college graduates to to show
 
01:12:05.330 --> 01:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
this uh competency then uh yeah we can
 
01:12:07.729 --> 01:12:07.739 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
it's a bipartisan bill
 
01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
one staunch supporter was a great friend
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
of of most all of us the late Democratic
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
representative from Manchester
 
01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
who sat in seat
 
01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
5 24.
 
01:12:27.649 --> 01:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
empty today of course we lost our last
 
01:12:27.659 --> 01:12:29.510 align:start position:0%
empty today of course we lost our last
December

01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
December
 
01:12:32.209 --> 01:12:32.219 align:start position:0%
but she spent a lifetime in education
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
and she understood the importance of
 
01:12:39.169 --> 01:12:39.179 align:start position:0%
civics fundamentals to good citizenship
 
01:12:42.169 --> 01:12:42.179 align:start position:0%
she actually offered a pi to HB 320 last
 
01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
year when we passed past that one
 
01:12:47.209 --> 01:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
so overturning a veto is and should be a
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
heavy lift that's Civics but I encourage
 
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
my colleagues to again again vote for HB
 
01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
319 to send the right message to the
 
01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:55.850 align:start position:0%
319 to send the right message to the
people

01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
that we hear their desire
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
that a college degree means more than
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
maybe it does now
 
01:13:05.930 --> 01:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
passing this would increase the value of
 
01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
a college diploma it would increase
 
01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
public support for college education
 
01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
so the great entrepreneur Jim Rohn said
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
ignorance is not Bliss ignorance is
 
01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
poverty ignorance is Devastation
 
01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
ignorance is tragedy this bill would
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
strike a mighty blow a significant blow
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
against ignorance and they ask that you
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
again vote for it thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I rise
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
in support of HB 319 and uh uh in spite
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
of the governor's veto
 
01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:47.699 align:start position:0%
requiring that Civics be taught for
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
University students the governor
 
01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
recognizes that we recently on a near
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
party line vote added the teaching of
 
01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
civics to our graduation requirements
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
already that much is true
 
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
in fact over a hundred years ago
 
01:14:03.050 --> 01:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh that was one of the promises made by
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
socialist and Progressive activists who
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
marched and paraded in the 19 teens and
 
01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:09.780 align:start position:0%
20s to justify changing from private
 
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
tuition-funded schools to tax-funded
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
government schooling
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
though some recent high school graduates
 
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
couldn't find the Bill of Rights nor
 
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
know its contents because that promise
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
largely has not been kept and I'm sorry
 
01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
to say that that is still true of some
 
01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
of my generation
 
01:14:30.050 --> 01:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
I hate to admit it but it is true
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
from Colonial times to almost World War
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
II Those Old Brick private schools were
 
01:14:36.410 --> 01:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
six grade levels ahead of today's
 
01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
government schools the problem with the
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
reasoning in sununa's veto message as it
 
01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
ignores the fact that over 43 percent of
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
unh's students come from out of state
 
01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
and many more of our continuing
 
01:14:50.689 --> 01:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
education students are adults who never
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
went to high school in New Hampshire I
 
01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:54.540 align:start position:0%

our constitution
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
nor understand why the framers saw the

Second Amendment as being so important a
 
01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
degree from a New Hampshire University
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%

sending students out into the world who
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%

ivermectin and covid does not exist
 
01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
this is not to say that Ivermectin is
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
not a good drug it is excellent for the
 
01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
treatment of parasitic worms but
 
01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
efficacy in covid is not proven
 
01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
you will hear claims that over a hundred
 
01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
Studies have shown Ivermectin to be
 
01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
helpful in reducing the severity and
 
01:20:45.050 --> 01:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
duration of covid-19 but this is simply

you will hear claims that over 100

Studies have shown Ivermectin to be
 
01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%

studies regarding Ivermectin that sound
 
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:22.140 align:start position:0%

and then have that Authority's sunset
 
01:22:52.729 --> 01:22:52.739 align:start position:0%
July 1 2024 and it created a commission
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%

the authorization for a standing order
 
01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
should be renewed well that's totally
 
01:23:03.239 --> 01:23:04.610 align:start position:0%
should be renewed well that's totally
backwards

01:23:04.610 --> 01:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
backwards
 
01:23:06.850 --> 01:23:06.860 align:start position:0%
it is inappropriate to legislatively
 
01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
pretend there is a consensus
 
01:23:12.410 --> 01:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
and then evaluate to see if one actually
 
01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:14.570 align:start position:0%
and then evaluate to see if one actually
exists

01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
exists
 
01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
if it is determined by quality studies
 
01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:18.300 align:start position:0%
that Ivermectin has a place in treating
 
01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
covet at some point in the disease
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
process it will gladly commonly become
 
01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:26.030 align:start position:0%
process it will gladly commonly become
prescribed

01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
prescribed
 
01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
so the point is the governor is correct
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
in vetoing this bill and his veto
 
01:23:31.850 --> 01:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
message States
 
01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
quote the state currently has only four
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%

order standing order
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
all drugs and medications should be
 
01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
subjected to that same rigorous process

order
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
end quote
 
01:24:10.970 --> 01:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
Ivermectin fails that process of
 
01:24:12.649 --> 01:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
rigorous review
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
and as he pointed out Ivermectin can
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
still be prescribed off-label by a
 
01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
provider if that is desired by the
 
01:24:21.649 --> 01:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
provider and the patient
 
01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
so in summary
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
standing orders with pharmacists should
 
01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
not be used to dispense medications for
 
01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
indications which are not clearly
 
01:24:33.890 --> 01:24:33.900 align:start position:0%

evidence
 
01:24:37.550 --> 01:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
and Ivermectin does not reach that level
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
of evidence
 
01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:41.219 align:start position:0%
the governor's veto should not be
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
overridden we should let high quality
 
01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
research guide the practice of medicine
 
01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
we should not legislate the practice of
 
01:24:53.570 --> 01:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
medicine so please press red to vote no
 
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:56.280 align:start position:0%

but the New Hampshire GOP platform

our Declaration of Independence

anything like that a doctor nothing like
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
that I'm an old morning that breaks
 
01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:15.780 align:start position:0%
stuff but anyways I did a Google search
 
01:27:18.169 --> 01:27:18.179 align:start position:0%
while I'm sitting in the seat and I look
 
01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
at everyone that's using I remember
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
medicine it seems like this medication
 
01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
do you know if this is being used that
 
01:27:27.649 --> 01:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
the doctor in Congress is issuing it to
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
Congressional people and rich people are
 
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
getting hold of this medicine but the
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
poor people are being shut down on this
 
01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.550 align:start position:0%
poor people are being shut down on this
medication

01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
medication
 
01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
I've I've been told that but I haven't
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
been given names of politicians and
 
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
wealthy people but I I do know that uh
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
the common people are being deprived of
 
01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:47.820 align:start position:0%
a lot of the uh leading medication in
 
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
fact that was admitted by uh Senator Ted
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
Kennedy of Massachusetts that because of
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
his connections he was able to get
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
access to much better Medical Care than
 
01:27:57.649 --> 01:27:57.659 align:start position:0%
the rest of us thank you thank you for
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%

01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is notwithstanding
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's veto show HB 1022 will
 
01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:13.620 align:start position:0%

01:30:00.290 --> 01:30:00.300 align:start position:0%

01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
if I know that standing orders with
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
pharmacists should not be used to
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
dispense medications for indications
 
01:30:17.330 --> 01:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
which are not clearly supported by the
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
best available medical evidence
 
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
and if I know that Ivermectin does not
 
01:30:24.050 --> 01:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
reach this level of evidence
 
01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
and if I know that if a person wants to
 
01:30:30.290 --> 01:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
take Ivermectin or wishes to give it to
 
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
their child
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
they have every right to have that
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
discussion with their medical provider
 
01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
who can prescribe it off label as this
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
bill only prevents a pharmacist from
 
01:30:46.669 --> 01:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
dispensing Ivermectin by standing order
 
01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
it does not preclude having a
 
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
conversation with your doctor and
 
01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
getting a prescription if you so desire
 
01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
and if I know that we should not
 
01:30:56.810 --> 01:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
legislate the practice of medicine but
 
01:30:58.370 --> 01:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
rather we should let high quality
 
01:31:01.090 --> 01:31:01.100 align:start position:0%
research guide the practice of medicine
 
01:31:05.330 --> 01:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
would I then press red to vote no on the
 
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
motion to override The veto of
 
01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:11.340 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
if I know that contrary to The veto
 
01:31:23.450 --> 01:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
message taking Ivermectin does not limit
 
01:31:26.090 --> 01:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
future treatment options
 
01:31:28.370 --> 01:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
and if I know that pharmacists are the
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
professionals that are best trained to
 
01:31:32.330 --> 01:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
assess an individual's risk and their
 
01:31:34.850 --> 01:31:34.860 align:start position:0%
medication interactions just as is
 
01:31:37.010 --> 01:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
commonly done in Europe
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
and lastly if I know that if if
 
01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
Ivermectin is helpful it is helpful
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
early and wasting valuable time waiting
 
01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:46.679 align:start position:0%

the face mask bill
 
01:34:02.270 --> 01:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
I had several requests to file this bill
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
for mothers who were frustrated to get
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
trying to teach young children to
 
01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
properly wear masks
 
01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
they were also asking why the students
 
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
were still required to mask up after the
 
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
mask requirement for the rest of us was
 
01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:17.330 align:start position:0%

we had hours of testimony in both the

01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:39.060 align:start position:0%
testified we heard from a scientist who
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
pointed out that the children were the
 
01:34:44.330 --> 01:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
least susceptible to the covet virus and
 
01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
that no members of this group had had a

serious attack nor had any member died
 
01:34:51.169 --> 01:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
in this group
 
01:34:54.050 --> 01:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
speech pathologists testified that it
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
had set back speech therapy for a year
 
01:34:58.970 --> 01:34:58.980 align:start position:0%

bill
 
01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
of all the hypocrisies he says this
 
01:35:12.649 --> 01:35:12.659 align:start position:0%
should be a local decision
 
01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
did he not read the bill
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
local in my mind that I believe in your
 
01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
minds is that the parents are the right
 
01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
decision makers not the school board the
 
01:35:23.629 --> 01:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
school board never claimed any
 
01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:25.860 align:start position:0%
scientific reason for their rulings or
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
why children need masks when no one else
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
was required to wear them
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
even in a language in his veto message
 
01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
to quote
 
01:35:39.410 --> 01:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
the state must remain steadfast in
 
01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
protecting local control as decisions
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
like this are best left to authorities
 
01:35:47.209 --> 01:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
closest to parents and families where
 
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
they can work with their neighbors to
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%

01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
yes that's what we're saying in this
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
bill parents should decide
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
let's send the message that this sick
 
01:36:00.410 --> 01:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
legislation believes that when a local
 
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
decision is needed that we believe that
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
local decision is made at the family
 
01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
level and not by an unelected
 
01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:08.990 align:start position:0%

there were people here on the Plaza
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
we've had petitions this is a bill that
 
01:40:57.010 --> 01:40:57.020 align:start position:0%
has enormous
 
01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm around the state
 
01:41:04.129 --> 01:41:04.139 align:start position:0%
it's a bipartisan bill it was from the
 
01:41:04.139 --> 01:41:05.149 align:start position:0%
it's a bipartisan bill it was from the
outset

01:41:05.149 --> 01:41:05.159 align:start position:0%
outset
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
there were people in Northern New
 
01:41:07.199 --> 01:41:08.090 align:start position:0%
there were people in Northern New
Hampshire

01:41:08.090 --> 01:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:41:10.430 --> 01:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
who were very concerned about the issue
 
01:41:12.410 --> 01:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
of landfills
 
01:41:15.169 --> 01:41:15.179 align:start position:0%
small groups of people gathered then
 
01:41:18.110 --> 01:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
those groups grew to larger groups
 
01:41:20.570 --> 01:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
there was an effort between the house
 
01:41:23.209 --> 01:41:23.219 align:start position:0%
and the Senate there were people who
 
01:41:27.649 --> 01:41:27.659 align:start position:0%
joined groups we had wired articles at
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
Town meetings supporting this idea
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
and we moved across town lines then
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
across county lines and now it's become
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
clear that this is a Statewide issue
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
this last year we have learned a lot
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
more about contaminants and groundwater
 
01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
and pfas and bacteria and all these
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
things we don't really like to think
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
about that can happen under our feet
 
01:42:01.250 --> 01:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
when we can't see it we think everything
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
is fine and it's not fine
 
01:42:09.530 --> 01:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
now at the last minute we're hearing
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
rumbles that there are claims that this
 
01:42:19.250 --> 01:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
bill will affect potential expansions of
 
01:42:22.370 --> 01:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
existing landfills but that's just not
 
01:42:25.729 --> 01:42:25.739 align:start position:0%
true there's a key sentence in this bill
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
which I want to read to you
 
01:42:32.330 --> 01:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
nothing in this paragraph of this bill
 
01:42:35.209 --> 01:42:35.219 align:start position:0%
shall be construed to prohibit the
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
expansion of any landfills that are in
 
01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
operation at the time this paragraph
 
01:42:44.810 --> 01:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
takes place this is very important this
 
01:42:47.090 --> 01:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
makes it so this bill is something that
 
01:42:48.910 --> 01:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
can be passed now
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
to deal with an imminent problem
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
and to protect our very precious Waters
 
01:42:59.149 --> 01:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
all over the state
 
01:43:02.090 --> 01:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
as the prime sponsor let me assure you
 
01:43:05.149 --> 01:43:05.159 align:start position:0%
that it was always my intention as well
 
01:43:08.209 --> 01:43:08.219 align:start position:0%
of the bipartisan sponsors in the House
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
and Senate to craft a bill that applied
 
01:43:15.169 --> 01:43:15.179 align:start position:0%
only to new landfills we believe we've
 
01:43:18.770 --> 01:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
succeeded and that it is impossible to
 
01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
read that sentence any other way we have
 
01:43:25.129 --> 01:43:25.139 align:start position:0%
concurrence on a phone conversation that
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
was lengthy with director wimsat and I
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
assure you that there is nothing here
 
01:43:38.209 --> 01:43:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:40.810 --> 01:43:40.820 align:start position:0%
at the moment
 
01:43:45.169 --> 01:43:45.179 align:start position:0%
three Republican speakers are ready to
 
01:43:46.850 --> 01:43:46.860 align:start position:0%

01:43:52.209 --> 01:43:52.219 align:start position:0%

01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
upon failure is irresponsible
 
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
the Bill's five-year travel criteria
 
01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
enables detection and Remediation
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%

01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:56.030 align:start position:0%
to be well ahead of a contaminant

01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
leakage
 
01:46:00.410 --> 01:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
and migration to surface waters
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
then did the arbitrary 200 feet
 
01:46:07.490 --> 01:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
existing law which just might not be
 
01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:08.450 align:start position:0%
existing law which just might not be
enough

01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:46:11.570 --> 01:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
buffer to preclude polluting or surface
 
01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:13.669 align:start position:0%

01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
waters
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
the time and travel protocol is a
 
01:46:20.090 --> 01:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
science-based answer to uncertainty
 
01:46:22.970 --> 01:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
has been utilized in other states to
 
01:46:26.810 --> 01:46:26.820 align:start position:0%
assure sufficient setback relative to
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
various soil and strata conditions
 
01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
this technology approach
 
01:46:36.229 --> 01:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
has been increasing in use since 2003
 
01:46:39.290 --> 01:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
and our neighbor State May a state of
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
Maine has used it successfully for 15
 
01:46:43.199 --> 01:46:44.510 align:start position:0%
Maine has used it successfully for 15
years

01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
The veto note
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
mandates that the Department of
 
01:46:58.209 --> 01:46:58.219 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
01:47:03.609 --> 01:47:03.619 align:start position:0%
contract with an engineer or hydrolysist
 
01:47:08.209 --> 01:47:08.219 align:start position:0%
pursuant the SB 396 reference in it
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
when evaluating a landfill permit
 
01:47:16.609 --> 01:47:16.619 align:start position:0%
well that's fine but it sorely Lacks two
 
01:47:16.619 --> 01:47:18.350 align:start position:0%
well that's fine but it sorely Lacks two
things

01:47:18.350 --> 01:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
the qualification of the engineer or
 
01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:23.330 align:start position:0%
the qualification of the engineer or
hydrologist

01:47:23.330 --> 01:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
hydrologist
 
01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
and this and the specific
 
01:47:30.590 --> 01:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
process that should be involved
 
01:47:32.930 --> 01:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
it is therefore inadequate for the
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
purpose of really protecting the waters
 
01:47:43.609 --> 01:47:43.619 align:start position:0%
HP 1454 fulfills that fills that Gap
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
provide scientific process for
 
01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:48.109 align:start position:0%
provide scientific process for
protection

01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
protection
 
01:47:52.250 --> 01:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
and we should enact it into law
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
so I ask you to please press
 
01:48:00.169 --> 01:48:00.179 align:start position:0%
the green button to enable this bill to
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
enter into law and protect our precious
 
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
Water Resources
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
water is life thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:48:17.810 --> 01:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:20.169 --> 01:48:20.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:48:22.129 --> 01:48:22.139 align:start position:0%
my colleague did a wonderful job
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
explaining the content of the bill so I
 
01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
won't take much of your time this
 
01:48:27.410 --> 01:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
morning other than to say when the spill
 
01:48:29.330 --> 01:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
last came to this chamber it passed on a
 
01:48:32.209 --> 01:48:32.219 align:start position:0%
unanimous Voice vote and uh
 
01:48:33.530 --> 01:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
it seems like there are some Rumblings
 
01:48:36.530 --> 01:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
and some changing of opinion uh and and
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
in fact it might seem strange that I
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
would be up here arguing for this bill
 
01:48:42.050 --> 01:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
this override of this veto in the first
 
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
place because on my side of the aisle we
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
we value very highly free markets and
 
01:48:49.970 --> 01:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
low regulation and allowing businesses
 
01:48:52.010 --> 01:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
to do what businesses do and we believe
 
01:48:54.109 --> 01:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
that because we believe that if we let
 
01:48:55.850 --> 01:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
people do what they do best then All
 
01:48:58.250 --> 01:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
Ships rise and the standard of living of
 
01:49:00.890 --> 01:49:00.900 align:start position:0%
all people will rise as we allow people
 
01:49:03.410 --> 01:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
to do what they do best but of course I
 
01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
would almost never go against those
 
01:49:06.169 --> 01:49:06.179 align:start position:0%
principles but all things have
 
01:49:06.179 --> 01:49:07.490 align:start position:0%
principles but all things have
exceptions

01:49:07.490 --> 01:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
and I believe that this bill presents an
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
exception to that rule
 
01:49:14.270 --> 01:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
and uh I'd just like to remind my
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
friends in this chamber that earlier
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
this year I suspended my convictions of
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
those rules as well to help the people
 
01:49:22.669 --> 01:49:22.679 align:start position:0%
of Merrimack
 
01:49:24.290 --> 01:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
um because their waterways were
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
compromised and we stepped in and and we
 
01:49:30.649 --> 01:49:30.659 align:start position:0%
required of business to remediate
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
problems due to their waterways because
 
01:49:34.850 --> 01:49:34.860 align:start position:0%
without water you don't have anything
 
01:49:36.890 --> 01:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't matter how highly we
 
01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
Elevate the standard of living of people
 
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
if they don't have clean water to work
 
01:49:42.890 --> 01:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
with then they don't have anything
 
01:49:44.930 --> 01:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
so coming from the North Country we're
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
not opposed to more landfills you know
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
when a few of my colleagues have said
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
well yeah you know you don't mind citing
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
landfills unless it's in your backyard I
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
have one in my backyard I've had one in
 
01:49:55.250 --> 01:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
my backyard for for 20 years I know what
 
01:49:56.570 --> 01:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
it's like to have a landfill in your
 
01:49:58.010 --> 01:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
backyard we're not opposed to having
 
01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
landfills in the North Country have two
 
01:50:01.609 --> 01:50:01.619 align:start position:0%
operating at the moment
 
01:50:03.709 --> 01:50:03.719 align:start position:0%
um all we want is for those landfills to
 
01:50:06.770 --> 01:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
be uh situated reasonably away from our
 
01:50:08.810 --> 01:50:08.820 align:start position:0%
water sources
 
01:50:10.910 --> 01:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
our environment is the basis of our
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
economy up there if we ruin our
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
waterways people don't come hunt they
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
don't come fish they don't come do water
 
01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:19.250 align:start position:0%
don't come fish they don't come do water
sports

01:50:19.250 --> 01:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
sports
 
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
if if our fish are compromised if our
 
01:50:24.770 --> 01:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
animals are compromised it does great
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
damage to our economy in the North
 
01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
country and so we're just we're just
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
asking for common sense legislation we
 
01:50:31.129 --> 01:50:31.139 align:start position:0%
don't mind setting under the landfill we
 
01:50:33.530 --> 01:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
just want it adequately separated from
 
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:35.639 align:start position:0%
our waterways so that our waterways uh
 
01:50:37.370 --> 01:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
can can remain safe
 
01:50:39.229 --> 01:50:39.239 align:start position:0%
um I hope that you will see this the way
 
01:50:40.490 --> 01:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
that I do
 
01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
um that you will vote green to overturn
 
01:50:45.770 --> 01:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
the governor's veto on hpe 1454 uh help
 
01:50:47.149 --> 01:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
us protect our waterways for the future
 
01:50:50.689 --> 01:50:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:56.209 --> 01:50:56.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
this is my last day
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is one more step toward
 
01:51:07.149 --> 01:51:07.159 align:start position:0%
aligning our New Hampshire Des
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
rsas with good engineering practices for
 
01:51:15.050 --> 01:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
safe landfills my son-in-law bills them
 
01:51:18.530 --> 01:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1454 does not apply to
 
01:51:21.530 --> 01:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
existing landfills it only applies to
 
01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:23.820 align:start position:0%
landfills yet to be built
 
01:51:25.850 --> 01:51:25.860 align:start position:0%
and there's no pressing need to build
 
01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
more of them right now
 
01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
this bill allows expanding the ones that
 
01:51:32.450 --> 01:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
we already have
 
01:51:34.850 --> 01:51:34.860 align:start position:0%
the mount Carberry landfill just
 
01:51:37.250 --> 01:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
received approval to expand through
 
01:51:37.260 --> 01:51:39.109 align:start position:0%
received approval to expand through
2041.

01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
2041.
 
01:51:41.689 --> 01:51:41.699 align:start position:0%
the Nashua Four Hills landfill is
 
01:51:44.689 --> 01:51:44.699 align:start position:0%
currently seeking a 30-year expansion
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
through to 2052.
 
01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
and when we do need more trash capacity
 
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services has shown that 86
 
01:51:57.970 --> 01:51:57.980 align:start position:0%
percent of land in New Hampshire is
 
01:52:00.649 --> 01:52:00.659 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologically suitable for sighting
 
01:52:02.209 --> 01:52:02.219 align:start position:0%
a new landfill
 
01:52:04.970 --> 01:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
currently requiring only 200 feet
 
01:52:07.729 --> 01:52:07.739 align:start position:0%
between a landfill and a water body
 
01:52:09.590 --> 01:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
reveals a lack of concern about
 
01:52:13.790 --> 01:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
hydrology and soil infiltration we've
 
01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
come a long way from The Superficial
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
claims that clay liners last forever and
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
landfill leaching poses no dangers to
 
01:52:25.850 --> 01:52:25.860 align:start position:0%
our lakes and rivers and Coastal Waters
 
01:52:28.490 --> 01:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
we cannot risk having more leaks such as
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
occurred at the Bethlehem landfill in
 
01:52:34.970 --> 01:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
May last year endangering the man a man
 
01:52:36.970 --> 01:52:36.980 align:start position:0%
I practiced
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
amnestic River New Hampshire has already
 
01:52:44.209 --> 01:52:44.219 align:start position:0%
has its share of Superfund sites
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
based on hydraulic conductivity tests
 
01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
this bill requires that any landfill
 
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
proposal near a perennial river lake or
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%

Liberty Alliance which normally takes uh

the tends to lean pro-choice but they

still do support the repeal of this
 
01:59:21.470 --> 01:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
restriction in law the U.S Supreme Court
 
01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
has already rejected the exact same
 
01:59:24.890 --> 01:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
language of this law
 
01:59:26.930 --> 01:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
in throwing out the Massachusetts law

the high court recognized both a free
 
01:59:31.970 --> 01:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
speech Zone and the impracticality of
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
blocking Free Press and competition

01:59:42.659 --> 01:59:43.609 align:start position:0%
by a competitor or a pamphleteer it is
argued

01:59:43.609 --> 01:59:43.619 align:start position:0%
argued
 
01:59:46.189 --> 01:59:46.199 align:start position:0%
by Governors Hassan and sununu in their
 
01:59:49.129 --> 01:59:49.139 align:start position:0%
veto messages that this law isn't never
 
01:59:51.290 --> 01:59:51.300 align:start position:0%
has been and never would be enforced
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
then why leave it on the books
 
01:59:55.970 --> 01:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
it is not our is it not our job as
 
01:59:57.950 --> 01:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
lawmakers to remove victimless crimes
 
02:00:00.589 --> 02:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
duplicate of laws unconstitutional and
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
vague statutes and laws that are never
 
02:00:04.609 --> 02:00:04.619 align:start position:0%
to be enforced is that not our primary
 
02:00:07.970 --> 02:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
Duty Mr Speaker God warns us in the
 
02:00:09.770 --> 02:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
Bible that man is not capable of making
 
02:00:12.290 --> 02:00:12.300 align:start position:0%
laws for his fellow man only God can do
 
02:00:14.330 --> 02:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
this because only God can foresee every
 
02:00:16.669 --> 02:00:16.679 align:start position:0%
possibility and every violation of the
 
02:00:18.169 --> 02:00:18.179 align:start position:0%
rights of man only God can understand
 
02:00:20.149 --> 02:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
every exception that could ever exist
 
02:00:22.729 --> 02:00:22.739 align:start position:0%
and every exceptional case that ever
 
02:00:25.010 --> 02:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
will exist
 
02:00:27.410 --> 02:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
since Pontius Pilate had Christ executed
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
man has continued to mechanically apply
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:35.689 --> 02:00:35.699 align:start position:0%
I asked for order in the in the chamber
 
02:00:40.189 --> 02:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:43.609 --> 02:00:43.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:46.010 --> 02:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
since Pontius Pilate had Christ executed
 
02:00:48.649 --> 02:00:48.659 align:start position:0%
man has continued to mechanically apply
 
02:00:51.530 --> 02:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
the law repeating the infamous excuse in
 
02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
other cases that we were just following
 
02:00:55.850 --> 02:00:55.860 align:start position:0%
orders men women and children have been
 
02:00:57.770 --> 02:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
enslaved dismembered hanged flayed
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
boiled and burned alive because laws
 
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
were enforced that were supposed to have
 
02:01:03.470 --> 02:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
been forgotten
 
02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
if it's not our job to repeal unenforced
 
02:01:08.570 --> 02:01:08.580 align:start position:0%
or unconstitutional laws then why are we
 
02:01:11.089 --> 02:01:11.099 align:start position:0%
here do we have any other purpose than
 
02:01:13.310 --> 02:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
to update the law itself
 
02:01:15.410 --> 02:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
why have separation of powers a system
 
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
of checks and balances
 
02:01:19.189 --> 02:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
if we will never act to limit the
 
02:01:21.109 --> 02:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
arbitrary power of the other two
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
branches of government
 
02:01:26.270 --> 02:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
our absolute constitutional mandate
 
02:01:28.669 --> 02:01:28.679 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker God was right man cannot
 
02:01:30.830 --> 02:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
predict the exceptional cases nor second
 
02:01:32.450 --> 02:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
guess the changing Logics of Court
 
02:01:34.430 --> 02:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
precedence we cannot foresee nor predict
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
what will happen in a thousand of cases
 
02:01:39.709 --> 02:01:39.719 align:start position:0%
and this is why we recognize the right
 
02:01:41.930 --> 02:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
of juries to nullify bad laws in badly
 
02:01:44.209 --> 02:01:44.219 align:start position:0%
interpreted laws
 
02:01:46.070 --> 02:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
yet in a greater sense it has been a
 
02:01:48.530 --> 02:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
dereliction of Duty for this body to
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
continue to leave this and many other
 
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
rsas in place after the courts have
 
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
thrown that language out for vagueness

but I am here to support

the governors
 
02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:36.589 align:start position:0%
the governors
fito

02:03:36.589 --> 02:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
fito
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's why the Earth is shaking
 
02:03:43.250 --> 02:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
and the since the governor vetoed this
 
02:03:43.260 --> 02:03:44.689 align:start position:0%
and the since the governor vetoed this
bill

02:03:44.689 --> 02:03:44.699 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:03:47.810 --> 02:03:47.820 align:start position:0%
16 States
 
02:03:51.709 --> 02:03:51.719 align:start position:0%
have have denied women
 
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
and their families and their doctors the
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
right for the women to control their own
 
02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:00.290 align:start position:0%
right for the women to control their own
bodies

02:04:00.290 --> 02:04:00.300 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
what has happened as a result of that is
 
02:04:07.609 --> 02:04:07.619 align:start position:0%
that in many other states
 
02:04:10.850 --> 02:04:10.860 align:start position:0%
the people who have been opposed to
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights are now looking
 
02:04:16.070 --> 02:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
around for something to do and they're
 
02:04:18.649 --> 02:04:18.659 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire
 
02:04:21.649 --> 02:04:21.659 align:start position:0%
so that increasingly those people who
 
02:04:25.010 --> 02:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
provide Health Care to women and in some
 
02:04:29.209 --> 02:04:29.219 align:start position:0%
cases to men have found an increase in
 
02:04:32.089 --> 02:04:32.099 align:start position:0%
the number of people
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
who have stood in front of their
 
02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:37.390 align:start position:0%
who have stood in front of their
facilities

02:04:37.390 --> 02:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:38.930 align:start position:0%
facilities
I

02:04:38.930 --> 02:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:04:41.450 --> 02:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
know there are lots of opinions I tend
 
02:04:45.310 --> 02:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
to like to stick with just the facts not
 
02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
suppositions not what other people might
 
02:04:51.370 --> 02:04:51.380 align:start position:0%
say not what a political party might say
 
02:04:54.410 --> 02:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
but the facts are
 
02:04:59.209 --> 02:04:59.219 align:start position:0%
that the language in in the buffer zone
 
02:05:02.229 --> 02:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
bill that law that exists has
 
02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
indefinitely not
 
02:05:08.930 --> 02:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
been overturned by any judicial body
 
02:05:13.729 --> 02:05:13.739 align:start position:0%
and it is an appropriate language to
 
02:05:16.550 --> 02:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
help make it possible to protect Public
 
02:05:21.729 --> 02:05:21.739 align:start position:0%
Safety and I ask you on that basis alone
 
02:05:25.250 --> 02:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
to support the governors of Ito thank
 
02:05:28.070 --> 02:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I rise in opposition to the
 
02:05:44.570 --> 02:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
governor's veto
 
02:05:48.290 --> 02:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
I do so not because as the esteemed
 
02:05:51.470 --> 02:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
representative from Durham said that our
 
02:05:53.229 --> 02:05:53.239 align:start position:0%
buffer of Zone law has been found
 
02:05:56.030 --> 02:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional I do so because it
 
02:05:57.649 --> 02:05:57.659 align:start position:0%
likely will
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
and like we will simply because it
 
02:06:04.370 --> 02:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
violates a higher pretty hard and fast
 
02:06:06.430 --> 02:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
02:06:09.189 --> 02:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
precedence about
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
curtailment of speech based on Viewpoint
 
02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:13.430 align:start position:0%
curtailment of speech based on Viewpoint
discrimination

02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
02:06:16.609 --> 02:06:16.619 align:start position:0%
and since our law
 
02:06:20.570 --> 02:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
is explicitly Viewpoint discrimination I
 
02:06:22.609 --> 02:06:22.619 align:start position:0%
don't believe it will be upheld
 
02:06:25.970 --> 02:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
so that's one reason why I oppose it
 
02:06:29.930 --> 02:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
the bigger is you know just as well
 
02:06:33.530 --> 02:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
is because it isn't it intends
 
02:06:35.930 --> 02:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
to restrict that freedom of expression
 
02:06:39.410 --> 02:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
that we find so important in our country
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's its intent
 
02:06:43.970 --> 02:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
and as such I couldn't cotton it either
 
02:06:43.980 --> 02:06:45.530 align:start position:0%
and as such I couldn't cotton it either
way

02:06:45.530 --> 02:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:06:47.870 --> 02:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
but on the in addition to that
 
02:06:51.410 --> 02:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
the law is totally unnecessary it was
 
02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessary the day it was drafted it
 
02:06:55.970 --> 02:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
was unnecessary the day it was passed
 
02:06:58.189 --> 02:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
it's been unnecessary for the whole time
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's been on the books and as near as I
 
02:07:02.589 --> 02:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
can tell it will continue to be totally
 
02:07:07.089 --> 02:07:07.099 align:start position:0%
unnecessary there has never been a case
 
02:07:09.530 --> 02:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
where this buffer zone would have
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
stopped any infringement of the law
 
02:07:14.570 --> 02:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
never in the history of the state of New
 
02:07:17.629 --> 02:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has there ever been a single
 
02:07:17.639 --> 02:07:18.890 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has there ever been a single
case

02:07:18.890 --> 02:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:07:21.890 --> 02:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
year after year as we have discussed
 
02:07:25.310 --> 02:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
this bill from the day it came in until
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
today has there even been complaints
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
to the police
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
it does not happen
 
02:07:35.950 --> 02:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
because the people that are out there
 
02:07:40.330 --> 02:07:40.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:44.510 --> 02:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
for the saving of babies lives
 
02:07:49.729 --> 02:07:49.739 align:start position:0%
do so out of a spirit a spirit of love
 
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
not of hate
 
02:07:55.010 --> 02:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
so Mr Speaker there was unnecessary it's
 
02:07:57.770 --> 02:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
likely unconstitutional I urge you to
 
02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:03.719 align:start position:0%

02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
the rules be suspended to reintroduce
 
02:11:36.649 --> 02:11:36.659 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry
 
02:11:39.530 --> 02:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
asking the In This Very exceptional uh
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
circumstance that the rules be suspended
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
for the reintroduction of a bill that
 
02:11:46.370 --> 02:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
this house has passed unanimously three
 
02:11:48.189 --> 02:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
times before and the Senate has passed
 
02:11:50.330 --> 02:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
unanimously that the Senate Judiciary
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
Committee and the house criminal justice
 
02:11:54.790 --> 02:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
committee have passed unanimously
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
this is House Bill 1067 was was just
 
02:12:01.609 --> 02:12:01.619 align:start position:0%
dealing with the problem that we brought
 
02:12:01.619 --> 02:12:02.629 align:start position:0%
dealing with the problem that we brought
up

02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:12:05.270 --> 02:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
that if a child is the victim of felony
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
assault many of the attackers have been
 
02:12:10.430 --> 02:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
getting away I'll remember I remind a
 
02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
member this is on suspension of the
 
02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
rules not the bill itself
 
02:12:17.149 --> 02:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
just reminding members of the content of
 
02:12:19.669 --> 02:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
the bill if that's all right why you
 
02:12:21.709 --> 02:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
need to suspend the rules is what this
 
02:12:24.109 --> 02:12:24.119 align:start position:0%
is about not the bill itself the content
 
02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:30.530 --> 02:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
the reason for the need to suspend the
 
02:12:33.890 --> 02:12:33.900 align:start position:0%
rules is that hundreds of children are
 
02:12:36.350 --> 02:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
injured every month that children in New
 
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are killed every year
 
02:12:42.649 --> 02:12:42.659 align:start position:0%
that this has been an ongoing crisis I
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any question that
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
the protection of children is something
 
02:12:50.149 --> 02:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
that we have uh bent the rules in the
 
02:12:51.709 --> 02:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
past for if we needed to when children
 
02:12:54.649 --> 02:12:54.659 align:start position:0%
safety uh took precedence when I ran for
 
02:12:56.750 --> 02:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
office the first time I I told my
 
02:12:57.950 --> 02:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
constituents I would put children's
 
02:13:01.310 --> 02:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:03.229 --> 02:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
reason that I initially introduced the
 
02:13:03.239 --> 02:13:04.189 align:start position:0%
reason that I initially introduced the
bill

02:13:04.189 --> 02:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:13:06.169 --> 02:13:06.179 align:start position:0%
was because of a case where someone was
 
02:13:10.370 --> 02:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
putting out cigarettes on uh
 
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
a four-year-old child's arm okay once
 
02:13:15.410 --> 02:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
again I'll remind the member this is not
 
02:13:17.209 --> 02:13:17.219 align:start position:0%
about the content of the bill this is
 
02:13:19.850 --> 02:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
why you need to suspend the rules
 
02:13:23.169 --> 02:13:23.179 align:start position:0%
uh can I ask for a clarification why why
 
02:13:26.209 --> 02:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
is it timely or any of that nature not
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.550 align:start position:0%
 
Mike

02:13:31.550 --> 02:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
Mike
 
02:13:33.709 --> 02:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
my question is the urgency is driven by
 
02:13:33.719 --> 02:13:35.209 align:start position:0%
my question is the urgency is driven by
the

02:13:35.209 --> 02:13:35.219 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:13:37.250 --> 02:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
speak to speak to the members not to me
 
02:13:39.950 --> 02:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
well I'm asking for a clarification for
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
how I'm being written restricted the
 
02:13:43.790 --> 02:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
reason for doing this is for the
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
protecting the public safety of children
 
02:13:47.689 --> 02:13:47.699 align:start position:0%
which is many members will vote to
 
02:13:49.790 --> 02:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
suspend the rules only for children's
 
02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
safety or only for an immediate
 
02:13:51.599 --> 02:13:53.330 align:start position:0%
safety or only for an immediate
emergency

02:13:53.330 --> 02:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
I'm asking for additional distance
 
02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
that's fine but we don't need to get
 
02:13:58.430 --> 02:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
into about cigarettes and all that kind
 
02:14:04.189 --> 02:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
so just the process the first time the
 
02:14:10.430 --> 02:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
house passed this uh unanimously it did
 
02:14:12.290 --> 02:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
go to the Senate and the Senate because
 
02:14:15.050 --> 02:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
of the coronavirus because of the
 
02:14:17.930 --> 02:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
lockdown that bill and many others other
 
02:14:20.089 --> 02:14:20.099 align:start position:0%
members bills were killed
 
02:14:21.890 --> 02:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
the second time putting the bill through
 
02:14:24.169 --> 02:14:24.179 align:start position:0%
it went through the Senate unanimously
 
02:14:26.450 --> 02:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
but it was vetoed by the governor
 
02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:30.810 align:start position:0%
without a very clear reason I think I
 
02:14:30.810 --> 02:14:32.149 align:start position:0%
without a very clear reason I think I
[Music]

02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:14:34.970 --> 02:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
the third time the house passed this
 
02:14:37.069 --> 02:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
bill again unanimously
 
02:14:37.079 --> 02:14:38.149 align:start position:0%
bill again unanimously
and

02:14:38.149 --> 02:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
send it over to the Senate and I
 
02:14:43.609 --> 02:14:43.619 align:start position:0%
was noticed about the hearing only after
 
02:14:44.930 --> 02:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
the hearing had occurred it was
 
02:14:46.910 --> 02:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
literally hours after the hearing had
 
02:14:49.910 --> 02:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
occurred and the Senate killed the bill
 
02:14:52.910 --> 02:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
for that reason I lost my primary on
 
02:14:54.290 --> 02:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
Tuesday so I won't have the ability to
 
02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
reintroduce the bill but even if if a
 
02:14:58.430 --> 02:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
member were
 
02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
this issue will continue on more and
 
02:15:03.189 --> 02:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
more children will be injured
 
02:15:05.689 --> 02:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
and the deterring effect of the law is
 
02:15:08.209 --> 02:15:08.219 align:start position:0%
lost unless we vote to suspend the rules
 
02:15:10.970 --> 02:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
and allow this essentially one sentence
 
02:15:12.950 --> 02:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
to be reintroduced
 
02:15:15.530 --> 02:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
uh to the house and go go to the Senate
 
02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
and hopefully be signed into law in
 
02:15:21.169 --> 02:15:21.179 align:start position:0%
response to the governor's concerns
 
02:15:23.330 --> 02:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
I'm asking members to wave
 
02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
normal traditions and suspend the rules
 
02:15:28.850 --> 02:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
and press the green button
 
02:15:30.770 --> 02:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
chair recognize representative Timothy
 
02:15:30.780 --> 02:15:33.410 align:start position:0%
chair recognize representative Timothy
Smith

02:15:33.410 --> 02:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:35.870 --> 02:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
everything we do in this chamber is
 
02:15:41.390 --> 02:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
important all of the legislation that
 
02:15:43.729 --> 02:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
gets filed is important at least to
 
02:15:43.739 --> 02:15:45.229 align:start position:0%
gets filed is important at least to
somebody

02:15:45.229 --> 02:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
02:15:47.209 --> 02:15:47.219 align:start position:0%
all of the bills that we get from the
 
02:15:50.030 --> 02:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
other chamber are important and we have
 
02:15:52.450 --> 02:15:52.460 align:start position:0%
a process that we go through
 
02:15:55.129 --> 02:15:55.139 align:start position:0%
to handle all of these important issues
 
02:15:56.689 --> 02:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
that we deal with
 
02:15:58.370 --> 02:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
we typically
 
02:16:00.290 --> 02:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
at least in the 10 years I've been here
 
02:16:04.490 --> 02:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
only make exceptions to that in severe
 
02:16:08.510 --> 02:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances of imminent emergency
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
national disasters and things of that
 
02:16:13.490 --> 02:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
nature there's some huge flood we got to
 
02:16:15.589 --> 02:16:15.599 align:start position:0%
clean it up there's a huge ice storm in
 
02:16:16.910 --> 02:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
the whole State's Frozen and the power
 
02:16:18.530 --> 02:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
lines have fallen down we got to do
 
02:16:20.569 --> 02:16:20.579 align:start position:0%
something about it we get called back by
 
02:16:21.890 --> 02:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
02:16:25.790 --> 02:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
to take action in response to some you
 
02:16:27.229 --> 02:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
know uh Court decision like what
 
02:16:28.430 --> 02:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
happened a few years ago with the
 
02:16:31.010 --> 02:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
Wayfair thing we suspend the rules in
 
02:16:32.629 --> 02:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
order to circumvent our normal
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
legislative calendar in order to handle
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
those immediate time-sensitive issues we
 
02:16:42.469 --> 02:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
only do that very sparingly when there
 
02:16:44.290 --> 02:16:44.300 align:start position:0%
is an immediate
 
02:16:47.209 --> 02:16:47.219 align:start position:0%
time-sensitive issue that cannot be
 
02:16:49.009 --> 02:16:49.019 align:start position:0%
resolved within the normal legislative
 
02:16:49.019 --> 02:16:50.330 align:start position:0%
resolved within the normal legislative
calendar

02:16:50.330 --> 02:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
02:16:53.209 --> 02:16:53.219 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that the supporters of the
 
02:16:55.009 --> 02:16:55.019 align:start position:0%
underlying legislation here feel that
 
02:16:56.570 --> 02:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
it's extremely important and I'm sure it
 
02:16:59.330 --> 02:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
is important because every every Bill we
 
02:17:01.549 --> 02:17:01.559 align:start position:0%
get pass or fail is important
 
02:17:03.290 --> 02:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
legislation because the work we do here
 
02:17:06.410 --> 02:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
matters however it does not rise to the
 
02:17:09.290 --> 02:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
level of a natural disaster some
 
02:17:12.889 --> 02:17:12.899 align:start position:0%
imminent National catastrophe a viral
 
02:17:15.530 --> 02:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
pandemic or something if not that nature
 
02:17:18.349 --> 02:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
that simply cannot wait for the regular
 
02:17:20.570 --> 02:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
legislative calendar to take its process
 
02:17:23.389 --> 02:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
next term I would urge everyone to vote
 
02:17:26.690 --> 02:17:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:26.700 --> 02:17:31.450 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:17:31.450 --> 02:17:31.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
has requested a roll call is that
 
02:17:39.410 --> 02:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:45.010 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:45.010 --> 02:17:58.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:17:58.070 --> 02:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:50.389 align:start position:0%
 
ah

02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:52.790 --> 02:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is to suspend the
 
02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:56.750 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is to suspend the
rules

02:18:56.750 --> 02:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:58.429 --> 02:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
02:19:03.410 --> 02:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that suspending the
 
02:19:08.509 --> 02:19:08.519 align:start position:0%
rules to circumvent the normal
 
02:19:11.690 --> 02:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
legislative calendar in a situation like
 
02:19:14.450 --> 02:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
this should only be done in response to

02:37:03.889 --> 02:37:03.899 align:start position:0%
given them opportunity and I told them
 
02:37:07.070 --> 02:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
just like I did the Democrat Party and
 
02:37:08.929 --> 02:37:08.939 align:start position:0%
the Republican party did not send us
 
02:37:12.230 --> 02:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
here your constituents did you vote by
 
02:37:13.969 --> 02:37:13.979 align:start position:0%
your heart and if you believe in
 
02:37:15.530 --> 02:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
something you stand by it and I told

them all on both parties that in my
 
02:37:19.790 --> 02:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
committee that's why we had such a great
 
02:37:23.090 --> 02:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
time working hand in hand together I
 
02:37:25.490 --> 02:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
hope and I've been in this business for
 
02:37:26.990 --> 02:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
many years so you don't know I was a
 
02:37:29.450 --> 02:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
Democrat for many years okay my
 
02:37:32.330 --> 02:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
grandfather was a fortune mayor I grew
 
02:37:33.530 --> 02:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
up sitting at the table with the
 
02:37:36.290 --> 02:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
Kennedys grew up with chip O'Neill okay
 
02:37:38.990 --> 02:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
my grandfather was Al valucci 50 years
 
02:37:41.150 --> 02:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
politics but what I'm trying to say is
 
02:37:44.210 --> 02:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
back then we all we might disagree but
 
02:37:46.910 --> 02:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
we worked hand in hand together eighty
 
02:37:48.410 --> 02:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
percent of the legislation in this house
 
02:37:50.210 --> 02:37:50.220 align:start position:0%
we all come together
 
02:37:51.710 --> 02:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
but yet some attack each other
 
02:37:54.530 --> 02:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
personally or they want to throw stones
 
02:37:56.030 --> 02:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
at you and call you everything in the
 
02:37:57.950 --> 02:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
book and that's me I've been called
 
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
everything in the book okay I've been
 
02:38:03.230 --> 02:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
attacked over and over and over and for
 
02:38:04.790 --> 02:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
no reason because you really didn't know
 
02:38:07.130 --> 02:38:07.140 align:start position:0%
me because you looked at me and said wow
 
02:38:10.370 --> 02:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
he's an ass okay but really I'm an old
 
02:38:12.410 --> 02:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
marine and Marine Corps mentality take
 
02:38:14.750 --> 02:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
the hill but make sure you teach the
 
02:38:16.969 --> 02:38:16.979 align:start position:0%
team everyone else so they survive and
 
02:38:18.650 --> 02:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
that's what we did up here we came
 
02:38:21.050 --> 02:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
together in many many issues and I'm
 
02:38:23.270 --> 02:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
hoping the future we come back together
 
02:38:25.010 --> 02:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
the way it was
 
02:38:25.020 --> 02:38:26.280 align:start position:0%

hand in hand if you noticed many times
 
02:38:47.630 --> 02:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
when I was the floor leader I got up
 
02:38:49.250 --> 02:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
because I recognized his voice being
 
02:38:52.490 --> 02:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
weak he was in the Army so I understand

with us for four years but we have an
 
02:44:18.530 --> 02:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity to help the work she will be
 
02:44:18.540 --> 02:44:20.450 align:start position:0%
opportunity to help the work she will be
doing

um
 
02:44:25.309 --> 02:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
because my colleague from the other side
 
02:44:26.870 --> 02:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
of Loudon Road
 
02:44:29.090 --> 02:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
uh made history
 
02:44:31.610 --> 02:44:31.620 align:start position:0%

02:44:33.170 --> 02:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
people I know
 
02:44:35.389 --> 02:44:35.399 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to share this good news
 
02:44:37.790 --> 02:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
about the work she'll be doing
 
02:44:40.250 --> 02:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
when she was elected after a heated and
 
02:44:43.010 --> 02:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
sometimes ugly campaign her Victory made
 
02:44:45.469 --> 02:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
it into the New York Times and all kinds
 
02:44:47.809 --> 02:44:47.819 align:start position:0%

international news
 
02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:52.560 align:start position:0%

native country of Afghanistan
 
02:44:58.010 --> 02:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
where she and her family had to flee
 
02:45:01.309 --> 02:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
because her father a patriot to the
 
02:45:04.550 --> 02:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
United States served and assisted our
 
02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:08.809 align:start position:0%
United States served and assisted our
military

02:45:08.809 --> 02:45:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:11.270 --> 02:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
um he was an interpreter they became
 
02:45:14.150 --> 02:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
targeted by the enemies and after stays
 
02:45:17.030 --> 02:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
in multiple refugee camps her family
 
02:45:20.150 --> 02:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
made it to Concord she graduated from
 
02:45:22.070 --> 02:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
Concord High School
 
02:45:25.910 --> 02:45:25.920 align:start position:0%

02:45:29.850 --> 02:45:29.860 align:start position:0%
you're 30 yet
 
02:45:29.860 --> 02:45:32.870 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:45:38.690 --> 02:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
I'm editing a few things here sorry
 
02:45:41.990 --> 02:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
she still would like to be with us but
 
02:45:45.469 --> 02:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
what she's doing instead out of the out
 
02:45:47.809 --> 02:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
of just makes sense that she'd be the
 
02:45:50.570 --> 02:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
person to do this and what inspired me
 
02:45:52.790 --> 02:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
were the speeches that a few folks and
 
02:45:55.670 --> 02:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
especially my colleague from Londonderry
 
02:45:58.309 --> 02:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
as the daughter of a marine Semper
 
02:45:58.319 --> 02:46:00.889 align:start position:0%
as the daughter of a marine Semper
Fidelis

02:46:04.849 --> 02:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
ly about Afghanistan and how our
 
02:46:07.670 --> 02:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from Afghanistan
 
02:46:07.680 --> 02:46:09.190 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from Afghanistan
was

02:46:09.190 --> 02:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
parched and what is difficult is that
 
02:46:17.290 --> 02:46:17.300 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a plan necessarily to help
 
02:46:20.389 --> 02:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
those families and those Patriots who
 
02:46:22.070 --> 02:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
helped our country
 
02:46:26.570 --> 02:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
but now more and more of them are being
 
02:46:26.580 --> 02:46:27.710 align:start position:0%
but now more and more of them are being
um

02:46:27.710 --> 02:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:32.389 --> 02:46:32.399 align:start position:0%

02:47:08.510 --> 02:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
need is housing well obviously the
 
02:47:11.450 --> 02:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
housing is a big issue here so if anyone
 
02:47:15.830 --> 02:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
has any connection to fair housing or
 
02:47:18.230 --> 02:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
assisting connections with landlords
 
02:47:21.410 --> 02:47:21.420 align:start position:0%

02:47:24.530 --> 02:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units or any thoughts
 
02:47:26.570 --> 02:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
if you're a member of a church or a
 
02:47:28.490 --> 02:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
temple or other congregation that would
 
02:47:30.590 --> 02:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
like to help that's their number one
 
02:47:32.630 --> 02:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
need I mean
 
02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:33.410 align:start position:0%
need I mean
um

02:47:33.410 --> 02:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:35.450 --> 02:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
some have been here for six or more
 
02:47:39.349 --> 02:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
months and they have no home yet
 
02:47:42.349 --> 02:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
they also need volunteers people to help
 
02:47:45.190 --> 02:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
teach English and for another
 
02:47:49.429 --> 02:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
colleague from Loudon uh
 
02:47:51.170 --> 02:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
they need people to help teach the
 
02:47:53.929 --> 02:47:53.939 align:start position:0%
citizenship test as they are on the path
 
02:47:55.730 --> 02:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
to citizenship
 
02:47:58.130 --> 02:47:58.140 align:start position:0%
I test most of us couldn't pass by the
 
02:47:58.140 --> 02:48:00.530 align:start position:0%
I test most of us couldn't pass by the
way

02:48:00.530 --> 02:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:03.170 --> 02:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
um and they also need donations so I
 
02:48:06.349 --> 02:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
just wanted you to know that we talk
 
02:48:09.170 --> 02:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
about people who serve our country we
 
02:48:12.110 --> 02:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
obviously as legislators serve our state
 
02:48:15.230 --> 02:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
many of you served our country many of
 
02:48:17.090 --> 02:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
you related to people who served our
 
02:48:20.210 --> 02:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
country but don't forget that our new
 
02:48:23.510 --> 02:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
Americans include people like Sophia and
 
02:48:26.750 --> 02:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
her family who fled countries where
 
02:48:30.110 --> 02:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
where because they assisted our country
 
02:48:33.290 --> 02:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
they now are new Americans and I hope
 
02:48:35.450 --> 02:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
that if you have the opportunity to be
 
02:48:38.030 --> 02:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
helpful that you will find a way to be
 
02:48:40.670 --> 02:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
helpful and that's not as much as a
 
02:48:43.010 --> 02:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
recognition but a thank you for the work
 
02:48:45.050 --> 02:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
