there also a Amendment for us today that
 
00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 align:start position:0%
we'll be discussing as well we'll get to
 
00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
that course anyone have any thoughts
 
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
let's see where we stand on
 
00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
this um representative Le temporary
 
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
health partner one um I'm okay with that
 
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
it's we actually discussed this some as
 
00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
part of uh think there was an item in
 
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
133 that was related to this but
 
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.229 align:start position:0%
133 that was related to this but
um

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
it it just seems it's it's a i it was
 
00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 align:start position:0%
permitted under the state of emergency
 
00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
and I think the idea is to let people
 
00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
get a foot in the door with minimal
 
00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439 align:start position:0%
training and get further training both
 
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
on the job and then they're still going
 
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
to be required to uh to do the
 
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.309 align:start position:0%
to be required to uh to do the
continuing

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
continuing
 
00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
education and you know and then they can
 
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
proceed if they want to actually become
 
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 align:start position:0%
lnas in which case they'll have to meet
 
00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
all the LNA requirements but at least
 
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
Tes heard is that it will get them in
 
00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
the door see they could decide if that's
 
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
something they wanted to do and will
 
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
also provide U so much need of
 
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
assistance for nurses and L which we
 
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
have an incredible shortage of right
 
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
Gera thank you Mr
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
chair state of emergencies are enacted
 
00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 align:start position:0%
be I mean executive orders during state
 
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
of emergencies are enacted because of
 
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
certain situation in this case it was
 
00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 align:start position:0%
the need for healthcare workers due to
 
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
the covid pandemic and the increase in
 
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations um for those PE for
 
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
people who had contracted that virus I
 
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
don't believe that things like this that
 
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
are um put under um executive order in
 
00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 align:start position:0%
in an emergency are warranted to
 
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 align:start position:0%
continue I don't uh support excuse me
 
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
reducing the requirements for this
 
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 align:start position:0%
position based permanently based
 
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
on the uh the the current
 
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
situation um I believe that people who
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
are lnas are should have the
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
qualifications to start um
 
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
and I don't support
 
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
155 um representa pearon thank you Mr
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
chairman um the committee of which I'm
 
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
the chairman which is Health Human
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
Services and elderly Affairs um
 
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
committee is comprised mostly of doctors
 
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
and psychologists and therapists and
 
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
medical administrators and so on uh no
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
surprise there and we've looked at the
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
idea of various power
 
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
P Personnel not just in emergencies but
 
00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
going forward we're trying to figure out
 
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
what we can do to to help the undeserved
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
areas not just the Northland but other
 
00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 align:start position:0%
places as well and while we are very uh
 
00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
convinced that people need to be trained
 
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
and supervised all up and down the
 
00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
various you know ladders of professional
 
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
jobs we also see there is a place not
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
just in an emergency but at other times
 
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
for such um well we're calling them
 
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
emergency workers now but going forward
 
00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759 align:start position:0%
they might not be but people who can
 
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
come in be specifically trained to a
 
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
task or two be supervised and as a
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
previous speaker said decide whether
 
00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 align:start position:0%
this is for them or not so uh just
 
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
coming as an outsider from another
 
00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
committee uh this is the kind of thing
 
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
that we've looked upon with some
 
00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:54.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 align:start position:0%

my predecessors have said this morning
 
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 align:start position:0%

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
take care of things like toileting
 
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
themselves and feeding themselves so
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
forth in a reliable fashion um to the
 
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
degree that the lnas are not there to do
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
this vital uh crucial work uh it's going
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
to have to be done by somebody else uh
 
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
and if that person is a an RN uh who
 
00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
would likely be the next person uh in
 
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
line then that takes them away from
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
medical functions which which they can
 
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
perform but lnas cannnot uh so in
 
00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
addition to what representative Lea said
 
00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
it's not merely a question of getting
 
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
these people in the door many of them
 
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
are already in the door uh Statewide
 
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
anyway uh performing these functions um
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
and and as I say these are crucial vital
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
functions that have to be done uh in
 
00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
order for the for the uh the patients at
 
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
nursing homes to be adequately cared for
 
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
care is the the underlying word here um
 
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.909 align:start position:0%
care is the the underlying word here um
and

00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
the uh medical care but U physical care
 
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
that they need so I'm very much in
 
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
support of uh this then I certainly will
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
vote for it in the committee when it
 
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:51.550 align:start position:0%
vote for it in the committee when it
comes

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
time Mr Cher muff are you calling me I
 
00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:56.519 align:start position:0%
was call Representative Schultz I she
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
had hand we couldn't hear you sorry yeah
 
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
sorry mumbled a little bit yeah we're
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
having a hard time hearing you this
 
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chair for whatever reason um
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
I just have a few questions
 
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
um I saw my mother-in-law become an LNA
 
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
training that she went through was kind
 
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
of interesting it was sponsored by the
 
00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
Red Cross it you know the sort of
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
training that elen go through typically
 
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:29.240 align:start position:0%
isn't while it can be through
 
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
traditional um you know like community
 
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
colleges and
 
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
whatnot it isn't that at least what she
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
went through the traditional type of um
 
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.949 align:start position:0%
went through the traditional type of um
higher

00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
higher
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
education that I had assumed it would be
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
which I found interesting I'm curious to
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
know then with this
 
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
designation of someone who's in
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
training what is the pay
 
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
differential and is there any sort of uh
 
00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
tuition or fee
 
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
for let's see if we have anyone who can
 
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
answer that question if anyone is in the
 
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
jumping and I'll just then if no one can
 
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
answer the question you know one of the
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
things that I did like about the
 
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
training that she went through is you
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
know as an incentive to get folks into
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
those training classes there was a
 
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
guarantee that any tuition being paid
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
would be um that debt would be cleared
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
once someone had served in a certain job
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
by six months or whatever I actually um
 
00:10:57.389 --> 00:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
thought that whole scheme was kind of
 
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
ridiculous so I'm very open to this uh
 
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
change if especially since there's such
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
a desperate need for the um for folks to
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
perform these jobs and I can't see why
 
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
um so long as the important parts of the
 
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
training curriculum are met and included
 
00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:21.079 align:start position:0%
in some way shape or fashion this might
 
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
actually be better for the folks going
 
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
into this field they wouldn't have to
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
incur any debt at the um outet but I am
 
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
also still concerned then to know if
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
there is any traditional pay um or if
 
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
it's some sort of a training rate I'm
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
concerned about pay and
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
tuition um this might be a great way to
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
get around student loan debt for this
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
type of position and I like that but um
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
having the answer to that would be very
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
important and if there's a pay uh a
 
00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:00.519 align:start position:0%
graded scale of pay for people who are
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
in training versus lnas themselves if
 
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
someone can answer
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
that thank you I don't see anything in
 
00:12:11.069 --> 00:12:11.079 align:start position:0%
the statute prer pay level so I guess
 
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
that would be up to the employer we'll
 
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
keep an eye out for anyone who they can
 
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.890 align:start position:0%
keep an eye out for anyone who they can
answer

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:17.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.269 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:21.230 align:start position:0%
[Music]
that

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
yeah as I recall question that I we were
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
hearing Rel
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
133 and
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
especially for the nursing homes and it
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
is I'm sorry Mr chair I'm and I
 
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
representative like I'm so sorry to
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
interrupt you I'm just having a horrible
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
time hearing you there in the committee
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
room the sound is different than it
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
normally is and we want to hear you is
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
this any
 
00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
better no it's it sounds
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
muffled I've got a microphone here I
 
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
but maybe we need someone
 
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
from the staff to help I don't know if
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
it's that that's what they do but it's
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
definitely not as good as it normally is
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
I can contact it to um see if he can
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
help out at all yeah if you don't mind I
 
00:13:23.949 --> 00:13:23.959 align:start position:0%
appreciate that is this any better I'm
 
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
trying a different
 
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.269 align:start position:0%
trying a different
microphone

00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
thought okay in the meantime while we're
 
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
trying to get our technical difficulty
 
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.670 align:start position:0%
trying to get our technical difficulty
without

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
much I I believe you just called on me
 
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.949 align:start position:0%
much I I believe you just called on me
Mr

00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:49.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
chair um now you're
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
muffled yes he did it was you
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
representative shuy called on thank you
 
00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.430 align:start position:0%
representative shuy called on thank you
um

00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure this may be a question for
 
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
um representative Pearson since he is
 
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
here from Health and Human
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
Services um since we know that even lnas
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
are technically paid less than what one
 
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
would hope to do the work that they do
 
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
and these temporary health workers I
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
understand are paid even less than lnas
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
are uh this committee did not hear any
 
00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
great outpouring from folks doing this
 
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.160 align:start position:0%
kind of work with interest into this
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
program I was wondering if Health and
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
Human Services heard from many folks who
 
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
would be interested in taking advantage
 
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.829 align:start position:0%
would be interested in taking advantage
of

00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:46.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
this uh thank you representative Shu and
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
on the sliding down pay scale
 
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
legislators are paid even
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
less um uh we heard from a few we didn't
 
00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:03.079 align:start position:0%
hear from a lot uh we heard from other
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
legislators who have been contacted by
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
people who are interested my County job
 
00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
is to be one who looks over our County
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
nursing home and from that direct
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
supervision I can tell you we could use
 
00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of people at various levels and
 
00:15:23.749 --> 00:15:23.759 align:start position:0%
because we cannot get the kind of people
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
that we might normally want in a
 
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
particular slot we found this idea
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
to be very helpful and very creative but
 
00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
more directly to your one of your
 
00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
questions uh we really didn't discuss
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
specifically pay um I know in the
 
00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
medical facility that I am CEO of is one
 
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
of my day jobs uh we bring in people on
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
a training wage and if they look pretty
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
good we uh give them a regular job and
 
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
bump up their pay accordingly and make
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
up for some of the shortfall during
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
their training period I think this would
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
probably be up to the facility in
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you I'm being chair of my
 
00:16:09.949 --> 00:16:09.959 align:start position:0%
County delegation I'm aware of what
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
happened at our Marram County Nursing
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
house but again like I said I know this
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
being lesser pay and the incentive pay
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
from a public nursing home is not as
 
00:16:30.309 --> 00:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
easily made up perhaps as at a private
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
answer a single p in months I
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair and I uh too I
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
don't think would support this section
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
of uh the bill um you look at what we've
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
has created a position for the pandemic
 
00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
a temporary health
 
00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
partner and this was to address Staffing
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
shortages at long-term facilities to
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
meet the
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
needs um read on further it goes on to
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
say it's a temporary position um and
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
temporary is not defined here are these
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
going to be temporary full-time
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
positions or truly temporary positions
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
um well I understand the need for lnas
 
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.190 align:start position:0%
um well I understand the need for lnas
um

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
and understand the issues they're having
 
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
and bringing in lnas I think the problem
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
uh with that
 
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.200 align:start position:0%
is pay not that there's not enough
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
qualified candidates out there I think I
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
think we're looking at uh the pay
 
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
structure going forward and to bring in
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
a temporary health partner at a lower
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
scale than an LNA I don't think is going
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
to work um scope will work a temporary
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
health partner thp is a temporary
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
position this is directly from the bill
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
limited to assist lnas no definition of
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
temporary and that's what I have an
 
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.029 align:start position:0%
temporary and that's what I have an
issue

00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
with this is supposed to be temporary to
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
address a an emergency situation which
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
we're in um this I don't think was meant
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
longterm um and the only question other
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
question I have and I don't remember if
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
this was brought forward in the public
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
hearing or not um for the County nursing
 
00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:21.559 align:start position:0%
homes or any of the nursing homes out
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
there is this reimbursable through um
 
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.909 align:start position:0%
there is this reimbursable through um
Medicare

00:18:26.909 --> 00:18:26.919 align:start position:0%
Medicare
 
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid because if not it's going to be
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
an added expense to these
 
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
facilities think that was touched on at
 
00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.350 align:start position:0%
facilities think that was touched on at
133

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
133
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
that um yeah 133 we got
 
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
the as well for these and um as I recall
 
00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
they said it was reimbursed by Medicare
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and that actually
 
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
limited um you know how much could be
 
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
paid other
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
question question for representative
 
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
Pearson and that is um do we have any
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
idea how many of these uh people Health
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
Partners actually were
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
employed during the pandemic was not
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
bring up it I don't I mean maybe there
 
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
was a surge in you during the pandemic
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is it's been a
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
serious problem for quite a while and
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's not going to end with the pandemic
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
so I'm Wonder watch this the uh people
 
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
question sorry you're I'm sorry Mr chair
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
you're um audio is going in and out
 
00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:51.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
me asked
 
00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
question just so you know I have
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
contacted it and and um I'm not sure
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
exactly where he is in the building but
 
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
Ryan um dorington is on the way so he's
 
00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:11.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.799 --> 00:20:17.470 align:start position:0%
 
problem

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
okay to expanded definitely
 
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.909 align:start position:0%
okay to expanded definitely
have

00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
education yes did you did you call my
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
name probably need to
 
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
oh it's really not
 
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
microphone is there a I'm
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
sorry there was a game adustment on the
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
microphone and
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
represent looking at it doing little do
 
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.470 align:start position:0%
represent looking at it doing little do
some

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
self-help okay for what it's worth since
 
00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:54.919 align:start position:0%
I mostly understood what you just said
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
um it does sound like uh from our
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
if the output of your microphone is too
 
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
high like it's it's too reverberating
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
from noise on our side that does muffle
 
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
what you say so if you have the ability
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
to control the volume of the output of
 
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
your mic if that makes sense to what we
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
hear if you I think if you lower it a
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
little bit it that's what the Distortion
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
sounds like like it's too
 
00:21:33.149 --> 00:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
how about for me on this mic that I'm on
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
better so representative peon can hear
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
me question if you didn't hear it was uh
 
00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:50.919 align:start position:0%
first of all you know is this an ongoing
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
issue that's not specific the
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
pandemic second is how many of these
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
temporary health par were hired uh
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
during the uh while the emergency order
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
is I I think I heard my name if that's
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
true I'll continue if not just somebody
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
waved me off your name
 
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.669 align:start position:0%
waved me off your name
sorry

00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
um we have a need for such people in my
 
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
opinion both during an emergency and
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
ongoing because prior to the pandemic uh
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County nursing home was still
 
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
at wit's end needing people at all
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
levels but a temporary level below our
 
00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:42.919 align:start position:0%
normal low level was considered a a good
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
thing to have again people may decide
 
00:22:47.549 --> 00:22:47.559 align:start position:0%
they like it and then go back and get a
 
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
certificate or even a degree uh or they
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
may decide they don't like it and and
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
seek employment elsewhere but it is like
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
a temp job in in you know in high school
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh it is temp but um for some people
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
that turned into something regular um I
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
I see the need straight across the board
 
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
when the pandemic lifts and when it
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't of course we have the question
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
of the bill before us which addresses
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
temporary I can follow yes so um I the
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
question was raised and I have it as
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
well um what makes this temporary I mean
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
it and does that should that term
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
actually be in the bill
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
um I you know we might hope that such
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
people would move up to
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
LNA but is that actually a requirements
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
and if so what's the definition of
 
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
temporary in this context well I'm doing
 
00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
something I told my committee to do and
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's read the bill it's very
 
00:23:48.269 --> 00:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
informative um I don't see a definition
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
I would want one
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
yeah um I can interrupt I just want to
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
test does this microphone sound better
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
and is this one working
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank you think we're back in
 
00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
business yeah I I did read the bill and
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
I didn't see it so I just thought you
 
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
might have a better idea of the
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
intent if I if I may I agree with
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
representative leus I have a concern
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
about creating a class of employee
 
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
that's goal is to become an LNA but
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
there's no clear definition of when that
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
should happen so what would prevent um
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
creating this subclass that was there
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
forever without actually being able to
 
00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:38.630 align:start position:0%
forever without actually being able to
make

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
LNA Mr um shair if I could yes go ahead
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
representative so this is addressing my
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
concern which was I don't see any we've
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
we've had earlier bills where people who
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
worked in a certain position that didn't
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
have the training were allowed to
 
00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
continue that because they had either
 
00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
worked during the um the pandemic to
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
account for their training or they had
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
worked enough hours that they could be
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
promoted to that position they could get
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
license share for that I don't see that
 
00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:15.799 align:start position:0%
here I see that this is a tempor we're
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
creating class of people who are going
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
to receive lower pay and have lower
 
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
requirements and I don't that's my
 
00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:26.919 align:start position:0%
concern with this bill if these people
 
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
had access to the LNA position or it was
 
00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:34.039 align:start position:0%
a road to that um that's a whole
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
different thing so I think that's the
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
Crux of my concern with the bill and I
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate um everyone helping me get to
 
00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
that Pearson yes thank you Mr chairman
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
um my Aunt Janet was in the test class
 
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
for nurse practitioners in Massachusetts
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
40 years ago and they were called uh a
 
00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
variety of names not good enough to be a
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
doctor uh a subass I remember that but
 
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
what my aunt
 
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
demonstrated and the two nurse
 
00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:09.919 align:start position:0%
practitioners that are on under my
 
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
employee demonstrate is probably at age
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
22 they weren't ready to go to medical
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
school so they did come in eventually as
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
a subass called nurse practitioner uh
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
and some of the nurse practitioners now
 
00:26:28.029 --> 00:26:28.039 align:start position:0%
have gone back and uh become do or MDS
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
and that's a good thing many of them
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
stay where they are so subclass or lower
 
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
level uh I did I heard the snear behind
 
00:26:40.269 --> 00:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
the use of that term 40 years ago but I
 
00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
didn't see it as such I just saw it as
 
00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
somebody who could move from where she
 
00:26:48.909 --> 00:26:48.919 align:start position:0%
was to a better position and eventually
 
00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:50.919 align:start position:0%
uh some of them went on to be better yet
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
and better yet and better yet and I
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
could see temporary and I reiterate I
 
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
want a definition here a temporary AR
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
person coming in at a lower level is not
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily a bad thing I don't think
 
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
it's demeaning to people I think it may
 
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
be the lower rung on the ladder that
 
00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
they can best uh put their foot on at
 
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
this time and maybe come up higher and
 
00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
then higher
 
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
yet I am I tend to agree I don't have an
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
issue with uh with having a a separate
 
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
class that's a that's only there as a
 
00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.630 align:start position:0%
class that's a that's only there as a
stepping

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
stepping
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
stone but a temporary seems to be the
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
sticking point here
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
if when does that become no longer
 
00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you Mr chair um perhaps
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson can answer this
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
thought that occurred to me um we know
 
00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
that uh health care workers were granted
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh bonus pay if you would call it that
 
00:27:52.029 --> 00:27:52.039 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic were these folks
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
that um I don't know we would know that
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
that would be that would be dependent on
 
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
an employer that's not
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
a I was thinking perhaps Mr
 
00:28:07.509 --> 00:28:07.519 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson might know that
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
from his outside connection I see him
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
shaking his head no he does oh sorry
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
Schultz M sorry about that um I do see
 
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
still a lot of folks in the attendees
 
00:28:30.029 --> 00:28:30.039 align:start position:0%
list if any of them have an
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
understanding of how pay differential is
 
00:28:36.669 --> 00:28:36.679 align:start position:0%
for these two positions that would be
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
helpful it sounds like there are already
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
these sort of programs predominantly
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic but my you know
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
I would say if this gives folks a chance
 
00:28:51.789 --> 00:28:51.799 align:start position:0%
to earn a paycheck and avoid the student
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
loan debt from the LNA program training
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
programs um this actually might be net
 
00:29:01.389 --> 00:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
gain for them I think though LNA pay in
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
general and uh is it definitely in the
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
category of workers that definitely
 
00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919 align:start position:0%
needs a boost and maybe and I agree with
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
everything that representative goalie
 
00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
says about that but if the differential
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
in uh avoiding student loan debt for the
 
00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.430 align:start position:0%
in uh avoiding student loan debt for the
training

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
programs uh and they earn a paycheck at
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
the same time might be a better bargain
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
for that period I believe but it would
 
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
be nice to hear some confirmation of
 
00:29:32.669 --> 00:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
that from anyone in the field um I see
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
someone from Dartmouth Hitchcock is in
 
00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
the attendees list and other folks that
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
we know very well it would be great if
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
we could if I don't get the answer to
 
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
the question during the subcommittee I'm
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
definitely going to call around and get
 
00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:47.310 align:start position:0%
definitely going to call around and get
the

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
answer um from various sources I have if
 
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
anybody has any recommendations for that
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
because I think that's to me the biggest
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
sticking point if they're getting the
 
00:29:59.039 --> 00:30:00.149 align:start position:0%
sticking point if they're getting the
same

00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum uh they would get through the
 
00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:05.559 align:start position:0%
official training programs and they're
 
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
being paid and they're avoiding student
 
00:30:11.549 --> 00:30:11.559 align:start position:0%
loan debt I think this is a good path
 
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
actually but I don't have a confirmation
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
yet Mr um yes thank you I I think that's
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
an interesting um to know the pay
 
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
differential but I don't know that it's
 
00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.110 align:start position:0%
differential but I don't know that it's
necessarily

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
um necessarily important as far as
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
getting the language of the bill correct
 
00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
because the pay is going to be different
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
at every place and it's really going to
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
be set by the market I'm more concerned
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
about creating a permanent class of
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
people who would then be allowed to be
 
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
paid less because they don't have the
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
same credentials that an LNA would have
 
00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:50.519 align:start position:0%
this should only be a stepping to LNA
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
not a
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
permanent class of people that would be
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
paid lower so it's tangental in in that
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
in that regard um but it would be
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
interesting to know um representative
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
Allegro thank you uh thank you for
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm not on this
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
committee uh but I wanted to be here
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
this morning because I think this is
 
00:31:11.629 --> 00:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
important enough that I made the time to
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
come in early as someone who has done
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
work push wheelchairs white bottoms and
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
held hands um I know it's important work
 
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't rise at that to the same
 
00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.110 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't rise at that to the same
level

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
as what these people will aspire to I
 
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
just want to say that we had a shortage
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic we're going to have
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
a shortage after the pandemic and I
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
think we're getting a little far a field
 
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
in splitting hairs worrying about
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
creating an underclass and uh what their
 
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
pay is going to be and how temporary is
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
temporary uh I'll just finish by saying
 
00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:52.039 align:start position:0%
that there's there's no experience for a
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
position like this than um firsthand
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
practical experience and uh much more
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
important than than classroom training
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
and credits and that sort of stuff and I
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
support this uh way to um to ease the
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
way for people to get into this
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
profession as much as possible Mr chair
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Le uh thank you
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
actually am not concerned about a lack
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
of a definition of temporary as it seems
 
00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:24.710 align:start position:0%
of a definition of temporary as it seems
to

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
be language that isn't NE necessary I
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
mean I would support amending this to
 
00:32:31.389 --> 00:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
get rid of call them Health Partners and
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
get rid of temporary I mean if there if
 
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
somebody we're certainly gonna have the
 
00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.389 align:start position:0%
somebody we're certainly gonna have the
opportunity

00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:32:40.399 --> 00:32:43.149 align:start position:0%
opportunity
mesent

00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
mesent
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
speak understanding was you thought that
 
00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:48.919 align:start position:0%
could be further
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
delineated uh yes I
 
00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.710 align:start position:0%
delineated uh yes I
do

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay going on
 
00:33:01.789 --> 00:33:01.799 align:start position:0%
Sam you need to mute after this meeting
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
sorry okay thank you um anyway so I'd be
 
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
okay just calling them Health Partners
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
if they're there and getting the
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
experience they're certainly you they're
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
making some money and certainly have the
 
00:33:15.549 --> 00:33:15.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity if they choose to work
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
towards an LNA I don't think it needs to
 
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
be spelled out
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
explicitly um and if somebody is doesn't
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
want to do that for some reason and they
 
00:33:28.269 --> 00:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
want to continue for some period of time
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know maybe even a longer period of
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
time doing the kind of work under the
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
supervision of an LNA or you know RN or
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
um you know that the health partners are
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
do I'm I don't object to that although I
 
00:33:44.669 --> 00:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
would expect most of the people doing
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
this would uh take the opportunity to
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
move up and become lnas and you know be
 
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
a good opportunity for for them to do it
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
and at least make some money so I'd be
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
okay with that my my my only issue with
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
that theory is that it could clog the
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
position from people that would want to
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
earn their LNA if you had someone who
 
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
stayed in it said I'm just going to do
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
this well someone who might want to take
 
00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
advantage of that to get their LNA
 
00:34:08.919 --> 00:34:10.069 align:start position:0%
advantage of that to get their LNA
positions

00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:34:13.149 --> 00:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
full yeah I I don't know the the chance
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
of that given there's been this chronic
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
shortage and
 
00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:21.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair and I'm glad
 
00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
to see the discussion coming around to
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
the definition of temporary which was
 
00:34:28.589 --> 00:34:28.599 align:start position:0%
one of my bigger concerns um because
 
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
there is no definition and uh I hope we
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
stay on keeping this as a temporary
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
health partner and move these folks up
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
the chain to that shortage of lnas we
 
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
have um I guess my I have one question
 
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if we can get help from
 
00:34:46.589 --> 00:34:46.599 align:start position:0%
Pam or anybody out in the audience um is
 
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
the term temporary health partner used
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
in any other state and defined uh as to
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
what it is and that may help us on that
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
end if it is being used thank you help
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
us from Reinventing the
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
will M Marling are you aware of that if
 
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
that if that's that term is used
 
00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.310 align:start position:0%
that if that's that term is used
anywhere

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
else see sorry I'm I'm uh in another
 
00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.079 align:start position:0%
meet in and out of another meeting um I
 
00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:13.640 align:start position:0%
do not know off the top of my head but
 
00:35:17.069 --> 00:35:17.079 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to search and find out
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
you um
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
so real quick I think because I don't
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
want to stay on this section forever uh
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
do we all seem to agree that um a
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
definition of temporary would not hurt
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
and and for some of us actually help um
 
00:35:35.839 --> 00:35:36.829 align:start position:0%
and and for some of us actually help um
the

00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
Bell thumbs
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
up and would everyone probably support
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
it then if we could get that locked
 
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
down yeah okay if go ahead if that's
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
what the committee chooses to do my
 
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
preference actually would be to
 
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
eliminate all references to Temporary
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
but if the committee our subcommittee
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to do that then uh getting
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
the definition in I think would be
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
better than eliminating it the whole
 
00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
thing well I I don't I think yeah I I I
 
00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:09.319 align:start position:0%
prefer to have a to I to to get rid of
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
it all together would mean it was a
 
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
permanent subass of of medical without
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
the necessary impetus for going forward
 
00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
I think um but I think if we could just
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
keep it and Define temporary to a
 
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of time um I think
 
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
that it would still carry out the
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
function of the bill yet make everybody
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
comfortable we're not creating a
 
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
position just to be paid less um does
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
anyone have an ideas on the thoughts on
 
00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
the time period for
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
definition I had my hand up for a while
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm sorry I can't see you on
 
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
the screen but you go ahead M represent
 
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you Mr chairman so uh just
 
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
let's bring this back into the focus
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
that this uh this section and this idea
 
00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
is primarily for the benefit of the
 
00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
nursing homes not primarily for the
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
benefit of the people that are going to
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
be employed uh it is being driven by the
 
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
fact that the nursing homes urgently
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
crucially need people to do these
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
significant important vital tasks um
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
even because they're and representative
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
Lea said it a moment ago they're under
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
supervision so not being you know put in
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
as free agents here they're going to be
 
00:37:34.109 --> 00:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
under supervision but doing fundamental
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
tasks that don't take a lot of training
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
they they just take some uh uh some
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
guidance um so the temporary aspect
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
clearly in my mind has something to do
 
00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
with a pandemic we're not done with a
 
00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:49.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic no matter how much we would
 
00:37:54.309 --> 00:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
like to be um and uh and as long as
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's the case uh we we we have to also
 
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
take care because one of the aspects of
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
the pandemic is that you can have
 
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
somebody who's in a job whatever the
 
00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
position might be who uh comes in
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
contact is exposed to the virus and has
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
to stop working for for a couple of
 
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
weeks uh unlike me many other situations
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
they're kind of get a timeout uh and so
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
that makes the the pandemic the the
 
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.190 align:start position:0%
that makes the the pandemic the the
underlying

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
underlying
 
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
premise of this whole situation and if
 
00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
you want to tie it into that fine if
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
somebody can come up with a language but
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of this that I wanted
 
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
to address is we don't have to legislate
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
every damn thing folks uh because once
 
00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
this this statute is uh in place uh then
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
you're going to have rules written and
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
they can get into all kinds of details
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
as long as the statute enables that so
 
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
uh I think we are uh this is beating
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
kind of beating a dead horse in a way
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
well the committee appreciates your
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
in I appreciate that Mr
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr
 
00:39:10.349 --> 00:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
chair as long as
 
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:13.720 align:start position:0%
um was um
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me just hold on a
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
second I wanted to respond to
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid sorry the um the
 
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic isn't mentioned in the statute
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
and it permanently creates the the
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
category of temporary health part
 
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
so we have to comp contemplate well
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
beyond the pandemic in the ramifications
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
this would have going forward so I I
 
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
agree that the pandemic is what the
 
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
impetus of all of this is but this
 
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
statute doesn't contemplate just the
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic it goes forward so I think it
 
00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
it would behoove us to have at least a
 
00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
definition of something that we're
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
permanently putting in statute um I'm
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
not I'm not fighting the the idea that a
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
definition would be helpful but what I'm
 
00:39:57.309 --> 00:39:57.319 align:start position:0%
saying is that the pandemic is to me is
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
the driving force for this because
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that the pandemic
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
constantly threatens uh a workers's
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
ability to continue at that particular
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
time if they've been exposed to the
 
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
virus now uh now that we have a vaccine
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's T that's showing itself to be
 
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
quite efficacious uh we can perhaps um
 
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of incidents of people
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
having to take that time out but the
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic I think is the time frame that
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
we're operating in I think it's but
 
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
continue if you can come up with a with
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
a good definition I don't have I don't
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
have any opposition to that thank you uh
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson thank you Mr
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
chairman uh on the other computer on my
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
desk I've been doing research as to what
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
might be called an underclass in medical
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
providers um I've noticed that during a
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
very bad emergency that we were under in
 
00:40:58.829 --> 00:40:58.839 align:start position:0%
this country called World War II we ran
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
out of our ends and so there became a
 
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
temporary group called LPN but they
 
00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
found that LPN freed RNs to do more what
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
RNs were trained to do So lpn's
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
eventually evolved into an honorable uh
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
level of medical care so even these
 
00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
temps we're looking at here um I would
 
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
not want to see them as underclass I
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
would want to see them as another the
 
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
layer of helpful Personnel uh that we
 
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
need and we don't just need when the
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic runs its course uh we're going
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
to need them we need them now we needed
 
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
them before in our County nursing homes
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
and other places so you know lpn's uh
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
started off the way this group is
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
starting off it seems from what I'm
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
reading on the
 
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
screen agre I think we all agree that
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
that the position itself is is worthy of
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
discussion I just I think we also agree
 
00:41:57.069 --> 00:41:57.079 align:start position:0%
that it
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
if we put a definition on on temporary
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
to get these folks to the LNA level as
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
reasonably quick as possible um the
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
better off everyone involved would be um
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
so with that said does anyone have an
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
idea or thoughts on u a definition of
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
temporary for this so that we can move
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
on Mr ker I do see someone in the
 
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
attendees list with their hand up if
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
that's something you want to recognize
 
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
sorry that may or may not be to the Top
 
00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:28.559 align:start position:0%
If You stated yeah that's the I've also
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
had my hand up oh well you would go
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
first representative G sorry thank you
 
00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:39.800 align:start position:0%
um I think that it would if we had um if
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
we looked up the requirements for
 
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
becoming an L whatever uh hours I have
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
two I have two uh thoughts number one uh
 
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
as long as we make this a stepping stone
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
to something else this is fine um if we
 
00:42:58.589 --> 00:42:58.599 align:start position:0%
create this position as as an entry to
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
the LNA that's fine I was for many
 
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
summer jobs in LNA
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
myself um so um and then the other thing
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
is I'm concerned about how many of these
 
00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.349 align:start position:0%
is I'm concerned about how many of these
elenas

00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
elenas
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
would how many how many Lenas I mean how
 
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
many these temporary health workers are
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
nurse was supervised because as you know
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
we have a stressful situation with that
 
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
group of workers as as well so I would
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we limit we have
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of of uh we have a
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
limit on that supervision how many you
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
know and and if we want to do that in
 
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
rules or if we want input from The
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
Nurses Association on that before we
 
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:43.640 align:start position:0%
decide that that's fine I recommend that
 
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
we would look at the um hours of on the
 
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
job training an LNA has and make it
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
equivalent to that so if they have the
 
00:43:57.309 --> 00:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
the practicum hours that an l would have
 
00:44:02.589 --> 00:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:05.800 align:start position:0%
temporary can you look that up yeah I'll
 
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
look it up right
 
00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.990 align:start position:0%
look it up right
now

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking to see does this have
 
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
does this statute have a a Ru
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
making rule making clause in it that
 
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
made um first let me see this person in
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
the audience um if they're asking to
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
out Mr hilts has hand yeah that's who I
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.990 align:start position:0%
 
contribute

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
contribute
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
hello you're
 
00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:01.910 align:start position:0%
hello you're
muted

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
sir I did not have my hand up you did
 
00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:08.839 align:start position:0%
not okay actually you did but that's all
 
00:45:08.839 --> 00:45:12.829 align:start position:0%
not okay actually you did but that's all
right

00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
stand go ahead represent
 
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
it suggest it would seem reasonable to
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
um have the temporary time frame aligned
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
with the amount of time that uh a normal
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
process for lure to obtain LNA would be
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh considered
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable I believe representative Gro
 
00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
is that up right now I think
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure how
 
00:45:58.349 --> 00:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
I can also tell you that the average
 
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
salary in New Hampshire for an LNA is
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
hour again I'm not sure how you would
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
Define the time period but uh I'm sure
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
there's some kind of standard that oplc
 
00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:23.430 align:start position:0%
there's some kind of standard that oplc
could

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
provide all right we're going to um
 
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to move on we all agree that
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to get a definition and
 
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
everyone seems to be in favor of once we
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
can Define this two hours 200 hours two
 
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
hours 200
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
um the completion a
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
challenge there's a test and um a
 
00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
fundamental nursing
 
00:46:52.119 --> 00:46:53.790 align:start position:0%
fundamental nursing
course

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
um which
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
I I do think that this would be a good
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
um discussion to have with
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
oplc but I think I think 200 hours is a
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
good number for temporary well that's
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
only five
 
00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
weeks that's what that's what it is yeah
 
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that I don't think
 
00:47:16.829 --> 00:47:16.839 align:start position:0%
that's going to
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
fulfill what the statute contemplates
 
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
but I agree we should talk about this
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
yeah are you saying that in Li of
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
training we could extend the working
 
00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
hours towards the
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
license well the statute proposed Bill
 
00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
already contemplates um somebody working
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
for a certain amount of time in lie of
 
00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
the necessary other training okay all
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
right so it would be okay I understand
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
so maybe 250 hours or
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
something we'll get
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
some oplc all right let's move on to the
 
00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
have any comments to start that
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
discussion I believe it's regarding
 
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist
 
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
assistance isn't it on page two starting
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
at line
 
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
11 emergency licensing process oh yeah I
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
missed that one that's correct emergency
 
00:48:18.839 --> 00:48:21.230 align:start position:0%
missed that one that's correct emergency
licensing

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
process um representative Pearson thank
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
you not surprising not surprisingly um
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
this was the kind of thing that would
 
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
come up in health and human services and
 
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
did and uh the only question about it
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
that uh a couple of members raised was
 
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
the idea that no required continuing
 
00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
education was mandated but we all know
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm married to a physician
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
they can't stop reading stuff so they
 
00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:01.720 align:start position:0%
read the journals even if there's no
 
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
requirement but we found that in an
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
emergency and that's clearly what this
 
00:49:10.349 --> 00:49:10.359 align:start position:0%
is people who have let their license
 
00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
lapse uh but there's no disciplinary
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
action involved would be helpful in
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
emergencies so uh this this bill didn't
 
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
come to us but uh your chair did send it
 
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
to me and said read it over and talk it
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
over with some of your committee people
 
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
and uh we're pretty good with this about
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
licensing Physicians from our state and
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
from other states whose licenses have
 
00:49:35.599 --> 00:49:37.589 align:start position:0%
from other states whose licenses have
recently

00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:39.319 align:start position:0%
lapsed thank
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
you anyone on the
 
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:45.640 align:start position:0%
committee I'm okay with
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
if you want if you wanted to deal with
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
that if you really wanted it just under
 
00:50:03.309 --> 00:50:03.319 align:start position:0%
a declared state of emergency it could
 
00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:05.240 align:start position:0%
say that under a state of
 
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
emergency you know declared by the well
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
the governor there or the legislature
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
which are the two bodies that can do
 
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
it but uh which I think is sort of
 
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
implied but it could be clearer I guess
 
00:50:22.109 --> 00:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
yeah C emergency that mean there's you
 
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
know RSA for colon whatever um defines
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
that represent
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
pear thank you Mr chairman uh I would
 
00:50:35.069 --> 00:50:35.079 align:start position:0%
stretch I would want a broader
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
definition here uh when I was nine years
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
old uh two of the doctors in my hometown
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
died and one of them was away on the
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
Good Ship hope and we dragged doc Hilton
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
out of retirement he was 91 and sharp as
 
00:50:50.829 --> 00:50:50.839 align:start position:0%
attack uh we just dragged him out
 
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
because we could there wasn't anybody
 
00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
that said we couldn't at that time the
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
idea of hopping into a car or more
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
likely back then hopping on the bus and
 
00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
going to the next city to find a doctor
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
was probably not possible or likely so
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
the idea that in that localized
 
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
emergency that lasted until doc uh
 
00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
Goldman came back from his uh Good Ship
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
hope and uh we secured another doctor
 
00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
for the town it was good to have doc
 
00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
Hilton available on a very localized
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
emergency basis this bill is written
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
would allow for things like that if it
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
said it was a Statewide emergency as
 
00:51:28.789 --> 00:51:28.799 align:start position:0%
declared by Governor Council legislature
 
00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:31.799 align:start position:0%
some combination uh it would eliminate
 
00:51:34.589 --> 00:51:34.599 align:start position:0%
that situation and its solution that we
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
had back in Massachusetts in the
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
1950s but if it was an emergency who was
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
left up to the medical board to determin
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
oh okay I'm agree with you think that
 
00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:49.240 align:start position:0%
would fulfill that represent Pearson I
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
think so yeah nowadays that's what we
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
would do medical board would be
 
00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
petitioned by locality saying we have an
 
00:51:59.710 --> 00:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
emergency and can we invoke this statute
 
00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:01.470 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:04.510 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
[Music]

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair and I I too um
 
00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
I agree that I think emergencies should
 
00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
be defined and I think it should be a
 
00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
state of emergency or emergency declared
 
00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
by this legislature um as we all know
 
00:52:22.589 --> 00:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
one person's uh definition of emergency
 
00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
is different than another person's
 
00:52:27.309 --> 00:52:27.319 align:start position:0%
definition of emergency um so I I think
 
00:52:29.309 --> 00:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh very very leeway and just leaving it
 
00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:37.240 align:start position:0%
as an emergency I think uh the first um
 
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
reference to making a declared state of
 
00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:43.720 align:start position:0%
emergency is uh more suffice thank you
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
representative goie what are your
 
00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
thoughts on on uh the example that
 
00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
representative pierer brought up as a
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
locality has a a shortage of of of
 
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
doctors in their locality where the
 
00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
medical board would be able to declare a
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
statute I just have concerns like I said
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
one person's definition of emergency is
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
different than anothers and I think by
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
leaving it very broad um May defeat the
 
00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
purpose of what this part of the statute
 
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
was intended for um I think we we know
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
of a lot of areas in the state
 
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
where um the need for Health Care um
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
individuals have to travel
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
a distance to get to the healthare they
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
need um and I I don't think this is the
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
solution to that
 
00:53:38.589 --> 00:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
problem well perhaps not but it it it
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
might it might help um and I'm not
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
suggesting leaving it AB broad I'm
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
suggesting actually defining it an
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
emergency as declared a state emergency
 
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
by the governor or a local medical
 
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
emergency as defined by the State
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
Medical Board um in that would be
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
limited to a shortage of medical
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
providers in an area and it would be
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
that um I would have to read into this
 
00:54:10.829 --> 00:54:10.839 align:start position:0%
just a little bit further I know some of
 
00:54:14.589 --> 00:54:14.599 align:start position:0%
this talks about uh nursing students and
 
00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
um giving them temporary lure five month
 
00:54:21.069 --> 00:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
months prior to um their graduation and
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
stuff of that nature um we know there
 
00:54:24.829 --> 00:54:24.839 align:start position:0%
are shortages of nurses is that going to
 
00:54:24.839 --> 00:54:26.150 align:start position:0%
are shortages of nurses is that going to
be

00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
part considered an emergency for a
 
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
hospital that they really need nurses
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
and we're going to be handing out
 
00:54:32.789 --> 00:54:32.799 align:start position:0%
licenses five months ahead of time um
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
and that's my
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
concern when we we all know that they
 
00:54:39.069 --> 00:54:39.079 align:start position:0%
should be graduating to get their
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
license um before they go into the
 
00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.150 align:start position:0%
license um before they go into the
medical

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you Mr chair um point of
 
00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
interest on the previous question about
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
the temporary health workers uh I had
 
00:54:59.549 --> 00:54:59.559 align:start position:0%
reached out to the head of my County
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
nursing home while we were discussing it
 
00:55:04.589 --> 00:55:04.599 align:start position:0%
he was in a meeting but he just got back
 
00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
to me um he's reasonably sure that those
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
temporary workers did get the Frontline
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
stipend uh in pay that was put out he
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately was not able to find
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
anyone willing to work in that capacity
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
at our nursing home which I had thought
 
00:55:29.029 --> 00:55:29.039 align:start position:0%
that was the case but I wanted to verify
 
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
it with him that was part of my question
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
about interest in this particular that
 
00:55:39.549 --> 00:55:39.559 align:start position:0%
particular category uh and I think as he
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
stated the lower tear of New Hampshire
 
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
probably had a lot of folks interested
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
but from Marram County North probably
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
not so much thank you thank you U
 
00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:53.990 align:start position:0%
not so much thank you thank you U
representative

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
Pearson uh thank you Mr chairman uh we
 
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
spent a long time in Health Human
 
00:56:03.069 --> 00:56:03.079 align:start position:0%
Services and elderly Affairs committee
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
discussing underserved populations in
 
00:56:08.109 --> 00:56:08.119 align:start position:0%
the state we had considered we are still
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
considering a bill that would uh license
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
a graduate of a medical school with an
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
MD or do in his or her hand but not
 
00:56:23.069 --> 00:56:23.079 align:start position:0%
matched for a Residency program and some
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
of us cringed at that because if you
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
didn't match either you didn't apply to
 
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
enough places or people they got your
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
number and they don't want you and so
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
we're thinking about either in some
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
places having no doctor on hand or
 
00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
having a nurse served like a doctor or
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
having a retired person who is uh let
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
his license laps and wants to come back
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
for a few years and none of this is
 
00:56:50.349 --> 00:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
terribly happy with this and we're
 
00:56:53.069 --> 00:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
looking at some alternatives on how do
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
we populate underserved areas and this
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
is a big concern and believe me this
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
isn't going away once this section of
 
00:57:02.829 --> 00:57:02.839 align:start position:0%
this bill is dealt with it's going to
 
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
come back in force in the next few years
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
um as I say we've discussed this in some
 
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
depth and wish we could have fully
 
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
completely trained licensed people in
 
00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:17.240 align:start position:0%
every slot fact is we don't have that so
 
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
what is our fallback position that's
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
what we're really working
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
through thank you representative G
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
thank you I empathize with um
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson and the um indust
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
and the medical industry and the Service
 
00:57:37.029 --> 00:57:37.039 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire however let's be let's
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
be uh let's look at it from the St the
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint of the people that were
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
serving right we're
 
00:57:49.029 --> 00:57:49.039 align:start position:0%
underserved um in almost every area
 
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
whether it be the medical field or the
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
daycare industry
 
00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%
or there's many many industries that we
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
can look at New Hampshire and say we
 
00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:01.240 align:start position:0%
could do something a little bit better
 
00:58:04.349 --> 00:58:04.359 align:start position:0%
but we're also in this legis in this in
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
this group passing legislation that
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
affects the lives of
 
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
people and their health and I would not
 
00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:15.160 align:start position:0%
want to do anything um the the concept
 
00:58:17.309 --> 00:58:17.319 align:start position:0%
of well someone is better than no
 
00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
one is not my idea
 
00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:24.520 align:start position:0%
of of a pragmatic or safe approach so
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
let's is take into consideration that
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
although we have a
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
need we just
 
00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.470 align:start position:0%
need we just
can't

00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
um throw bodies at the problem without
 
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
thinking of the responsibility that we
 
00:58:42.829 --> 00:58:42.839 align:start position:0%
have to the people that are being served
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
who will trust these
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
individuals who will trust them like we
 
00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:52.839 align:start position:0%
trust our medical profession thank
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you represent pearon you like
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
to respond to yes to respond to the
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative believe me in a room full
 
00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
of Physicians including the former
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire Medical
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
Society we would not Advocate throwing
 
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
anybody at the problem we would
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
Advocate throwing or placing someone who
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
is a level down at the problem at the
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
people remember doctors care a lot about
 
00:59:24.359 --> 00:59:25.470 align:start position:0%
people remember doctors care a lot about
people

00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
nurses care a lot about people Medical
 
00:59:31.029 --> 00:59:31.039 align:start position:0%
Health administrators like me care a lot
 
00:59:33.549 --> 00:59:33.559 align:start position:0%
about people we wouldn't take anybody in
 
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
fact during the pandemic we rejected two
 
00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
people who applied for jobs here for the
 
00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
very reason we would take a good quality
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
person whose training isn't as high as
 
00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
we all wish it could be until we do some
 
00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
very serious work at how do we
 
00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
incentivize such people going to
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
undeserved areas how much of the their
 
00:59:57.029 --> 00:59:57.039 align:start position:0%
tuition do we pay how much of their
 
01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
moving expenses do we pay that's for the
 
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
future and we hope not very far in the
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
future but as of right now as of today
 
01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
no not anybody at the problem but
 
01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
certain specially uh vetted people who
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
don't quite have the qualifications
 
01:00:17.029 --> 01:00:17.039 align:start position:0%
that's really the conclusion that we are
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
coming towards in Health and Human
 
01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.029 align:start position:0%

01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
section that one is dealing that's a
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
separate thing dealing with them uh the
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
first section four was dealing with uh
 
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
Co tus yeah and section five is
 
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
administering covid vaccines section
 
01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.109 align:start position:0%
administering covid vaccines section
five

01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:02:26.829 --> 01:02:26.839 align:start position:0%
so the covid test was section four and
 
01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
everybody seemed to be in agreement with
 
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
that now let's talk about section five
 
01:02:32.589 --> 01:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
the Pharmacists and Pharmacy technici
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
administering covid vaccines does anyone
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
have anything to say or any issues with
 
01:02:36.799 --> 01:02:38.309 align:start position:0%
have anything to say or any issues with
that

01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
section everyone seems to be okay with
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
that yeah my only comment would be it's
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
pretty narrow and I'm I'm okay with that
 
01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
it's just if we end up with a variant
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
that's no longer called covid-19 then it
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
won't apply but I think aren't all the
 
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
variants just subvariants of Co they may
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
be I don't know I don't have any
 
01:02:59.829 --> 01:02:59.839 align:start position:0%
objection to it okay uh representative
 
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
pearon you wanted to say something uh
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
yeah the next one may be called covid
 
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
25 and while that is funny uh it's
 
01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
pretty darn serious because we have no
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
guarantee we won't get another covid
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
type in a handful of years um so I'm not
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
knowing what I'm suggesting here and
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
rename it uh uh give it its generic
 
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
wider term but covid-19 yeah we'll be
 
01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
done with covid-19 but the next one will
 
01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.710 align:start position:0%
done with covid-19 but the next one will
be

01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:03:33.069 --> 01:03:33.079 align:start position:0%
coming yeah it does seem that we're
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
we're getting to this um at the
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully what's the tail end of this
 
01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
and the need for it but to your point it
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
would be handy to
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
have regardless of what the right I mean
 
01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:50.359 align:start position:0%
I'd be okay making it administering any
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
vaccine unless but maybe there's reasons
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
not to do that but I don't I don't know
 
01:03:55.589 --> 01:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
if that would uh that would cross too
 
01:03:58.829 --> 01:03:58.839 align:start position:0%
many lines go ahead representative
 
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you this comes out of the
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
uh counterpart Committee in the Senate
 
01:04:07.789 --> 01:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
to mine in the house and um Senator
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
Bradley was thinking more directly about
 
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
what's right in front of us not taking a
 
01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
position not even thinking about what
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
might be Beyond and yeah emergency law
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
is good but if it's good for this it
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
might be good for the next one and quite
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
possibly the word covid-19 could be
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
replaced with a better term that I don't
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
have handy in my mind right at the
 
01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
moment I just think that that would be a
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
better uh subject for your community to
 
01:04:36.109 --> 01:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
take up in another bill because um
 
01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
there's so many different vaccines of
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
possible side effects that we wouldn't
 
01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:43.799 align:start position:0%
want just want allow at yeah um so
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
similar issues with four for testing as
 
01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
well it says covid-19 covid-19 I I I
 
01:04:51.069 --> 01:04:51.079 align:start position:0%
would recommend that we just um we leave
 
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
these as they are and just pass them and
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
let them be used so remainer of this
 
01:04:57.269 --> 01:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
covid-19 issue and if it seems like a
 
01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
good idea can be brought up in another
 
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
bill to you this should have been I
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
think if some of these were not combined
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
and were separate bills they could have
 
01:05:07.829 --> 01:05:07.839 align:start position:0%
gone to uh representative Pearson's
 
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
committee and yeah we're floundering
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a lot of expertise
 
01:05:16.829 --> 01:05:16.839 align:start position:0%
in this are okay um moving along um
 
01:05:16.839 --> 01:05:19.269 align:start position:0%
in this are okay um moving along um
section

01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
six mail order facilities uh out State
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
pharmacies is temporary uh
 
01:05:24.599 --> 01:05:26.470 align:start position:0%
pharmacies is temporary uh
representative

01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
Pearson muted oh he doesn't want no
 
01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:32.799 align:start position:0%
you're waving off um represent LE yeah I
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
mean this is actually extremely limited
 
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's for them to be able to ship in
 
01:05:41.349 --> 01:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh drugs for people that are on
 
01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
clinical trials um and those aren't I
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
mean I think this is good in general for
 
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
that situation
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
because you know that way you can get
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
the drug sent here if it's appropr
 
01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
let's say you're dealing the trials down
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
in Boston or even somewhere else no
 
01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
travel yeah I mean I again I don't have
 
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
any particular expertise in this area
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
but I don't see um any problem with
 
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
this anyone else like to speak on the
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
straightforward this is on the section
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
on that on the um pharmacist this is the
 
01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
section on the out ofate um pharmacies
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
temporarily being able no I'm fine
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right then we're all good on
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
that let's move on to section
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
seven next section you know what page
 
01:06:32.559 --> 01:06:32.820 align:start position:0%
seven next section you know what page
it's

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:32.830 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:34.190 align:start position:0%
it's
[Music]

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
on oh
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
yeah this is on the construction workers
 
01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
I think um no seven I think this is the
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
summer camp thing where if summer oh
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
okay they were grandfathered in but they
 
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
could lose their grandfather and if they
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
weren't able to operate um last year or
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
this you know last summer or this summer
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
I I certainly support this yeah this
 
01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:02.839 align:start position:0%
this is a um this is a common sense this
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
is just fixing what co co wrecked um
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else have any comments or
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
concerns about section 7 with summer
 
01:07:16.029 --> 01:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
camps no okay um let's move
 
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
on Mr chair yes go ahead one quick one
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
as I'm going through it right now
 
01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
um I just have one question as to and I
 
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
don't see it in here and I don't know if
 
01:07:32.269 --> 01:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
we can get an answer um does this piece
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
of the statute does this Sunset so I
 
01:07:37.269 --> 01:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
mean once this year's over it should be
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we need to keep this in
 
01:07:41.309 --> 01:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
place I think we can Sunset it once
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
we're through the uh amending
 
01:07:47.309 --> 01:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
it you're you're referring to the summer
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
camps right there that one is correct
 
01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
there are some perspective appeals at
 
01:07:58.269 --> 01:07:58.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:05.269 --> 01:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
ones correct represent I think there are
 
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
some repeals in the end that I haven't
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
got to yet yeah there's uh there are for
 
01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.269 align:start position:0%
got to yet yeah there's uh there are for
the

01:08:14.269 --> 01:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh emergency licensing procedures we
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
were discussing a little bit
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
ago and the the one we just spoke about
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
the outut ofate pharmacy's temporary
 
01:08:25.390 --> 01:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
licenses mail
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
order let's see and also the expansion
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
of outdoor
 
01:08:36.269 --> 01:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
dining but I don't
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
see well this this section of the statue
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
only pertains to camps that were not
 
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
able to operate in
 
01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
2020 and and fixes the grandfathering
 
01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
issue whether or not the statute sunsets
 
01:08:54.349 --> 01:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
it it kind of automattic ically doeses
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
on its own because it only refers to the
 
01:08:58.749 --> 01:08:58.759 align:start position:0%
camps that weren't operate be able to
 
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
operate in 2020 correct yeah I think the
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
only reason
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
for um maybe doing an amendment to have
 
01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
it go away um after next year is just to
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
keep the statutes a little
 
01:09:14.349 --> 01:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
cleaner yeah and I'd be okay with that
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay is that would everyone be okay with
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
that having this section
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
sunet can you make a note of that for me
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
ton y all
 
01:09:22.719 --> 01:09:24.309 align:start position:0%
ton y all
right

01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
anything else uh uh representative
 
01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
goalie you good with that if we Sunset
 
01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
it I am good with it I just don't think
 
01:09:33.309 --> 01:09:33.319 align:start position:0%
it needs to be kept on the books uh just
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
make it confusing we no longer it good
 
01:09:38.669 --> 01:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
point yeah the statutes are big enough
 
01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
as it is yeah they are all right um so
 
01:09:45.709 --> 01:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
now we move on to section
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
eight construction during a during
 
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
covid-19 anyone have any comments or
 
01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts in this
 
01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.590 align:start position:0%
thoughts in this
[Music]

01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
section I have some comments on this
 
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
please representative cor so although um
 
01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.709 align:start position:0%
please representative cor so although um
there

01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
are it doesn't allow people construction
 
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
people to
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
build um without meeting the building
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
codes of the
 
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
towns my concern is that in towns such
 
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:24.280 align:start position:0%
as ours where a significant
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
portion of the
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
town is in because 65% of our town is
 
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
the is
 
01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
wetland we have strict buffer rules and
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
to protect the marshes and in the
 
01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
wetlands and this is not unlike other
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
towns that have their own conservation
 
01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
areas and are protecting them for
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
environmental or Wildlife or um other
 
01:10:52.719 --> 01:10:55.990 align:start position:0%
environmental or Wildlife or um other
reasons

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.189 --> 01:11:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
um what do I say how do there there's no
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
repercussions for building something
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
where it shouldn't be built and
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
destroying um
 
01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
our protected environmental
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
lands so I don't know
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
how to incorporate that into this kind
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
of legislation
 
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
but um and although I empathize with the
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
in you know the UN the uh that in small
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
towns maybe the building inspector isn't
 
01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
available or the or the town hall is
 
01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.189 align:start position:0%
available or the or the town hall is
closed

01:11:41.189 --> 01:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
closed
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
or but somehow there has to
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
well any other thoughts on this section
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
I mean if I could yeses um I mean they
 
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:01.570 align:start position:0%
have to send in the
 
01:12:01.570 --> 01:12:02.669 align:start position:0%
have to send in the
[Music]

01:12:02.669 --> 01:12:02.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
documentation um and there's nothing you
 
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
know if if the M if the municipal
 
01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
officials do respond there's nothing to
 
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
prevent that I understand the concern
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
yeah it does seem to um it does seem to
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
let them just go on um right and that's
 
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
that is is any anyone in the attendees
 
01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
from the municipal Association or anyone
 
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
who could uh speak to us about this
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
raise your hand if you are a little
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
disappointed in the lack
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
of we go as a
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%

muted uh thank you everyone good morning
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
everyone um I admit I am multitasking
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
and also listening to your work session
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
here this morning so which which section
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
have we gotten to here this morning we
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
are on the section uh section eight
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with continuing construction
 
01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:13.070 align:start position:0%
dealing with continuing construction
during

01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
covid-19 sorry page six line 25 yeah
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
page six line
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
25 can you hear me a little better now
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
oh I see so this was a section which I'm
 
01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
sure you've already discussed here this
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
morning this was a section that was
 
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
added when um construction was you know
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
construction industry was concerned
 
01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
about being able to continue or do work
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
during covid when building inspectors
 
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
and building officials um may not be
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
available to go on site or were City
 
01:13:55.629 --> 01:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
Hall Town Hall was shut down things of
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
that nature so this was put in place to
 
01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
allow construction to continue but also
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
to put some parameters around it so that
 
01:14:05.629 --> 01:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
it was still being done safely and and
 
01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
in good faith and all of those important
 
01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
things during covid um I have not heard
 
01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:16.280 align:start position:0%
my understanding at this point is that
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
cities and towns even if they are doing
 
01:14:21.149 --> 01:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
you know some hybrid work some remote
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
work or limiting the public in
 
01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
City buildings Town buildings that they
 
01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
are relatively back to normal with these
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
sorts of operations doing Building
 
01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
Inspections um certainly they're holding
 
01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
their planning board hearings and
 
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
they're moving forward with things like
 
01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
that I am not hearing that this is a
 
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
concern that they need sort of the the
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
protection for I don't know if the
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
construction industry or any of those
 
01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
folks have a different uh perspective
 
01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
but I am not hearing the same kind of
 
01:14:59.950 --> 01:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
concern I did in April of last year when
 
01:15:01.709 --> 01:15:01.719 align:start position:0%
cities and towns were concerned how they
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
were going to um help this happen with
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
with covid and especially in the
 
01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
beginning when we didn't know exactly
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
what the right protocol was to keep
 
01:15:13.629 --> 01:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
people safe so that's that's what I'm
 
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
hearing and I'm happy to answer
 
01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
questions I apologize that I did not
 
01:15:19.709 --> 01:15:19.719 align:start position:0%
hear your earlier discussion no that's
 
01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
fine and I appreciate your input Mr BR
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
Maguire Mr chair I just want to mention
 
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
that during the hearing I too heard that
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
this was no longer necessary that the
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
emergency order worked for the period it
 
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
was needed and that by now it's not it's
 
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
not necessary to put it into statute
 
01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
so that was said by several people at
 
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
and I hope we can just delete the
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
section and not have to worry about it
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I to agree thank you it's a couple
 
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
sections in this uh omnus legislation
 
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
appear to be on the cusp of no longer
 
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
being necessary um and this is certainly
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
one of them unless there's anyone from
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
the construction industry and the
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
attendees that would like to weigh in we
 
01:16:13.709 --> 01:16:13.719 align:start position:0%
will move
 
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
along does everyone agree that this
 
01:16:19.229 --> 01:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
section um we could do away with it
 
01:16:19.239 --> 01:16:22.110 align:start position:0%
section um we could do away with it
yes

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:16:25.229 --> 01:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
yes right let's I don't see any other
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
hands raised so we're going to move
 
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
along this is a long section I'm glad
 
01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
we're doing that section nine liquor
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
licenses and fees expansion of outdoor
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
dining would like to start this one
 
01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
looks like it's gonna and have a little
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
more discussion who would like to begin
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.950 align:start position:0%
 
say

01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
um now this is just for the Liquor
 
01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:51.400 align:start position:0%
Commission correct this piece of Li
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
right as I I heard other legislation
 
01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
where there was discussion
 
01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.590 align:start position:0%
where there was discussion
about

01:16:58.590 --> 01:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:01.400 align:start position:0%
um outdoor dining in general that wasn't
 
01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily pertaining to the Liquor
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
Commission and it seems to me that the
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
two statutes would have to operate in
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
be so RSA what's RSA 143 143 a 4 forget
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
what that is I'll look at
 
01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
it that's the the existing one then yeah
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
and the question is does it touch on
 
01:17:38.189 --> 01:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
right Ian off top of my head I don't
 
01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
have I don't think the concern is going
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
to be with the liquor service outside as
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
much as it's going to be with the zoning
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
in general outdoor dining issue and that
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
was dealt with in a separate
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
bill um anyone have any feelings or
 
01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this with regard to allowing
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission to extend go ahead
 
01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:01.149 align:start position:0%

Goen thank you Mr chair I just want to
 
01:18:07.229 --> 01:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
bring up the point I think we heard from
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services about expanding
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
outdoor dining and some issues they had
 
01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
with that with those that are on septic
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
systems if I believe this is a section
 
01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
they testified on I don't think so I
 
01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
think this is only referring to liquor I
 
01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
know what you're talking about because I
 
01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
heard the same testimony I think that
 
01:18:25.629 --> 01:18:25.639 align:start position:0%
was I think that was in a separate bill
 
01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
was it 133 that um that would
 
01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:33.560 align:start position:0%
allow restaurants to open up outside and
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
kind of he kind of ignored the local
 
01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.110 align:start position:0%
kind of he kind of ignored the local
zoning

01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
issues that's correct that was that was
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
that was that was that bill okay
 
01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.330 align:start position:0%
that was that was that bill okay

Maguire no 133 does not deal without
 
01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:53.239 align:start position:0%
outoor dining this is the section on
 
01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:57.710 align:start position:0%
outdoor dining we had and I believe the
 
01:18:57.710 --> 01:18:59.390 align:start position:0%
outdoor dining we had and I believe the
[Music]

01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
point want to make is that this does not
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
change any of the local licensing
 
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
requirements for example if they have a
 
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
capacity limit of a 100 people it
 
01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't matter to their water sewer
 
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
systems that those people are sitting
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
inside or out and I believe that's what
 
01:19:25.229 --> 01:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
the op is doing is allowing more people
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
outside because they want
 
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
to limit
 
01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
indoor air loing and allow people to
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
spread out
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
further but the locality still have all
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
the authority they ever did to limit the
 
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
number of people in a
 
01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
facility thank
 
01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
you 143a colon 4 is um about a food food
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
um and later on in this section it deals
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
separately with the uh the liquor
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
license um but I think what Carol says
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
it still still applies still the case so
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
yeah as long as the locality still has
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
all the authority they originally had to
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
limit um go ahead representative
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
gold thank you Mr chair the only the
 
01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
only other issue I had with this is I'm
 
01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
why we need to go through to 2023 um as
 
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
we are seeing things are starting to
 
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
open up again and uh with the
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and those uh covid
 
01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
declining um I would think by the end of
 
01:20:40.030 --> 01:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
this summer uh
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
2022 um we should be all set to get rid
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
of this temporary order and not for all
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
of next summer as well um I think this
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
one should end uh through 2022 but
 
01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
that's just my
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
opinion only uh push back I would have
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
on that is that um I I'd like to I'd
 
01:21:02.189 --> 01:21:02.199 align:start position:0%
like to not to have to revisit this if a
 
01:21:05.790 --> 01:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
new substrain pops up and if we can give
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
ourselves a cushion I don't know that it
 
01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
would necessarily hurt to have it in
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
there until
 
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
2023 um but I understand your point
 
01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
represent LE yeah I agree with you I
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
mean I I I certainly hope i' like to
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
believe that we'll be done with it uh by
 
01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
the end of the summer end of the year um
 
01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:24.229 align:start position:0%
the end of the summer end of the year um
but

01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
you know that may not be the case so I'd
 
01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
be okay I mean I wouldn't object
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
massively or limiting it to the end of
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
2022 but I don't have a problem letting
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
it go through 2023 either unless there's
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
a reason other than just to keep the
 
01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
statues clean I would prefer to leave it
 
01:21:43.229 --> 01:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
to 2023 just so we don't have to revisit
 
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
it again if there's an issue and if
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
everything works out and it's all clear
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to probably not utilize It
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
Anyway representative
 
01:21:53.229 --> 01:21:53.239 align:start position:0%
gr thank you
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
s here in my notes Margaret um burn did
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
say that um although it does recognize
 
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
local control she felt that more clearer
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
language was needed so I'm going to
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
follow up with her on that unless we oh
 
01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
I believe she's still here uh Miss Burns
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
could you uh would you be willing to
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
chime in on this yes of course um yes
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
that that is what I uh discussed at the
 
01:22:21.149 --> 01:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
hearing that the understanding has been
 
01:22:23.950 --> 01:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
under this language in the governor's
 
01:22:27.229 --> 01:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
emergency order that clearly local rules
 
01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
and regulations do apply and that this
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
language was meant to deal with the
 
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
state level licensing allowing for the
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
outdoor expansion under that statutory
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
scheme but that all normal local rules
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
that would apply to you know building
 
01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
out or making changes in a you know a
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
site or building out into the road or
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
unshared property in a parking lot all
 
01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
of those normal rules would apply and so
 
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
my suggestion had been just a few words
 
01:22:59.310 --> 01:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
clearly saying that you know local rules
 
01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
and regulations still apply to the
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
expansion of outdoor dining and I do
 
01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
after the hearing I did speak with
 
01:23:10.030 --> 01:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
Darren winham who is um in the planning
 
01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
director and Community Development
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
director over in exiter he is the one
 
01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
who actually drafted this language for
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
the emergency order and I do believe he
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
is here with us on the call this morning
 
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
so if the committee would would like to
 
01:23:25.629 --> 01:23:25.639 align:start position:0%
hear a little bit of background from him
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
on why this was written and what it was
 
01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
meant to accomplish I believe he's here
 
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
with us this morning um he is and I have
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
promoted him uh Mr winam could you
 
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
please let us know your thoughts good
 
01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you very much um and
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Margaret uh yeah uh I wrote
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
the legislation but it was with the
 
01:23:43.950 --> 01:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
assistance of Mike Summers from the L
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
and Warren Daniels from the spdc and
 
01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
other a lot of other restaurants uh that
 
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
are worried and to just to address a
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
couple of the issues um the first one is
 
01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
to The Reason we put it through 2023 and
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
we originally wrote it through 2022 was
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that uh these
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
restaurants are hurting so much and we
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
want to give them the confidence that
 
01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
they can actually you know have outdoor
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
dining for long enough that they are
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
willing to make investments and you know
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh just be as healthy as they possibly
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
can be um addressing the environmental
 
01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
issues uh Margaret's absolutely right
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
the way the legislation's written as I
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
understand it is that um you know we
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
have complete control over that the
 
01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
towns have control over that now whether
 
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
that's on private property or on public
 
01:24:29.470 --> 01:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
property and it's actually written so
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
that if one has this is the liquor
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
portion of it if if a in order to serve
 
01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
uh liquor outdoors in areas that was not
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
already approved by Liquor Commission
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
they have to have the actual Liquor
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
Commission license so in other words if
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
a restaurant doesn't have a liquor
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
license or or for outdoor dining they
 
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
can't just get that anyway and the last
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
piece is is the way most towns do this
 
01:24:55.229 --> 01:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
the town of course has to approve it as
 
01:24:57.550 --> 01:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
you understand but then most processes
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
are like ours there's about six of his
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
towns that got together and sort of
 
01:25:03.109 --> 01:25:03.119 align:start position:0%
wrote the drafts for it and that means
 
01:25:07.709 --> 01:25:07.719 align:start position:0%
one applies to the town the uh the fire
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
police yeah fire police planning DPW
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
Health everybody has to sign off on it
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
and then they get the final signature we
 
01:25:17.149 --> 01:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
require a million doar of uh
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
additionally insured if they're on our
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
property uh and um and that's about it
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
but it's a very puton down process we
 
01:25:25.109 --> 01:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
require a sketch and all the department
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
heads to go see the space and everything
 
01:25:29.070 --> 01:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
so um very much appreciate you guys
 
01:25:30.189 --> 01:25:30.199 align:start position:0%
taking this into consideration you're
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
going to help a lot of people a lot of
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
workers by doing it thank you um does
 
01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
anyone else in the committee have any
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts or questions um I I think I
 
01:25:44.189 --> 01:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
like this the way it is it um it leaves
 
01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
local control but at the state level
 
01:25:48.629 --> 01:25:48.639 align:start position:0%
takes gets rid of barriers that are in
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
the way for the restaurants
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative Shu thank you Mr Mr chair
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
I was curious uh Rob T if from Dees had
 
01:26:00.109 --> 01:26:00.119 align:start position:0%
testified during the original hearing
 
01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
and de's concern was um lack
 
01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:09.719 align:start position:0%
of how shall I say rest facilities to
 
01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
accommodate possibly um more clientele
 
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
I'm curious if Mr tardiff someone from
 
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
Dees is
 
01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
present um I believe we we just stress
 
01:26:23.950 --> 01:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
that at the beginning because their
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
occupancy limitations would still apply
 
01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
so whether they have 100 people inside
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
or 100 people outside their septic
 
01:26:32.109 --> 01:26:32.119 align:start position:0%
should be designed for their their
 
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
occupancy limits this doesn't wave their
 
01:26:36.189 --> 01:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
occupancy limits so that should not put
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
an additional strain on there but
 
01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
representative gold thank you Mr chair I
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
I think I'd like to hear a little more
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
on that because I think occupancy deals
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
with the inside occupancy when you get
 
01:26:49.149 --> 01:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
your certificate of occupancy and when
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
you expand Outdoors that uh number can
 
01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
be increased because of the square
 
01:26:57.070 --> 01:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
footage of area You're Now using um but
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
I would like clarification on that
 
01:27:00.990 --> 01:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
whether I'm right correct or not Mr
 
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
cardish you're uh able to unmute
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
scen okay I'm sorry about that I think
 
01:27:16.270 --> 01:27:16.280 align:start position:0%
am I uh I in all right go ahead all
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
right thank you uh thank you Mr chair
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee uh again my
 
01:27:21.870 --> 01:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
name is Rob tarff I'm the administrator
 
01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:24.280 align:start position:0%
of this subsurface systems program in
 
01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
01:27:28.830 --> 01:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
uh in general we deal with on-site
 
01:27:31.229 --> 01:27:31.239 align:start position:0%
Wastewater or septic systems uh we deal
 
01:27:33.229 --> 01:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
with other things but relative to this
 
01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
conversation I just want to preface what
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say with we only deal with
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
those in this case those restaurants
 
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
that are on septic systems versus those
 
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
restaurants that are on Municipal sewer
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
for instance so anybody that's on a
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
municipal sewer we have no Authority or
 
01:27:53.149 --> 01:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
or any input on that
 
01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
um what our concern is is a lot of these
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
properties that the you know that these
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
restaurants are located on have been uh
 
01:28:03.629 --> 01:28:03.639 align:start position:0%
the number of seats have been maximized
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
to what the lot can support and sewage
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
load uh it's a relatively simple formula
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
I mean it takes into account uh
 
01:28:14.669 --> 01:28:14.679 align:start position:0%
different site Char characteristics
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
whether it be Wetlands uh an on-site
 
01:28:19.390 --> 01:28:19.400 align:start position:0%
well radius has to be deducted from this
 
01:28:21.790 --> 01:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
particular formula you plug all this
 
01:28:24.149 --> 01:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
information in and this formula will
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
essentially tell you how many gallons
 
01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
per day a lot can support in sewage load
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
and the way we regulate restaurants is
 
01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
on a per seat basis so you know an
 
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
approval issued by the bureau may be for
 
01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
a 50- seat restaurant because that's all
 
01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
that that lot can support so our concern
 
01:28:46.590 --> 01:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
is to just allow for additional
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
seating uh you may get into a scenario
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
where the lot can no longer buy this
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
formula support that sewage
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
load uh the other concerns we have is is
 
01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
the existing system is designed based on
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
a particular sewage load and if what I'm
 
01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
hearing may not this may not apply but
 
01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
let me I'll just finish my thought here
 
01:29:11.669 --> 01:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh if you add seats you know if you have
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
a 100 indoor seats or 50 indoor seats
 
01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:17.719 align:start position:0%
and you want to add 25 additional seats
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
Outdoors now that that system is no
 
01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
longer built uh to accommodate for that
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
additional load the you know it's not
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
just the leech field that we're
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
concerned with we're concerned with the
 
01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
septic tank not being able to separate
 
01:29:33.709 --> 01:29:33.719 align:start position:0%
the the sewage as it's designed to do in
 
01:29:35.109 --> 01:29:35.119 align:start position:0%
addition to the septic tank there are
 
01:29:37.709 --> 01:29:37.719 align:start position:0%
also grease traps and these grease traps
 
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
are designed at a particular volume to
 
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
address certain grease loads again you
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
you start accommodating for additional
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
seating all of that sewage load in
 
01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
grease and everything else is increased
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
and it could be increased to a point
 
01:29:54.189 --> 01:29:54.199 align:start position:0%
where it
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
could it could cause premature failure
 
01:29:57.709 --> 01:29:57.719 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:30:01.149 --> 01:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
system um and another concern we have is
 
01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:03.400 align:start position:0%
it's it may be one thing for a
 
01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
standalone restaurant you know I own you
 
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
know Rob tff's restaurant on my own
 
01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
piece of property and if if I add
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
additional seating and I fail my system
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
then it's kind of on me to address that
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
that situation a lot of these well there
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
are a number of these restaurants that
 
01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
are in you know somewhat of a a
 
01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
condominium a commercial condominium
 
01:30:29.709 --> 01:30:29.719 align:start position:0%
type scenario where somebody may be the
 
01:30:31.550 --> 01:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
owner of this commercial condominium one
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
of his or her tenants is a restaurant so
 
01:30:37.629 --> 01:30:37.639 align:start position:0%
now that system which is designed to
 
01:30:39.790 --> 01:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
accomodate for a number potentially a
 
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
number of different types of storefronts
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
including a
 
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
restaurant that restaurant may now be
 
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to increase that sewage load
 
01:30:50.709 --> 01:30:50.719 align:start position:0%
which could detrimentally affect the
 
01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
system for the entire
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
commercial condominium
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
complex um you know we're we're
 
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
concerned with you know who who you know
 
01:31:03.629 --> 01:31:03.639 align:start position:0%
the logistics of how this is going to
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
happen you know what state department is
 
01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
going to be uh delegated I guess to keep
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
track of these seats and if if and when
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
this gets sunsetted how are those seats
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
then going to be removed if they're
 
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:31:21.390 --> 01:31:21.400 align:start position:0%
removed uh we have existing compliance
 
01:31:25.229 --> 01:31:25.239 align:start position:0%
at I can I I can stop at any time we we
 
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
I don't want to take up too much of your
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
time one one last thing if I could is we
 
01:31:32.830 --> 01:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
have existing compliance cases regarding
 
01:31:35.149 --> 01:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
expansion of restaurants and what would
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
happen to those existing compliance
 
01:31:40.189 --> 01:31:40.199 align:start position:0%
cases would that would those compliance
 
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
cases then be you know removed from the
 
01:31:47.149 --> 01:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
from concern so anyway uh again I don't
 
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
want to go on and on but uh the
 
01:31:51.189 --> 01:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
department does have some concerns that
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
that maybe should be discussed within
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you uh just briefly
 
01:32:00.030 --> 01:32:00.040 align:start position:0%
if if a restaurant has a seating
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
capacity and we're talking about indoor
 
01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
seating that seating capacity would be
 
01:32:08.590 --> 01:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
matched to the uh existing sewage system
 
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct so if this bill
 
01:32:14.109 --> 01:32:14.119 align:start position:0%
were to limit the outdoor seating and
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
indoor seating combined to what the
 
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
indoor seating would be would that
 
01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
alleviate the problem we would have no
 
01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
issue whatsoever we are under the
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
impression that this was going to allow
 
01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:25.400 align:start position:0%
for additional seating as a matter of
 
01:32:27.870 --> 01:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
fact we if and I'll be brief again but
 
01:32:29.709 --> 01:32:29.719 align:start position:0%
we have worked with restaurants and we
 
01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
work very closely with food service
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
licensing and health and human services
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
and we have said to people absolutely
 
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
bring your seats outside but you would
 
01:32:40.830 --> 01:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
have to somehow cordon off those indoor
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
seats as to not increase the sewage load
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
as a result of bringing seats outside if
 
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
if the number of seats don't increase
 
01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
the subsurface system Bureau has no
 
01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
concerns thank representative Le right I
 
01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
that's what I was going to suggest
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
except it should say they can't have any
 
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
more seats than uh currently permitted
 
01:33:04.510 --> 01:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
for indoor and any pre-existing outdoor
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
dining because some restaurants have
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
been able have had both but they may
 
01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
have expanded the outdoor but I mean an
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
amendment like that seems like we'll
 
01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
um we lost oh U Mr winam
 
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
please hi thank you very much I
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate what Mr tardiff was
 
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
saying and I I frankly agree with it
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
could you possibly uh have it written
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
such that and I would love to have Mr
 
01:33:33.109 --> 01:33:33.119 align:start position:0%
tardi way if it's okay have it be that
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
if it's on AC seed system the way you're
 
01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
proposing it makes a lot of sense uh
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
whatever the maximum seats are indoor
 
01:33:40.510 --> 01:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
and out would be the maximum seats
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
forever we going ahead till 2023 and
 
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
then if it's on Municipal sewer since
 
01:33:46.830 --> 01:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
it's under Municipal control we could
 
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
allow them the extra seats um that it
 
01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
could be accommodated
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
so that suggestion sounds sounds right
 
01:33:56.669 --> 01:33:56.679 align:start position:0%
to you that we just limit it to the
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
number of combined seats what the indoor
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
seating would be if you're if you're on
 
01:34:03.790 --> 01:34:03.800 align:start position:0%
septic but if it's on Municipal then
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
allow more seating if that's if it's if
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
the town allows it because you're that's
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
going to be by Zone and by
 
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.350 align:start position:0%
going to be by Zone and by
yeah

01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:17.470 --> 01:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
gr right um I want to be sure that one
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
of the things that's um important about
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation is it does allow for
 
01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
local control which is something that I
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
want to maintain so um if we put the
 
01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:31.830 align:start position:0%
want to maintain so um if we put the
legislation

01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering
 
01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
if I I agree with what Mr Charter is
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
saying that the total number for those
 
01:34:45.109 --> 01:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
um restaurants who are on septic has to
 
01:34:47.629 --> 01:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
remain the same as if the indoor
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
capacity has to equal the indoor and
 
01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
outdoor capacity
 
01:34:56.189 --> 01:34:56.199 align:start position:0%
um and for those systems that are on
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
sewer local we need I think we should
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
say that local um ordinances local
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
whatever it is local law applies we I
 
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
think we need to say that for both so
 
01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
that people who are on on sewer
 
01:35:16.109 --> 01:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
systems understand that they themselves
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
have to follow local rules as well does
 
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
that make sense it it does and um Mr
 
01:35:25.229 --> 01:35:25.239 align:start position:0%
winham is that not already contemplated
 
01:35:26.910 --> 01:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
in the bill that at the end of the day
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
the local
 
01:35:31.709 --> 01:35:31.719 align:start position:0%
Authority it it is Sir but uh I think
 
01:35:33.550 --> 01:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
what Margaret and what representative
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
Gro is saying is that it needs to be I
 
01:35:37.709 --> 01:35:37.719 align:start position:0%
think more articulated better when I
 
01:35:39.709 --> 01:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
wrote it I don't think I I wrote it as
 
01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
well as frankly it could have been okay
 
01:35:44.189 --> 01:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
representative Gord would you uh be
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
willing to get us some language that
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
that would fulfill that what you yeah if
 
01:35:55.149 --> 01:35:55.159 align:start position:0%
a Mr if Miss is um Burns and Mr Windam
 
01:35:57.390 --> 01:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
and Mr tff will assist me I'll be sure
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
to get that to you and then we want to
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
um so we want to put it so the Max
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
Capacity then is the um is the uh indoor
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
capacity so if they go outside they
 
01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
can't exceed the numb as if they were
 
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
all inside does that make sense I've
 
01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
said this too many times I'm probably
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
I'll take care of it yep all right thank
 
01:36:20.229 --> 01:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
you uh representative um goalie did you
 
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh no I just I just want to point out
 
01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
that um it would be good to have local
 
01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
control um still in the mix of it
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
because it only states that if an
 
01:36:35.229 --> 01:36:35.239 align:start position:0%
expansion is in a shared space such as a
 
01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
sidewalker Street then the restaurant
 
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
shall be required to coordinate and seek
 
01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
approval from local authorities uh
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about parking areas
 
01:36:44.910 --> 01:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
and I think that's an important issue as
 
01:36:47.229 --> 01:36:47.239 align:start position:0%
well uh in local communities as you take
 
01:36:49.229 --> 01:36:49.239 align:start position:0%
away parking spaces and you increase
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
outdoor seating um that increases the
 
01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
number of cars coming in and those cars
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
have to park somewhere and if those
 
01:36:57.550 --> 01:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
spaces aren't there it can become a
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
problem on local streets um so I think
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
it is important that local communities
 
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
also have a say um in the expansion I I
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
think they should have the final say um
 
01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:09.380 align:start position:0%
think they should have the final say um
Mr

01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:09.390 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:10.910 align:start position:0%
Mr
[Music]

01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:37:13.629 --> 01:37:13.639 align:start position:0%
tar I just wanted to quickly add that uh
 
01:37:15.310 --> 01:37:15.320 align:start position:0%
I would be more than willing and happy
 
01:37:17.709 --> 01:37:17.719 align:start position:0%
to to help write any additional language
 
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
to this I just want you to know that I'm
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
on vacation for a week I'll be back next
 
01:37:24.270 --> 01:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
Thursday I'm leaving tomorrow but I'll
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
be back next Thursday and again I'd be
 
01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
happy to help I appreciate the offer um
 
01:37:30.030 --> 01:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
representative GTO you might want to
 
01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
take advantage of him today if you could
 
01:37:33.629 --> 01:37:33.639 align:start position:0%
because I don't think we'll be holding
 
01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
on to this that long that's right all
 
01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
right is anyone else have anything to
 
01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
say on this we're all okay with it if we
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
fix the um the septic issue and the
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
issue and that
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
just I want to recap before we move on
 
01:37:58.430 --> 01:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
to the amendment so the first section
 
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
um want a definition of
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
temporary everyone said that we would be
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:09.109 align:start position:0%
 
correct

01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:19.070 align:start position:0%
 
twoy

01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
licensing where did we end with that
 
01:38:22.910 --> 01:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
talking about putting something in about
 
01:38:25.950 --> 01:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
it being up to the medical board yeah we
 
01:38:28.109 --> 01:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
didn't really clearly um complete that
 
01:38:30.109 --> 01:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
but I think that we wanted a definition
 
01:38:30.119 --> 01:38:31.830 align:start position:0%
but I think that we wanted a definition
of

01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
emergency and there was some discussion
 
01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
of it
 
01:38:38.669 --> 01:38:38.679 align:start position:0%
being the declared state of emergency
 
01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
but also allowing for a local emergency
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
for lack of medical professionals as
 
01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
defined by the medical board if they
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
were to make application to them and if
 
01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
I recall representative goie wasn't
 
01:38:55.709 --> 01:38:55.719 align:start position:0%
exactly thrilled with that
 
01:38:58.229 --> 01:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
idea any other
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
thoughts chair yes represent didn't um
 
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
if memory serves and it's got been a
 
01:39:08.430 --> 01:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
while now didn't representative Pierce
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
say that his committee was uh grappling
 
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:15.350 align:start position:0%
with this
subject

01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
subject
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
yes I'm wondering if there's some way
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
that we could um defer this section to
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
his committee
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
which probably has more expertise
 
01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
do um I'd have to look actually one of
 
01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
the things is
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
section which section section
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
two okay
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
section sunsets then just do it Mr chair
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
if I may
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
yes um my my my concerns are um
 
01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:53.320 align:start position:0%
alleviated s this is going to sunset
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
January 31st 2022 this is just temporary
 
01:40:00.109 --> 01:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
and uh as long as it sunsets on the 3
 
01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
January 31st 2022 I'm all set the way
 
01:40:04.669 --> 01:40:04.679 align:start position:0%
it's written okay so we'll just leave it
 
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
alone and if they need to if they want
 
01:40:07.870 --> 01:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
to address it further they can take it
 
01:40:09.149 --> 01:40:09.159 align:start position:0%
up in health and human services and
 
01:40:09.159 --> 01:40:10.070 align:start position:0%
up in health and human services and
another

01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
statue um all right so section two we're
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:21.310 --> 01:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
three promises and pharmacies um I think
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
we all agreed that that was fine yeah
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
and I think that's another one where if
 
01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
it needs to be expanded be between
 
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
Beyond just Co Mo that to the other
 
01:40:31.390 --> 01:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
committee we're only going to deal with
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
stuff that's that sunsets and that Co
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
covers everything else should
 
01:40:38.229 --> 01:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
appropriately go the right statute uh
 
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
section four is the same thing I'm not
 
01:40:42.750 --> 01:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
sure if that does that sunsets problem
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
is it's hard of some of these sunset
 
01:40:48.270 --> 01:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
sunset based on Y and some kind of do
 
01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:52.199 align:start position:0%
themselves four was testing we agreed
 
01:40:54.270 --> 01:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
that was fine and it talks about
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
covid-19 so it sunsets section five was
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
um vaccinations yeah and we decided to
 
01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
leave that alone with covid and anything
 
01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
else if they want they can do in new
 
01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:07.390 align:start position:0%
else if they want they can do in new
legislation

01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
yeah six sunsets as well six sunsets as
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:16.629 align:start position:0%
 
state

01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
seven is summer camps we agreed that
 
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
that's fine yeah
 
01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:24.390 align:start position:0%
that's fine yeah
eight

01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
eight
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
construction we were talking about
 
01:41:28.109 --> 01:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
removing that we're gonna we were
 
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
talking about removing this section Mr
 
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
chair yes go ahead Mr represent B just a
 
01:41:36.189 --> 01:41:36.199 align:start position:0%
quick one on the summer camps can we
 
01:41:38.109 --> 01:41:38.119 align:start position:0%
look into whether should sunset or not
 
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
that was the other discussion we had on
 
01:41:42.910 --> 01:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
that one that's the only one yeah I mean
 
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's sort of it's limited duration
 
01:41:48.030 --> 01:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
but it would still stay in statute if it
 
01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't Sunset so yeah that' be good to
 
01:41:52.709 --> 01:41:52.719 align:start position:0%
do sunset for that and then we all agree
 
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:41:57.629 --> 01:41:57.639 align:start position:0%
correct all right section eight um the
 
01:41:59.589 --> 01:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
construction one we I believe we discuss
 
01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
removing this oh what go ahead one one
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
other on the summer camps um I think the
 
01:42:07.270 --> 01:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
somebody we ended up talking about this
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh adding 2020 if they were closed 2020
 
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.470 align:start position:0%
uh adding 2020 if they were closed 2020
or

01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
2021 um due to co I mean I'm hoping
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's not going to happen next summer
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
but there was talk about you know
 
01:42:27.149 --> 01:42:27.159 align:start position:0%
including 2021 just in case sum well
 
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
actually wait a minute I if if they were
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
closed because of covid last summer and
 
01:42:35.070 --> 01:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
we could add this summer just in
 
01:42:37.629 --> 01:42:37.639 align:start position:0%
case but it says covid-19 so it would
 
01:42:40.750 --> 01:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
have to be because of covid-19 yeah if
 
01:42:42.189 --> 01:42:42.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to amend it anyway I would
 
01:42:44.709 --> 01:42:44.719 align:start position:0%
suggest doing that just add year just in
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
case yeah the summer of 2020 or2 this
 
01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to add AET for it like you
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
said gested representative goalie but
 
01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to also include 2021 in case
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
the summer camp can't open this year
 
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
because of CO as
 
01:43:01.470 --> 01:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
well I'm fine with that else seem okay
 
01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:02.189 align:start position:0%
well I'm fine with that else seem okay
all

01:43:02.189 --> 01:43:02.199 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
right section eight we um heard and
 
01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
agreed that this is no longer necessary
 
01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
no one's here from the construction
 
01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:11.320 align:start position:0%
industry to cter that so we're going to
 
01:43:13.629 --> 01:43:13.639 align:start position:0%
everyone agreed to strike this
 
01:43:13.639 --> 01:43:15.990 align:start position:0%
everyone agreed to strike this
portion

01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
portion
 
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
okay and unfor which is good so then
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
that things on section nine
 
01:43:21.390 --> 01:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
representative gr you're going to get
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
some language and we all agree that the
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
language will um limit the capacity for
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
the source systems to the indoor total
 
01:43:32.589 --> 01:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I have a
 
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
question um so when you say if
 
01:43:37.310 --> 01:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
everyone's okay with that is that our
 
01:43:41.149 --> 01:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
version of a vote right now um no I'm
 
01:43:42.830 --> 01:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
just trying to make sure there's
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
no okay sorry I'm actually a place where
 
01:43:49.709 --> 01:43:49.719 align:start position:0%
it's not always easy to hear but I just
 
01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure I didn't miss a vote
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
no just really we're just trying to make
 
01:43:54.910 --> 01:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
sure there's no more work to be done
 
01:43:57.070 --> 01:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
before we voted out of the subcommittee
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
and if you have a issue with anything
 
01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
speak now
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
please um and so we agreed on the
 
01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
language and
 
01:44:09.149 --> 01:44:09.159 align:start position:0%
nine which I guess so we're all set on
 
01:44:09.159 --> 01:44:10.910 align:start position:0%
nine which I guess so we're all set on
that

01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
um so I guess have to take a vote Mr
 
01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
chair yes just a quick question um just
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
a reminder for repres resentative groa
 
01:44:24.510 --> 01:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
when she works on the uh Amendment for
 
01:44:27.709 --> 01:44:27.719 align:start position:0%
outdoor dining I think we had agreed
 
01:44:31.629 --> 01:44:31.639 align:start position:0%
that the um repeal date on that should
 
01:44:34.669 --> 01:44:34.679 align:start position:0%
be moved up also should she include that
 
01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:36.630 align:start position:0%
in her uh proposed
 
01:44:36.630 --> 01:44:39.310 align:start position:0%
in her uh proposed
[Music]

01:44:39.310 --> 01:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:44:41.790 --> 01:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
amendment there was
 
01:44:45.589 --> 01:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
discussion um some people wanted it
 
01:44:47.950 --> 01:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
moved up and some left through next year
 
01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
just in case yeah I think we were G to
 
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
leave that through next year just in
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
case to get we heard from testimony that
 
01:44:56.669 --> 01:44:56.679 align:start position:0%
uh it would add some shity to the
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
restaurants as far as planning and and
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
and things that they knew for sure
 
01:45:01.589 --> 01:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to continue this
 
01:45:03.229 --> 01:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
regardless of what happens for one more
 
01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
year right well it currently if I'm
 
01:45:09.550 --> 01:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
correct that uh is referred to as
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
December of
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
2023 so the suggestion was made make it
 
01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
December of
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
2022 right but we agreed that well was
 
01:45:22.589 --> 01:45:22.599 align:start position:0%
recommended that we leave it the way it
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
is for
 
01:45:26.589 --> 01:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
2023 yeah um just so that the
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
restaurants would have um whether or not
 
01:45:31.390 --> 01:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
they have to utilize it it lets them
 
01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
plan and know that they're going to be
 
01:45:35.070 --> 01:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
able to use this if they have to
 
01:45:39.070 --> 01:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:42.030 --> 01:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair I I'm still
 
01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
just have concerns going that far
 
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
forward we're giving them 2021 all of
 
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
next year 2022 and then we're looking to
 
01:45:50.189 --> 01:45:50.199 align:start position:0%
this adds on that third year because
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
this does end until December 2023 that's
 
01:45:57.030 --> 01:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
three Summers out I think two summers is
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
good if we need to expand beyond that we
 
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
have the ability to um as needed that
 
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
was my only concern I mean this is
 
01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
going Way Beyond I believe is needed I'm
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
I believe that uh once the restaurants
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
have this ability
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
approved uh that they're going to look
 
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
at having this outdoor uh dining
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
possibility like every
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
summer which may be a good thing
 
01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
um bill um so does anyone have an issue
 
01:46:35.950 --> 01:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
if we bring it to December 2022 no I'm
 
01:46:38.910 --> 01:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
okay with that and if it looks like in
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
the fall of 2022 that some Amendment
 
01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
will be necessary to extend it like
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative Bry said we have plenty
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
of time to do
 
01:46:49.629 --> 01:46:49.639 align:start position:0%
that okay can you get that represent BR
 
01:46:52.189 --> 01:46:52.199 align:start position:0%
just amend change the uh Sunset to
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
December 2022 versus December
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
2023 December 2022 we'll do okay so as
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
far as
 
01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
um the process here I know certain
 
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
people are taking on certain parts of it
 
01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
are you looking for someone to do other
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
parts of it or what's the process I
 
01:47:17.070 --> 01:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
think we've got everything except for
 
01:47:19.149 --> 01:47:19.159 align:start position:0%
well I need someone could take on the
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
definition of portion want to do that
 
01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
for oh for temporary yeah I won't do
 
01:47:26.750 --> 01:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to get rid of it um but if
 
01:47:28.510 --> 01:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
you need somebody to take on the summer
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
that all right um we're not going to
 
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
vote on this until we have the the
 
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
Amendments um so I'm going to see if I
 
01:47:40.109 --> 01:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
can get us another subcommittee meeting
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
shortly because I can't how can we vote
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
on it without the uh language change I
 
01:47:46.830 --> 01:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
mean unless we di ational vote based on
 
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
what we all agreed to represent goalie
 
01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:50.970 align:start position:0%
we going to say something I saw you
 
01:47:50.970 --> 01:47:52.589 align:start position:0%
we going to say something I saw you
[Music]

01:47:52.589 --> 01:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:47:56.109 --> 01:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
I just was wondering um and this might
 
01:47:59.629 --> 01:47:59.639 align:start position:0%
be a question for Pam I I think as each
 
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
of your subcommittee members are working
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
on amendments to certain sections um is
 
01:48:06.550 --> 01:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
a good thing but I think we will need a
 
01:48:08.589 --> 01:48:08.599 align:start position:0%
full final amendment to amend the whole
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
bill after we get those initial
 
01:48:13.149 --> 01:48:13.159 align:start position:0%
subsection amendments done and I just
 
01:48:15.629 --> 01:48:15.639 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that the committee is
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
aware of that as well maybe we can send
 
01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
these to um m
 
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
to compile together so we'll have one
 
01:48:26.030 --> 01:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
amendment to change the bill AB
 
01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely I was going to chime in also
 
01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:33.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you um I um would be
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
happy to you know compile and and look
 
01:48:38.589 --> 01:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
into the the definition of temporary
 
01:48:41.589 --> 01:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
health um partner in other states and
 
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
and see if I can find some kind of
 
01:48:45.310 --> 01:48:45.320 align:start position:0%
definition that will be helpful but in
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
the meantime as you um you know work on
 
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
your various pieces if if everybody
 
01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
would be sure to send them to me that
 
01:48:55.550 --> 01:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
would that would be
 
01:48:58.189 --> 01:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
great F question on process from this
 
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
smling so should we send a request for
 
01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
amendments to OSS and then you'll merge
 
01:49:07.870 --> 01:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
them all together or just send you
 
01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:08.750 align:start position:0%
them all together or just send you
something

01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:49:11.709 --> 01:49:11.719 align:start position:0%
indicating the changes and what we think
 
01:49:14.510 --> 01:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
the language maybe should be I I think
 
01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
it's easier if if we just go to OS once
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
if possible so if you just send me your
 
01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
your sort of informal language um you
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
know clear but but but not necessarily
 
01:49:30.189 --> 01:49:30.199 align:start position:0%
OS drafted then I can compile it and
 
01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
send it to them and then review what
 
01:49:34.669 --> 01:49:34.679 align:start position:0%
they send back to make sure everything's
 
01:49:36.910 --> 01:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
been Incorporated and I think that's
 
01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:40.360 align:start position:0%
easier um in the long run okay I think
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
we got it so um also if Miss Mary if you
 
01:49:45.709 --> 01:49:45.719 align:start position:0%
could I'll be the one um handling the
 
01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
the definition of temporary so if you
 
01:49:49.629 --> 01:49:49.639 align:start position:0%
could get me what you find out on that
 
01:49:49.639 --> 01:49:51.189 align:start position:0%
could get me what you find out on that
sure

01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:49:53.709 --> 01:49:53.719 align:start position:0%
sure um representative Schmidt you have
 
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%

01:49:58.589 --> 01:49:58.599 align:start position:0%

congratulations on that uh and well-run
 
01:50:10.510 --> 01:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
meeting uh but the proposed amendment of
 
01:50:12.430 --> 01:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
course is still hanging out
 
01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%
there obviously it doesn't go anywhere
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh then uh then then the the process
 
01:50:21.790 --> 01:50:21.800 align:start position:0%
you've laid out will will wind
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
everything up
 
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:26.000 align:start position:0%

01:50:27.709 --> 01:50:27.719 align:start position:0%
where we go with the amendment or you go

has anything to say about this who wants
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
to start if he's still there I think
 
01:51:38.550 --> 01:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative Baxter was gonna say
 
01:51:40.510 --> 01:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
something about his
 
01:51:44.069 --> 01:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
amendment I don't know if he's still
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:52.390 align:start position:0%
 
now

01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:52.400 align:start position:0%

so thank you representative Roy um I am
 
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:02.360 align:start position:0%
still here and I really did enjoy that
 
01:52:04.589 --> 01:52:04.599 align:start position:0%
conversation about s SP
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
155 um I may want to answer some
 
01:52:10.669 --> 01:52:10.679 align:start position:0%
questions as they pop up by members on
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
the committee but I did um revise the
 
01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
amendment slightly and the biggest
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
change is the exemption provision um I
 
01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
really took um the feedback seriously
 
01:52:25.950 --> 01:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
from the um the last um time when people
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
were testifying and the exemption
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
provision was probably the area where we
 
01:52:33.069 --> 01:52:33.079 align:start position:0%
received the most constructive criticism
 
01:52:35.790 --> 01:52:35.800 align:start position:0%
so that section's been broadened to deal
 
01:52:38.189 --> 01:52:38.199 align:start position:0%
with just really medical facilities as a
 
01:52:41.629 --> 01:52:41.639 align:start position:0%
whole um for an example um we saw
 
01:52:44.189 --> 01:52:44.199 align:start position:0%
someone from a nursing home that talked
 
01:52:47.229 --> 01:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
about we don't force our employees to
 
01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
get the vaccine but we need to know who
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
has the VAC vacine so we can make proper
 
01:52:53.629 --> 01:52:53.639 align:start position:0%
decisions for the people we're serving
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
and I thought that was a very legitimate
 
01:52:58.750 --> 01:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
criticism so we've taken uh that
 
01:53:01.750 --> 01:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
feedback and changed the amendment um so
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
now that exemption provision is broader
 
01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
um the substance of the amendment
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
overall is still the same um it's still
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
a bill that's making sure that um the
 
01:53:14.189 --> 01:53:14.199 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire or businesses
 
01:53:17.229 --> 01:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
that receive taxpayer funds Don't Force
 
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
employees or their customers to get a
 
01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:20.669 align:start position:0%
employees or their customers to get a
vac

01:53:20.669 --> 01:53:20.679 align:start position:0%
vac
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
or to or to require a vaccine passport
 
01:53:26.069 --> 01:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
and if they don't do that then they
 
01:53:28.109 --> 01:53:28.119 align:start position:0%
could possibly be discriminated against
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
so the substance of the bill is the same
 
01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
and if anyone has any questions I'm
 
01:53:35.629 --> 01:53:35.639 align:start position:0%
happy to answer anything right
 
01:53:37.990 --> 01:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
now anyone have any questions for
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
representative Baxter or wishing to
 
01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
comment on the
 
01:53:47.470 --> 01:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.550 --> 01:53:51.560 align:start position:0%
BR how do um Public Schools fit into
 
01:53:54.750 --> 01:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment representative
 
01:53:56.830 --> 01:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
bter thank you for your question
 
01:53:59.669 --> 01:53:59.679 align:start position:0%
representative so Public Schools um
 
01:54:01.950 --> 01:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
because they are subdivisions of the
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
government they fall under that um so
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
UNH for example this was asked um last
 
01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
time they would not be able to require a
 
01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine to their students or require a
 
01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:18.390 align:start position:0%
vaccine to their students or require a
vaccine

01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:21.629 --> 01:54:21.639 align:start position:0%
passport Jo all repres
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
Gord no and I will tell you that I will
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
not support this
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
amendment I also will not be supporting
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment well it's nice to see
 
01:54:33.390 --> 01:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
everyone is so open-minded that we can't
 
01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
even have the
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
discussion I I do believe that schools
 
01:54:40.189 --> 01:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
are important component of this and I'm
 
01:54:42.589 --> 01:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
sorry if this appears to be close-minded
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
but it is a very important point to me
 
01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
and I am offended by that comment
 
01:54:47.679 --> 01:54:48.669 align:start position:0%
and I am offended by that comment
representative

01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:54:53.550 --> 01:54:53.560 align:start position:0%
shu thank you Mr chair um I've had some
 
01:54:57.149 --> 01:54:57.159 align:start position:0%
conversation with constituents in my two
 
01:55:01.629 --> 01:55:01.639 align:start position:0%
towns and the consensus seems to be that
 
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh they don't feel that it should be
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
mandated that people show evidence of
 
01:55:12.109 --> 01:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
vaccine but they also do not feel that
 
01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
it should be totally banned uh I think
 
01:55:18.149 --> 01:55:18.159 align:start position:0%
my personal feeling is we should just
 
01:55:20.990 --> 01:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
leave it alone
 
01:55:24.069 --> 01:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
leave it up to businesses or entities uh
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
what they feel they need to make their
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
employees or clients
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
safe thank you representative leus thank
 
01:55:34.830 --> 01:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
you um yeah I've talked with other
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
people in our district and I the issue
 
01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
is by saying that people shouldn't have
 
01:55:41.910 --> 01:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
to have anation showing that they've
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated and they shouldn't be
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
forced to it the question is people say
 
01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
that what do they
 
01:55:51.470 --> 01:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
be um you know if a
 
01:55:55.109 --> 01:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
business wants to require um employees
 
01:55:56.270 --> 01:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:55:58.430 --> 01:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinated I mean does that mean they're
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
just going to ask them and they'll
 
01:56:02.830 --> 01:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
answer and and and take that at face
 
01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
value and if a business more doesn't
 
01:56:06.910 --> 01:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
want customers in who haven't been
 
01:56:09.550 --> 01:56:09.560 align:start position:0%
vaccinated you know if there isn't going
 
01:56:11.189 --> 01:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
to be any document showing you've been
 
01:56:14.589 --> 01:56:14.599 align:start position:0%
vaccinated what does that even mean um I
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
mean I'm I'm going to support this I
 
01:56:17.950 --> 01:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
would actually support it being a
 
01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
broader as has happened in uh some other
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
states that uh don't just limit it to
 
01:56:25.550 --> 01:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
businesses that take money from the
 
01:56:28.430 --> 01:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
state but it applies to all businesses
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
um but I mean I'll accept this as a an
 
01:56:34.510 --> 01:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
acceptable compromise but the key is if
 
01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to allow a business
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
to demand that their employees or their
 
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
customers be
 
01:56:45.310 --> 01:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
vaccinated I mean that doesn't mean much
 
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
unless people have to have some kind of
 
01:56:49.709 --> 01:56:49.719 align:start position:0%
documentation showing it it kind kind of
 
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
implies that you're going to have you
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
know a vaccine passport or something by
 
01:56:55.750 --> 01:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
another name that's really the same
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
thing which is prohibited right
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
so in a sense I mean you could argue
 
01:57:06.790 --> 01:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
that if uh you know that this actually
 
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
should apply to everything um but you
 
01:57:11.470 --> 01:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
know it is limited somewhat and I'll
 
01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:13.350 align:start position:0%
know it is limited somewhat and I'll
accept

01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
accept
 
01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:15.950 align:start position:0%
accept
that

01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:57:19.149 --> 01:57:19.159 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you uh I second
 
01:57:21.310 --> 01:57:21.320 align:start position:0%
what representative leus
 
01:57:23.790 --> 01:57:23.800 align:start position:0%
said look regardless of where you stand
 
01:57:26.589 --> 01:57:26.599 align:start position:0%
on this subject no matter what
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
persuasion political or otherwise that
 
01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
fits you um there's no denying that this
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
was a highly
 
01:57:36.510 --> 01:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
politicized circumstance we'll call it
 
01:57:39.550 --> 01:57:39.560 align:start position:0%
for the past year with that fact
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
established forcing individuals and it
 
01:57:44.830 --> 01:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
is forcing forcing them to have a
 
01:57:47.709 --> 01:57:47.719 align:start position:0%
bioactive compound injected into their
 
01:57:50.669 --> 01:57:50.679 align:start position:0%
flesh or face societal consequences and
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
that's what will happen it's an
 
01:57:55.109 --> 01:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
unbridled attack on our personal
 
01:57:57.910 --> 01:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
freedoms this is the most important
 
01:58:00.069 --> 01:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
tidbit of legislation that this
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
committee is going to consider all year
 
01:58:05.229 --> 01:58:05.239 align:start position:0%
and I could see it now you you can't
 
01:58:08.189 --> 01:58:08.199 align:start position:0%
have that job you you can't D in this
 
01:58:10.990 --> 01:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
establishment you you can't fly out of
 
01:58:13.950 --> 01:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
this airport you where are your papers
 
01:58:16.030 --> 01:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
so regardless of complications and I
 
01:58:17.310 --> 01:58:17.320 align:start position:0%
understand there are
 
01:58:19.069 --> 01:58:19.079 align:start position:0%
complications uh specifically in the
 
01:58:19.079 --> 01:58:19.830 align:start position:0%
complications uh specifically in the
medic

01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
medic
 
01:58:24.149 --> 01:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
field we can't provide the means to sort
 
01:58:26.830 --> 01:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
people like cattle so I support this
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
amendment and I support broading
 
01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:32.400 align:start position:0%

Maguire have the amendment but I am
 
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
actually hopping
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
in requests that considering how things
 
01:58:50.430 --> 01:58:50.440 align:start position:0%

representative Schultz I just want to
 
02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
say you know um first of all there is no
 
02:00:13.470 --> 02:00:13.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine passport that is a a word that
 
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
is loaded and nothing anyone is asking
 
02:00:21.390 --> 02:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
for on the second piece to expand requ
 
02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
you know disallowing requiring a
 
02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:27.109 align:start position:0%
you know disallowing requiring a
vaccine

02:00:27.109 --> 02:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we should be
 
02:00:33.870 --> 02:00:33.880 align:start position:0%
telling any
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:46.229 --> 02:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
should require it's iic because I
 
02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
believe it's un wedding cake uh you
 
02:00:56.069 --> 02:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
cannot tell a business Bakery they have
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to make a wedding cake for a
 
02:01:01.950 --> 02:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
same gender
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
couple um this would actually be the
 
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
same we
 
02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:10.310 align:start position:0%
same we
can't

02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
can't
 
02:01:12.790 --> 02:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
Telles Schulz you're coming in and out
 
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
I'm only getting like a quarter business
 
02:01:17.189 --> 02:01:17.199 align:start position:0%
or institutions as far as I understand
 
02:01:17.199 --> 02:01:18.030 align:start position:0%
or institutions as far as I understand
it

02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:01:20.310 --> 02:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
actually okay let me how about is it
 
02:01:22.510 --> 02:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
better this way it's just can you hear
 
02:01:24.430 --> 02:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
me better now yeah so far you haven't
 
02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
cut out again but I go ahead well just
 
02:01:30.109 --> 02:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
one more uh thing I wanted to say about
 
02:01:34.390 --> 02:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
it and that is it actually very well may
 
02:01:38.669 --> 02:01:38.679 align:start position:0%
hinder uh business because if it is a
 
02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:43.230 align:start position:0%
tourism related business that wants to
 
02:01:43.230 --> 02:01:44.510 align:start position:0%
tourism related business that wants to
[Music]

02:01:44.510 --> 02:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
en safety for those who have been
 
02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
reluctant to travel
 
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh the ability to require a vaccine say
 
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
if we were to have a port in Portsmouth
 
02:01:57.709 --> 02:01:57.719 align:start position:0%
for a cruise ship or buses from cruise
 
02:02:01.229 --> 02:02:01.239 align:start position:0%
ships or uh which does happen by the way
 
02:02:04.870 --> 02:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
from Boston and Portland or any other
 
02:02:10.030 --> 02:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:12.589 --> 02:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
that to ensure the safety of their
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
employee or our opinion is about the
 
02:02:17.550 --> 02:02:17.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine if a business has decided that's
 
02:02:19.109 --> 02:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
what they need for the safety of their
 
02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
employees and their customers that
 
02:02:23.430 --> 02:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be something ironically that
 
02:02:26.669 --> 02:02:26.679 align:start position:0%
we should want to uh do I just find it
 
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
ironic that our values about uh the free
 
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
market change when we have a personal
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
opinion over a vaccine or an illness
 
02:02:37.950 --> 02:02:37.960 align:start position:0%
which by the way none of us are Health
 
02:02:40.830 --> 02:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
Care uh providers to have an opinion on
 
02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:47.950 align:start position:0%
Care uh providers to have an opinion on
that

02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:50.629 align:start position:0%
 
but

02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:02:53.669 --> 02:02:53.679 align:start position:0%
right okay uh thank you representative
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%

02:02:57.790 --> 02:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
lost you again but I got your last
 
02:03:00.430 --> 02:03:00.440 align:start position:0%

o'clock we have to one Mr chair I will

it's fine
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
if there's no issue
 
02:03:26.189 --> 02:03:26.199 align:start position:0%
yeah break for lunch to
 
02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
one can I can I interject briefly Mr
 
02:03:32.669 --> 02:03:32.679 align:start position:0%
chairman just um before you all go I
 
02:03:34.350 --> 02:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
understand you're as I understand it
 
02:03:35.709 --> 02:03:35.719 align:start position:0%
you're talking about representative
 
02:03:37.270 --> 02:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
Baxter's Amendment
 
02:03:40.750 --> 02:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
1334 correct that's correct and I just
 
02:03:43.350 --> 02:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
want to point out that it it amends and
 
02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
I didn't maybe you talked about this and
 
02:03:47.069 --> 02:03:47.079 align:start position:0%
I I missed it but it amends section six
 
02:03:48.830 --> 02:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill relative to the farm
 
02:03:51.629 --> 02:03:51.639 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy language and also section nine
 
02:03:54.030 --> 02:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill on the expansion of outdoor
 
02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
dining and I just want to you know you
 
02:03:59.910 --> 02:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
to keep that that in mind as as further
 
02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
amendments um are discussed to either of
 
02:04:07.470 --> 02:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
those parts did that did did the does
 
02:04:11.830 --> 02:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
this amendment alter those yes yes it it
 
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
does so you know if we're thinking about
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
adopting it you know as 1334 we just
 
02:04:18.990 --> 02:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
need to remember that those sections
 
02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
appear and if you want to do something
 
02:04:22.629 --> 02:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
different with the expansion of outdoor
 
02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
dining potentially we need to get a new
 
02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
amendment that only addresses the
 
02:04:30.669 --> 02:04:30.679 align:start position:0%
vaccine anyway just just to keep it in
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
mind to keep it in play oh thank you and
 
02:04:34.830 --> 02:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you keeping just a process
 
02:04:38.669 --> 02:04:38.679 align:start position:0%
question I what I thought was that if we
 
02:04:42.549 --> 02:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
if the committee uh votes to adopt this
 
02:04:45.790 --> 02:04:45.800 align:start position:0%
as well as another amendment you know
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with various parts of SP 155
 
02:04:51.310 --> 02:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
that the end result would then be merged
 
02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
together in one Amendment just like
 
02:04:54.669 --> 02:04:54.679 align:start position:0%
we're doing for 133 and so there' really
 
02:04:56.990 --> 02:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
only be one amendment in the end is that
 
02:04:59.149 --> 02:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
not correct that's what we're that's
 
02:05:00.990 --> 02:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
what our goal is to have one Amendment
 
02:05:02.790 --> 02:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
but but I just wanted to make sure that
 
02:05:05.069 --> 02:05:05.079 align:start position:0%
you know if you adopted 1334 and then
 
02:05:06.189 --> 02:05:06.199 align:start position:0%
you adopted something that
 
02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative grota put together that
 
02:05:10.790 --> 02:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
amended the expansion of outdoor
 
02:05:14.030 --> 02:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
dining you know they would potentially
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
conflict so I just want to make sure
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
that we adopt you know one
 
02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
change each section we don't have to as
 
02:05:24.750 --> 02:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
a process we don't have to adopt this
 
02:05:27.229 --> 02:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment we can adust adopt
 
02:05:30.350 --> 02:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
the language we want right I mean you'll
 
02:05:33.310 --> 02:05:33.320 align:start position:0%
you'll fold this into the final big
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment and if you say let's not deal
 
02:05:38.229 --> 02:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
with the expansion of outdoor dining
 
02:05:40.750 --> 02:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
portion of the backer Amendment let's
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
let Gro to you
 
02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
know language take take precedence
 
02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
that's fine I just want to make sure I
 
02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
understand what you're
 
02:05:55.950 --> 02:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
no um no I understand so we we will we
 
02:05:57.629 --> 02:05:57.639 align:start position:0%
will look at that and make sure that and
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
did you get um what I discussed with
 
02:06:01.069 --> 02:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire as far as a
 
02:06:03.069 --> 02:06:03.079 align:start position:0%
further subcommittee on this on Thursday
 
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
morning at 10 if possible I did hear
 
02:06:08.229 --> 02:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
that I will be um in another committee
 
02:06:11.790 --> 02:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
at the same time so it it it makes it um
 
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to to listen to
 
02:06:15.910 --> 02:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
both but that's what I've been doing
 
02:06:18.750 --> 02:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
today too so but is that available for
 
02:06:21.709 --> 02:06:21.719 align:start position:0%
us to use I don't know I'm not um the
 
02:06:23.950 --> 02:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
person in charge of the the licenses you
 
02:06:25.990 --> 02:06:26.000 align:start position:0%

02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
goulette okay all right thank you um
 
02:06:31.310 --> 02:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
let's just wrap up real quick for for
 
02:06:33.189 --> 02:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
this one I want to give everyone a
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
chance to speak on the um to speak on
 
02:06:39.229 --> 02:06:39.239 align:start position:0%
the uh Amendment with regard to the
 
02:06:43.629 --> 02:06:43.639 align:start position:0%
vaccines because um after this uh I
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
we'll probably just vote on it at our
 
02:06:46.950 --> 02:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
next meeting I don't I don't want to
 
02:06:49.470 --> 02:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
belabor it um representative Gord did
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
you already you already spoke on the
 
02:06:52.830 --> 02:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine Amendment portion
 
02:06:55.149 --> 02:06:55.159 align:start position:0%
correct she said she
 
02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
defer I said I would defer I also want
 
02:07:01.709 --> 02:07:01.719 align:start position:0%
people to know that I'm not man I don't
 
02:07:05.149 --> 02:07:05.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not agree I don't support mandating
 
02:07:09.629 --> 02:07:09.639 align:start position:0%
vaccines but I support local control as
 
02:07:13.510 --> 02:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
to what they do okay all right thank you
 
02:07:16.030 --> 02:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
02:07:19.350 --> 02:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you Mr chair um
 
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
I will just point out that we do have uh
 
02:07:26.589 --> 02:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
an interstate airport in this state I
 
02:07:29.910 --> 02:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
don't see how it we could possibly
 
02:07:33.069 --> 02:07:33.079 align:start position:0%
mandate to Southwest Airlines whether
 
02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
they feel they need to ensure that every
 
02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
customer that comes on their plane uh
 
02:07:41.470 --> 02:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
has vaccine since they're flying to
 
02:07:44.510 --> 02:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
other states that will mandate that I
 
02:07:47.709 --> 02:07:47.719 align:start position:0%
know for a fact um they have been
 
02:07:51.470 --> 02:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
requesting proof of testing previously I
 
02:07:53.950 --> 02:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
haven't flown recently but I believe
 
02:07:56.510 --> 02:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
that that's probably what's coming so I
 
02:07:58.350 --> 02:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
don't see how we can do that with an
 
02:08:01.629 --> 02:08:01.639 align:start position:0%
airport that um obviously flies to other
 
02:08:04.189 --> 02:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
states and possibly other
 
02:08:07.910 --> 02:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
countries well without addressing um
 
02:08:09.870 --> 02:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
without addressing your the sentiment I
 
02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
can tell you that having just come back
 
02:08:14.350 --> 02:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
from Florida on Southwest they required
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
nothing other than a mask there was no
 
02:08:18.189 --> 02:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
requests for vaccinations or anything
 
02:08:19.390 --> 02:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
like that
 
02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:20.990 align:start position:0%
like that
um

02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:22.950 align:start position:0%
um
representative

02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:08:25.830 --> 02:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you Mr chairman so I
 
02:08:27.669 --> 02:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
understand that we're up against the uh
 
02:08:31.549 --> 02:08:31.559 align:start position:0%
one o00 uh schedule uh and for a break
 
02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
for lunch uh but uh so in my view there
 
02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
are several aspects of this uh proposed
 
02:08:40.549 --> 02:08:40.559 align:start position:0%
amendment the new one the new new
 
02:08:43.149 --> 02:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
variant uh that are completely
 
02:08:45.950 --> 02:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
unworkable uh some would be in violation
 
02:08:49.229 --> 02:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
of federal statute I believe uh
 
02:08:54.030 --> 02:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
and just reminding that uh that we we
 
02:08:57.149 --> 02:08:57.159 align:start position:0%
cannot bind a future legislature uh and
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
so to the degree that we are proposing
 
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
to ban something which is not on the
 
02:09:05.149 --> 02:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
table vaccine passports are not on the
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
table uh state or government mandates of
 
02:09:12.189 --> 02:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
of vaccination are not on the table uh
 
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
so we might as well include you know
 
02:09:18.629 --> 02:09:18.639 align:start position:0%
flying pink elephant or unicorns as well
 
02:09:21.669 --> 02:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh is ter in terms of the workability of
 
02:09:21.679 --> 02:09:22.750 align:start position:0%
uh is ter in terms of the workability of
this

02:09:22.750 --> 02:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:09:25.310 --> 02:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
amendment I will speak to it at length
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
when when we have an opportunity but
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
you're intending to take this up at 10
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
o'clock on Thursday morning again Mr
 
02:09:33.310 --> 02:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
chairman um actually no the next time
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to speak about this
 
02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
probably be in full committee no I
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
thought we were having a subcommittee
 
02:09:39.119 --> 02:09:40.830 align:start position:0%
thought we were having a subcommittee
work

02:09:40.830 --> 02:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:43.149 align:start position:0%
work
s

02:09:43.149 --> 02:09:43.159 align:start position:0%
s
 
02:09:46.510 --> 02:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
know I'm sorry we can't hear you m yeah
 
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
that you you could that be repeated I
 
02:09:53.900 --> 02:09:53.910 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:53.910 --> 02:09:56.229 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:09:56.229 --> 02:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:09:56.239 --> 02:09:57.830 align:start position:0%
[Music]
it

02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:10:00.830 --> 02:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
so had a chance to speak on this I don't
 
02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:02.639 align:start position:0%
I don't recall I mean all all I'll say
 
02:10:05.709 --> 02:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
is that the word vaccine passport may be
 
02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
loaded um I'll admit that but if we're
 
02:10:10.910 --> 02:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
going to permit I mean if there's going
 
02:10:13.149 --> 02:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
to be a requirement either by the state
 
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
or by private businesses in effect you
 
02:10:18.910 --> 02:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
create something like a b vaccine
 
02:10:21.549 --> 02:10:21.559 align:start position:0%
passport whatever you want to call it um
 
02:10:23.310 --> 02:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
and certainly if you're if it ever is
 
02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
required to fly then it's basically what
 
02:10:29.950 --> 02:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
it is um the only thing I'll say is um
 
02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
there are more than one state that have
 
02:10:35.189 --> 02:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
already passed the law completely
 
02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
prohibiting any business from requiring
 
02:10:39.229 --> 02:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
it and I don't know of any state that
 
02:10:41.470 --> 02:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't have an airport that has flights
 
02:10:46.030 --> 02:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
out of the state so um you know this is
 
02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a larger issue there
 
02:10:48.990 --> 02:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
and there's going to be some
 
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
accommodation to it I believe um anyway
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
I mean I think it could be a larger
 
02:10:57.430 --> 02:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
discussion but right so that that's my
 
02:11:00.629 --> 02:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
was my question are we further
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting uh at which this
 
02:11:06.629 --> 02:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
will be thoroughly vetted because we
 
02:11:08.990 --> 02:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
haven't done that at this
 
02:11:11.709 --> 02:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
time we will um whatever's left to be
 
02:11:13.709 --> 02:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
done at the next subcommittee uh meeting
 
02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
with regard to this we will okay so
 
02:11:17.629 --> 02:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
that's going to be on Thursday morning
 
02:11:19.310 --> 02:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
at 10 o' Mr chairman that's what I'm
 
02:11:21.790 --> 02:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
trying to determine that's correct um
 
02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
although I don't want to I don't want to
 
02:11:25.790 --> 02:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
spend an inent amount of time on a on an
 
02:11:28.549 --> 02:11:28.559 align:start position:0%
amendment that we already kind of uh
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
Lear on as far as voting um I would just
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close uh this meeting
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
myself um with my final comments um I
 
02:11:41.830 --> 02:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
think that the state of New Hampshire um
 
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
has a tradition of person Liberty um I
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
would be against any mandated
 
02:11:49.950 --> 02:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
immunizations any mandated records of
 
02:11:52.030 --> 02:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
immunizations or any government or
 
02:11:54.870 --> 02:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
private entity um demanding proof of
 
02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
immunization I think it's um you know we
 
02:11:59.709 --> 02:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
say that we
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
don't we we're ironically picking you
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
know what we want to interfere with well
 
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
this is a constitutional right to
 
02:12:09.750 --> 02:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
privacy that the the people of New
 
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just voted on in the last
 
02:12:15.069 --> 02:12:15.079 align:start position:0%
election that they hold their privacy to
 
02:12:17.549 --> 02:12:17.559 align:start position:0%
be very dear to them and you cannot get
 
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
any more priv than someone's medical um
 
02:12:23.189 --> 02:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
situation so um I think that the the
 
02:12:24.709 --> 02:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
constitution of the State of New
 
02:12:28.669 --> 02:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire supersedes that um so I will
 
02:12:31.069 --> 02:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
be voting in favor of this in some form
 
02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
or fashion um as we delve into whether
 
02:12:36.030 --> 02:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
or not any amendment to it as necessary
 
02:12:38.149 --> 02:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm going to close this
 
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
hearing and I will see the members of
 
02:12:42.270 --> 02:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee again on Thursday
 
02:12:44.589 --> 02:12:44.599 align:start position:0%
morning at 10 o'clock after we hopefully
 
02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
if we get this Zoom stuff sorted out for
 
02:12:49.470 --> 02:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
that time and with that we're going to
 
02:12:51.629 --> 02:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
go ahead and close this subcommittee
 
02:12:54.069 --> 02:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
meeting and everyone please remember
 
02:12:56.149 --> 02:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
that at 1:00 there will be an executive
 
02:12:59.270 --> 02:12:59.280 align:start position:0%

03:00:52.950 --> 03:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:00:54.750 --> 03:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
uh a
 
03:00:58.110 --> 03:00:58.120 align:start position:0%
Pam yes what I'm going to do if it's
 
03:01:00.910 --> 03:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
okay with you is to continue the process
 
03:01:06.110 --> 03:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
of uh uh committee work session and
 
03:01:09.510 --> 03:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
write up a separate uh committee report
 
03:01:12.750 --> 03:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
on each subsection put them together so
 
03:01:14.309 --> 03:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
you you have separate
 
03:01:17.269 --> 03:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
items each one makes sense each section
 
03:01:20.309 --> 03:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
is separate makes sense yeah since we
 
03:01:20.319 --> 03:01:21.910 align:start position:0%
is separate makes sense yeah since we
only

03:01:21.910 --> 03:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
only
 
03:01:24.590 --> 03:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
have you know four sections that haven't
 
03:01:25.590 --> 03:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
yet been
 
03:01:28.150 --> 03:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
addressed okay well just add it to the
 
03:01:31.510 --> 03:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
previous I guess that's yeah that's the
 
03:01:34.870 --> 03:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
way I was doing it before and right all
 
03:01:42.630 --> 03:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:42.640 --> 03:01:45.269 align:start position:0%

03:10:49.070 --> 03:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
Williams who is um also an advocate for
 
03:10:51.349 --> 03:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
daycare both support this amendment and
 
03:10:54.030 --> 03:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
I support it for the reasons that we
 
03:10:57.670 --> 03:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
need daycare workers in um immediate
 
03:10:59.550 --> 03:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
need for daycare workers so that we can
 
03:11:02.469 --> 03:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
get our young families back to work the
 
03:11:06.110 --> 03:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:08.750 --> 03:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
work um I have nothing further to add I
 
03:11:13.070 --> 03:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
think that covers it yes uh since we're
 
03:11:16.550 --> 03:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
since we're being less formal than usual
 
03:11:20.309 --> 03:11:20.319 align:start position:0%
represent peric I got some language
 
03:11:24.309 --> 03:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
from Melissa Clemens at the licensing uh
 
03:11:28.110 --> 03:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
office and she suggested that it that
 
03:11:30.349 --> 03:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
the documented life
 
03:11:33.910 --> 03:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
experience shall it shall include
 
03:11:36.349 --> 03:11:36.359 align:start position:0%
experience of the same age
 
03:11:39.870 --> 03:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
children because uh she thought that
 
03:11:42.590 --> 03:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
that was very an important distinction
 
03:11:44.429 --> 03:11:44.439 align:start position:0%
and and I would agree with her would you
 
03:11:46.910 --> 03:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
agree to modify your Amendment with that
 
03:11:49.950 --> 03:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
uh that language yes I will I'll I'll
 
03:11:54.150 --> 03:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:57.910 --> 03:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
meeting represent L you're okay yes I've
 
03:12:03.309 --> 03:12:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:06.870 --> 03:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh it makes perfect sense that if you're
 
03:12:08.830 --> 03:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
if you know how to deal with a a
 
03:12:10.590 --> 03:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
12-year-old you may or may not know how
 
03:12:13.910 --> 03:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
to deal with a two-year-old
 
03:12:15.790 --> 03:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
nobody knows
 
03:12:18.309 --> 03:12:18.319 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative Schmidt
 
03:12:22.309 --> 03:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
for that insight for your vast agent
 
03:12:25.030 --> 03:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
experience repres I'd like to say that's
 
03:12:27.550 --> 03:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
the other shoe that dropped
 
03:12:31.309 --> 03:12:31.319 align:start position:0%
because um Miss Clement wanted to say
 
03:12:33.510 --> 03:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
something after we had finished and we
 
03:12:35.630 --> 03:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
did not she did not get an opportunity
 
03:12:37.790 --> 03:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what she was up to so
 
03:12:40.590 --> 03:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
that's kind of nice to yes sent me a
 
03:12:44.070 --> 03:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
note and um and she pointed this out and
 
03:12:48.469 --> 03:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
I I agreed with her on that issue and so
 
03:12:50.710 --> 03:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
bringing it Forward May point out my
 
03:12:53.030 --> 03:12:53.040 align:start position:0%

discussion on this this amendment which
 
03:13:02.790 --> 03:13:02.800 align:start position:0%

1162 is that correct yes it was the
 
03:13:23.309 --> 03:13:23.319 align:start position:0%
basic change to add some specificity for
 
03:13:26.269 --> 03:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
the life experience was approved by the
 
03:13:28.710 --> 03:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee this language came in after
 
03:13:31.070 --> 03:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee and representative

matter previously in the committee few
 
03:20:57.349 --> 03:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
months back and I don't believe at this
 
03:21:02.630 --> 03:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:04.590 --> 03:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
you I have nothing to add we've
 
03:21:06.630 --> 03:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
discussed this pretty much at L already
 
03:21:10.389 --> 03:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
so thank you yes I will mention that uh
 
03:21:12.750 --> 03:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 209
 
03:21:17.349 --> 03:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
was uh moved itl and not voted on so
 
03:21:22.750 --> 03:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:27.110 --> 03:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
position Madam chair if I may yes
 
03:21:30.950 --> 03:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
represent the issues that this committee
 
03:21:33.469 --> 03:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
discussed concerning this amendment had
 
03:21:35.670 --> 03:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
to do with the fact
 
03:21:35.680 --> 03:21:37.229 align:start position:0%
to do with the fact
that

03:21:37.229 --> 03:21:37.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:21:40.670 --> 03:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
um the some of the considerations from
 
03:21:42.950 --> 03:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
the previous bill had not been
 
03:21:47.870 --> 03:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
considered as well as the
 
03:21:50.910 --> 03:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
um harmonization of the language between
 
03:21:53.590 --> 03:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
the music therapist and Asha and all
 
03:21:56.110 --> 03:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
this has been accomplished in an
 
03:21:58.389 --> 03:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
amendment that I said that was submitted
 
03:22:00.910 --> 03:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
to the committee and a lot of work was
 
03:22:03.870 --> 03:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
put on this on this and I would imagine
 
03:22:06.510 --> 03:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
I would hope that when you people vote
 
03:22:09.590 --> 03:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
today they will consider
 
03:22:15.670 --> 03:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:15.680 --> 03:22:17.229 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:22:17.229 --> 03:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:22:20.990 --> 03:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
Roy I would just um ask representative
 
03:22:23.269 --> 03:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
Gorda because I'm not familiar with the
 
03:22:25.710 --> 03:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
amendment is it anything new that we
 
03:22:27.870 --> 03:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
haven't already discussed regarding
 
03:22:31.429 --> 03:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
music therapists in the previous uh
 
03:22:33.710 --> 03:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
months ago and last year regarding the
 
03:22:35.309 --> 03:22:35.319 align:start position:0%
lure of Music
 
03:22:38.189 --> 03:22:38.199 align:start position:0%
therapists yes thank you for the
 
03:22:40.790 --> 03:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
question there was a disagreement in the
 
03:22:43.750 --> 03:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
language or there was a disagreement in
 
03:22:48.510 --> 03:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
how music therapists versus um speech
 
03:22:51.110 --> 03:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
therapists did their work and how their
 
03:22:53.590 --> 03:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
territories were going to be carved out
 
03:22:56.429 --> 03:22:56.439 align:start position:0%
and this has been agreed upon between
 
03:22:58.469 --> 03:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
the two organizations on the na on the
 
03:23:01.389 --> 03:23:01.399 align:start position:0%
national level and this language was
 
03:23:05.550 --> 03:23:05.560 align:start position:0%
sent to me and miss miss chesterly who
 
03:23:09.389 --> 03:23:09.399 align:start position:0%
was an a represented the a
 
03:23:14.030 --> 03:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:17.550 --> 03:23:17.560 align:start position:0%
uh stood with who who had not supported
 
03:23:20.550 --> 03:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment now supports the amendment
 
03:23:22.910 --> 03:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
has withdrawn her protests which I think
 
03:23:25.150 --> 03:23:25.160 align:start position:0%
is a significant
 
03:23:28.469 --> 03:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
change thank you for the question
 
03:23:28.479 --> 03:23:30.630 align:start position:0%
change thank you for the question
representative

03:23:30.630 --> 03:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:23:33.590 --> 03:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
Schultz yes Madam chair thank you I
 
03:23:34.950 --> 03:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate the hard work that
 
03:23:36.830 --> 03:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative groda and others have
 
03:23:41.910 --> 03:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
done to um have that level of work and
 
03:23:44.389 --> 03:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
and compromise I think we need all the
 
03:23:47.269 --> 03:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
tool all the the tools we need in the
 
03:23:50.550 --> 03:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
toolbx should be available and I think
 
03:23:56.389 --> 03:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
if we um itl this um I do think that
 
03:23:59.309 --> 03:23:59.319 align:start position:0%
this will leave music therapy only
 
03:24:04.229 --> 03:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
available to um those who can afford it
 
03:24:07.349 --> 03:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
and I think that is a
 
03:24:10.790 --> 03:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
shame thank you for that that position
 
03:24:13.510 --> 03:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:24:13.520 --> 03:24:14.750 align:start position:0%
anyone else
[Music]

03:24:14.750 --> 03:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:24:17.950 --> 03:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
um the uh Amendment clearly would make
 
03:24:20.429 --> 03:24:20.439 align:start position:0%
the bill better and if the bill goes
 
03:24:22.670 --> 03:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
forward I would vote for the amendment
 
03:24:27.309 --> 03:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
because it clears the areas of
 
03:24:31.750 --> 03:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh areas practice the trouble is as I
 
03:24:33.870 --> 03:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
said in my parliamentary inquiry when
 
03:24:36.790 --> 03:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
this came up last session and perhaps
 
03:24:39.110 --> 03:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
this will eventually
 
03:24:42.309 --> 03:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
survive Edna is charged with public
 
03:24:45.710 --> 03:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
health and safety not
 
03:24:49.110 --> 03:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
desirability or or the path or ironing
 
03:24:51.630 --> 03:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
out the path taking the first step down
 
03:24:54.590 --> 03:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
the road of insurance
 
03:24:57.630 --> 03:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursement if we change
 
03:25:03.389 --> 03:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
our Charter or if that happens and it's
 
03:25:06.070 --> 03:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
a question that it's proper for us to
 
03:25:13.110 --> 03:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
consider this in so that uh we get they
 
03:25:15.030 --> 03:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
can get insurance
 
03:25:17.349 --> 03:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
reimbursement okay but that's not our
 
03:25:20.710 --> 03:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
Charter they do have right now
 
03:25:23.269 --> 03:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
certification uh there is a National
 
03:25:26.630 --> 03:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
Organization that attests to their
 
03:25:31.990 --> 03:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
credentials so I I'm unhappily not
 
03:25:34.990 --> 03:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
supporting this because they're good
 
03:25:39.229 --> 03:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
people but that's not our charge
 
03:25:42.790 --> 03:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
and so there I am
 
03:25:44.590 --> 03:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me let me just please finish with
 
03:25:47.429 --> 03:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
this I don't I cannot see a credible
 
03:25:50.150 --> 03:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
threat to public health and safety if
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
this is unlicensed I just I've heard
 
03:25:55.429 --> 03:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
that but I I it's just it's just not
 
03:25:57.510 --> 03:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
believable to me and now I am finished
 
03:26:02.110 --> 03:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:04.469 --> 03:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
goolie thank you madam chair I will be
 
03:26:08.110 --> 03:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
voting against the itl I think it's
 
03:26:10.630 --> 03:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh a big accomplishment that these two
 
03:26:12.790 --> 03:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
groups have come together uh with
 
03:26:15.710 --> 03:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
language that they both can support uh
 
03:26:18.389 --> 03:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
going forward and I think it delineates
 
03:26:21.349 --> 03:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
what the two practices can and cannot do
 
03:26:24.870 --> 03:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
and um so I'm hoping that uh we can
 
03:26:28.550 --> 03:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
defeat the itl so that this uh amendment
 
03:26:32.229 --> 03:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
can be considered and hopefully adopted
 
03:26:35.429 --> 03:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
thank you represent
 
03:26:38.990 --> 03:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you madam chair um as most
 
03:26:40.910 --> 03:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
of you know I chair the Health and Human
 
03:26:42.710 --> 03:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
Services Committee of the house and
 
03:26:46.349 --> 03:26:46.359 align:start position:0%
we've looked at this kind of issue but
 
03:26:48.429 --> 03:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
what you probably don't know is since
 
03:26:51.510 --> 03:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
age 16 I was a have been a professional
 
03:26:53.790 --> 03:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
Church musician directing choirs and
 
03:26:56.349 --> 03:26:56.359 align:start position:0%
playing the organ and every once in a
 
03:26:59.070 --> 03:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
while I it has been my experience and
 
03:27:01.349 --> 03:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
the experience of other people like me
 
03:27:04.469 --> 03:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
where music can be a wonderful help in
 
03:27:07.830 --> 03:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
many ways to people but when we look at
 
03:27:11.710 --> 03:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
professional music therapists um I have
 
03:27:15.710 --> 03:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
a a big red flag raised and we are on
 
03:27:19.990 --> 03:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
page 38 lines 25 and following of at
 
03:27:22.429 --> 03:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
least the bill as it's uh located on the
 
03:27:24.870 --> 03:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
House website the practice of music
 
03:27:28.910 --> 03:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
therapy it says does not include the
 
03:27:33.870 --> 03:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
screening diagnosis or assessment of any
 
03:27:37.110 --> 03:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
physical mental or communication
 
03:27:39.469 --> 03:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
disorder uh that is quite different from
 
03:27:42.189 --> 03:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
the therapists I know including um art
 
03:27:44.870 --> 03:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
therapists and others um if you cannot
 
03:27:48.510 --> 03:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
diagnose something that is wrong if you
 
03:27:51.550 --> 03:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
cannot screen for it if you cannot give
 
03:27:52.429 --> 03:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
it a
 
03:27:55.990 --> 03:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
descriptor um that's just leaving good
 
03:27:59.469 --> 03:27:59.479 align:start position:0%
folks who are Musical and use their
 
03:28:01.750 --> 03:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
music to help people who may need a
 
03:28:03.670 --> 03:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
little bit of help in other words this
 
03:28:06.110 --> 03:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
is either too much or too little and I
 
03:28:08.670 --> 03:28:08.680 align:start position:0%
really don't see the need for such uh a
 
03:28:10.229 --> 03:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
section as this to go
 
03:28:10.239 --> 03:28:12.150 align:start position:0%
section as this to go
forward

03:28:12.150 --> 03:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:28:14.950 --> 03:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:28:17.910 --> 03:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chairman well uh
 
03:28:20.830 --> 03:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
we are definitely talk talking about the
 
03:28:24.070 --> 03:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
health of young children I've been in
 
03:28:26.150 --> 03:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
this one of the establishments in Dover
 
03:28:29.630 --> 03:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
that happens to be in my district uh and
 
03:28:32.750 --> 03:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
they deal almost exclusively with young
 
03:28:35.349 --> 03:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
children uh and they're not just playing
 
03:28:38.790 --> 03:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
music to them by any means uh this is a
 
03:28:42.150 --> 03:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
recognized uh profession and special
 
03:28:44.189 --> 03:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
uh the language that representative
 
03:28:47.590 --> 03:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
Pearson just alluded to uh is to
 
03:28:50.189 --> 03:28:50.199 align:start position:0%
differentiate them from speech
 
03:28:51.590 --> 03:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
pathologists and
 
03:28:54.469 --> 03:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
audiologists who are uh medical
 
03:28:57.030 --> 03:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
professionals not necessarily mental
 
03:29:02.189 --> 03:29:02.199 align:start position:0%
health uh Specialists so uh because this
 
03:29:05.150 --> 03:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
is a profession that we are not the
 
03:29:08.349 --> 03:29:08.359 align:start position:0%
first to recognize by any means uh I
 
03:29:11.830 --> 03:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
think that uh we should uh
 
03:29:15.229 --> 03:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
definitely act on behalf of uh
 
03:29:17.750 --> 03:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
children's better mental health and I
 
03:29:20.590 --> 03:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
will be voting against the itl as
 
03:29:28.750 --> 03:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:40.110 --> 03:29:40.120 align:start position:0%

93 they try everything for me
 
03:30:22.670 --> 03:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
mentally but uh a friend of mine
 
03:30:22.680 --> 03:30:24.189 align:start position:0%
mentally but uh a friend of mine
starting

03:30:24.189 --> 03:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
starting
 
03:30:26.189 --> 03:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
uh playing
 
03:30:30.189 --> 03:30:30.199 align:start position:0%
music for me and then he he was in the

for he was in New York City I I was here

03:30:41.910 --> 03:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
in my life and after three or four
 
03:30:46.030 --> 03:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
session he not a therapist but we grow
 
03:30:49.189 --> 03:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
up together in ha we we used to play

03:31:05.670 --> 03:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh after months I feel
 
03:31:09.269 --> 03:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
difference I have uh I have that in my
 
03:31:12.870 --> 03:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
mind since 9 until
 
03:31:18.349 --> 03:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
today uh I'm going to vote against this
 
03:31:21.510 --> 03:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
itl because music can make big
 
03:31:26.590 --> 03:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:29.950 --> 03:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair um I believe
 
03:31:32.469 --> 03:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
that during the original Bill even we
 
03:31:36.030 --> 03:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that uh through the use
 
03:31:36.040 --> 03:31:36.910 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that uh through the use
of

03:31:36.910 --> 03:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:31:39.349 --> 03:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
Music uh some of these folks have been
 
03:31:43.189 --> 03:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
able to reach uh particularly Disturbed
 
03:31:47.510 --> 03:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
autistic children and uh Alzheimer's
 
03:31:50.150 --> 03:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
patients uh representative scitec if
 
03:31:54.189 --> 03:31:54.199 align:start position:0%
that's not somewhat healing um I don't
 
03:31:57.269 --> 03:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
know what would be thank you I will be
 
03:32:03.429 --> 03:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:05.950 --> 03:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
itl thank you madam
 
03:32:08.950 --> 03:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
chair music therapy is used
 
03:32:12.389 --> 03:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
for people who have
 
03:32:15.429 --> 03:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
who have executive function
 
03:32:18.510 --> 03:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
disorders um who are artist who are
 
03:32:22.269 --> 03:32:22.279 align:start position:0%
autistic who have cognitive uh function
 
03:32:25.389 --> 03:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
dis disorders this is not um this is
 
03:32:28.670 --> 03:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
used as a way of reaching those those
 
03:32:31.389 --> 03:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
people and helping
 
03:32:33.870 --> 03:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
them learn
 
03:32:36.469 --> 03:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
different a new a different way to learn
 
03:32:39.389 --> 03:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
than the conventional way that those of
 
03:32:41.469 --> 03:32:41.479 align:start position:0%
us who don't have those
 
03:32:44.030 --> 03:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
dysfunctions learn so I think that it's
 
03:32:46.189 --> 03:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
an important
 
03:32:46.199 --> 03:32:47.950 align:start position:0%
an important
consideration

03:32:47.950 --> 03:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
03:32:50.429 --> 03:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
for as a group of
 
03:32:52.510 --> 03:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
therapy and it's just not about
 
03:32:54.950 --> 03:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
listening to music and playing music
 
03:32:57.110 --> 03:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you I think that we we all know
 
03:32:59.630 --> 03:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
that having heard testimony and seeing
 
03:33:04.870 --> 03:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:07.750 --> 03:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
year I'd like to say that I'm delighted
 
03:33:08.590 --> 03:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
that the
 
03:33:10.950 --> 03:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
audiologists have the speech language
 
03:33:12.910 --> 03:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
ologists have worked out their conflict
 
03:33:15.189 --> 03:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
with the music therapists because there
 
03:33:17.950 --> 03:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
are music therapists in the state and
 
03:33:20.950 --> 03:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
they are able to work um as
 
03:33:22.950 --> 03:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt has testified
 
03:33:25.030 --> 03:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
they have a center in his
 
03:33:27.710 --> 03:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
town the issue is do they need to be
 
03:33:30.189 --> 03:33:30.199 align:start position:0%
licensed and that's an entirely
 
03:33:33.510 --> 03:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
different matter than is music therapy a
 
03:33:36.469 --> 03:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
good thing and so that's that's the
 
03:33:37.830 --> 03:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
point that we're voting on is should
 
03:33:39.750 --> 03:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
they be
 
03:33:42.870 --> 03:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
licensed and is there anyone else who
 
03:33:47.189 --> 03:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:47.199 --> 03:33:49.309 align:start position:0%
 
speak

03:33:49.309 --> 03:33:49.319 align:start position:0%
speak
 
03:33:51.630 --> 03:33:51.640 align:start position:0%
there's representative Pearson and then
 
03:33:51.640 --> 03:33:52.990 align:start position:0%
there's representative Pearson and then
representative

03:33:52.990 --> 03:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:33:56.189 --> 03:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
Broda I do very much appreciate the
 
03:33:58.309 --> 03:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
positive comments made on the use of
 
03:34:02.070 --> 03:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
music to help people uh my concern is
 
03:34:06.030 --> 03:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
that uh since they are not involved in
 
03:34:09.590 --> 03:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
screening or diagnosis or assessment uh
 
03:34:13.309 --> 03:34:13.319 align:start position:0%
which is often what various licensed
 
03:34:15.189 --> 03:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
board certified board licensed
 
03:34:18.510 --> 03:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
professionals do uh certainly we can
 
03:34:21.469 --> 03:34:21.479 align:start position:0%
have music therapists in the state to
 
03:34:24.910 --> 03:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
our profit the question is really do we
 
03:34:28.349 --> 03:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
need to license them and that's why I
 
03:34:30.670 --> 03:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
support the itl I don't think we do I
 
03:34:35.710 --> 03:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:38.670 --> 03:34:38.680 align:start position:0%
been thank you madam chair the purpose
 
03:34:41.710 --> 03:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
of the lessons is to support the
 
03:34:44.389 --> 03:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
training that these individuals go to
 
03:34:47.150 --> 03:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
there are specific courses and specific
 
03:34:50.070 --> 03:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
training and specific degrees that are
 
03:34:53.790 --> 03:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
geared towards that and one would hope
 
03:34:56.630 --> 03:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
that we would support that so that the
 
03:34:59.590 --> 03:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
individuals who tell themselves as music
 
03:35:03.070 --> 03:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
therapists are actually licensed music
 
03:35:06.229 --> 03:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
therapists and have taken the necessary
 
03:35:09.349 --> 03:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
courses and have the necessary knowledge
 
03:35:11.389 --> 03:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
to address
 
03:35:14.309 --> 03:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
cognitive learning skills thank
 
03:35:16.550 --> 03:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
03:35:19.550 --> 03:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
sh to representative Pearson's point and
 
03:35:21.349 --> 03:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
I do think it's a good one there are
 
03:35:24.349 --> 03:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
other aspects of the medical field that
 
03:35:27.189 --> 03:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
we license that do know diagnosing of
 
03:35:32.510 --> 03:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
any kind like RNs psychiatric RNs uh
 
03:35:36.110 --> 03:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
lnas there are multiple
 
03:35:38.710 --> 03:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
um health care providers that don't
 
03:35:42.110 --> 03:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
diagnose I don't see that for me as a
 
03:35:45.229 --> 03:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
reason to not license them I think that
 
03:35:46.830 --> 03:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
they have
 
03:35:49.189 --> 03:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
demonstrated the proper level of
 
03:35:49.199 --> 03:35:50.790 align:start position:0%
demonstrated the proper level of
professional

03:35:50.790 --> 03:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
professional
 
03:35:53.349 --> 03:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
professionalism and a need for our
 
03:35:55.710 --> 03:35:55.720 align:start position:0%
citizens to have access to licensed
 
03:35:58.030 --> 03:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
professionals as recognized by the
 
03:36:01.510 --> 03:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
granite state so I will still be voting
 
03:36:01.520 --> 03:36:03.670 align:start position:0%
granite state so I will still be voting
against

03:36:03.670 --> 03:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
against
 
03:36:07.790 --> 03:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
itl leus uh thank you madam chair uh I
 
03:36:11.070 --> 03:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
heard concerns about making sure
 
03:36:14.030 --> 03:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
that people to present themselves as
 
03:36:14.040 --> 03:36:15.790 align:start position:0%
that people to present themselves as
music

03:36:15.790 --> 03:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
music
 
03:36:18.670 --> 03:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
therapists have appropriate training
 
03:36:20.510 --> 03:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that there's
 
03:36:22.469 --> 03:36:22.479 align:start position:0%
already a
 
03:36:25.469 --> 03:36:25.479 align:start position:0%
certification available through National
 
03:36:27.750 --> 03:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
Organization and if someone's wants to
 
03:36:29.950 --> 03:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
know whether or not you know the music
 
03:36:31.550 --> 03:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
therapist they're considering
 
03:36:33.990 --> 03:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
hiring has appropriate training they can

03:36:45.389 --> 03:36:45.399 align:start position:0%
people you just referenced as not doing
 
03:36:48.429 --> 03:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
diagnosis can have a direct effect on
 
03:36:50.229 --> 03:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
somebody's health or
 
03:36:54.670 --> 03:36:54.680 align:start position:0%

with improper medication or other
 
03:37:00.429 --> 03:37:00.439 align:start position:0%
applying wrong therapies can do real
 
03:37:03.469 --> 03:37:03.479 align:start position:0%
harm it is hard for me to believe as I
 
03:37:04.710 --> 03:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
had said
 
03:37:07.269 --> 03:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
earlier why am I wasting everyone's time
 
03:37:11.269 --> 03:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
I suppose that um how this can actually
 
03:37:13.550 --> 03:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
be injurious that the public needs to be
 
03:37:17.229 --> 03:37:17.239 align:start position:0%
protected when there is u a level of
 
03:37:20.750 --> 03:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
certification available look I lose the
 
03:37:23.790 --> 03:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
debate every day on its Effectiveness or
 
03:37:23.800 --> 03:37:24.630 align:start position:0%
debate every day on its Effectiveness or
its

03:37:24.630 --> 03:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
its
 
03:37:28.229 --> 03:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
desirability I think I win the debate on
 
03:37:29.910 --> 03:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
public health and
 
03:37:29.920 --> 03:37:32.269 align:start position:0%

motion
 
03:40:10.950 --> 03:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
right I'll move in expedience legisl
 
03:40:12.990 --> 03:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
which I believe was recommendation
 
03:40:14.990 --> 03:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
of I
 
03:40:22.870 --> 03:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:25.710 --> 03:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
you I'll say that it's first it was the
 
03:40:29.150 --> 03:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the
 
03:40:29.160 --> 03:40:31.590 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the
subcommittee

03:40:31.590 --> 03:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
03:40:35.670 --> 03:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
and after that that meeting the several
 
03:40:39.110 --> 03:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
people approached me on the issue
 
03:40:39.120 --> 03:40:41.030 align:start position:0%
people approached me on the issue
and

03:40:41.030 --> 03:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:40:44.150 --> 03:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
we agreed after a few rounds of
 
03:40:46.429 --> 03:40:46.439 align:start position:0%
discussion that it was not really
 
03:40:52.110 --> 03:40:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:54.510 --> 03:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
fellows from uh listening to the
 
03:40:57.990 --> 03:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
discussion about that it seemed to me as
 
03:41:01.950 --> 03:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
if maybe um the senate had good
 
03:41:04.269 --> 03:41:04.279 align:start position:0%
intentions but didn't realize that it
 
03:41:07.150 --> 03:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
would actually severely restrict the
 
03:41:09.030 --> 03:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
number of people who could make that
 
03:41:09.040 --> 03:41:12.150 align:start position:0%
number of people who could make that
assessment

03:41:12.150 --> 03:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:14.950 --> 03:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
exactly represent Pearson thank you
 
03:41:16.990 --> 03:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair this was one of the sections
 
03:41:19.910 --> 03:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
that was sent over to me um as chairman
 
03:41:23.510 --> 03:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services I uh spent
 
03:41:25.510 --> 03:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
some time discussing this with the
 
03:41:27.469 --> 03:41:27.479 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human
 
03:41:30.469 --> 03:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
Services and there was an accusation
 
03:41:32.429 --> 03:41:32.439 align:start position:0%
that unless we restrict it to registered
 
03:41:35.070 --> 03:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
nurses anybody off the street including
 
03:41:38.149 --> 03:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
the janitor can make a diagnosis but
 
03:41:40.750 --> 03:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
what's in place presently is the
 
03:41:44.389 --> 03:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
strikeouts so it talks about in line 29
 
03:41:47.349 --> 03:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
an individual with equivalent training
 
03:41:49.750 --> 03:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
designated by the department and they
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
said their present practice is to do
 
03:41:53.790 --> 03:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
exactly that they don't have their
 
03:41:56.189 --> 03:41:56.199 align:start position:0%
secretaries or their janitors make these
 
03:41:59.309 --> 03:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
diagnosis but to restrict it to
 
03:42:01.950 --> 03:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
registered nurses which line 32 would
 
03:42:04.830 --> 03:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
have us do would significantly up the
 
03:42:09.309 --> 03:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
cost without providing any better um
 
03:42:12.110 --> 03:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
quality of product because the again the
 
03:42:15.030 --> 03:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
operative phrase in line 29 is an
 
03:42:17.269 --> 03:42:17.279 align:start position:0%
individual with equivalent training
 
03:42:18.950 --> 03:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's what they do now they haven't
 
03:42:21.910 --> 03:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
found difficulty with that to restrict
 
03:42:24.590 --> 03:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
it to nurses would hamper the work that
 
03:42:28.149 --> 03:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
they're doing in various places so um
 
03:42:29.990 --> 03:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
I've talked with others in the medical
 
03:42:32.670 --> 03:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
field as well and the consensus I heard
 
03:42:35.550 --> 03:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
was leave it as it is you take out
 
03:42:38.189 --> 03:42:38.199 align:start position:0%
section eight it reverts to what it was
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
which is the strikeouts
 
03:42:41.040 --> 03:42:42.630 align:start position:0%
which is the strikeouts

03:44:42.469 --> 03:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:46.110 --> 03:44:46.120 align:start position:0%
um which amendment do you choose um 8
 
03:44:52.309 --> 03:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:54.990 --> 03:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
morning just just to confirm Madam chair
 
03:44:58.870 --> 03:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
is that the uh amendment that uh Dr
 
03:45:02.389 --> 03:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
Warner requested me to put in I don't
 
03:45:04.710 --> 03:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
know representative Schmid because I
 
03:45:07.950 --> 03:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
also had one that I put in on the
 
03:45:11.830 --> 03:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
benefit from opl C which is somewhat
 
03:45:16.469 --> 03:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
different from yours but um we might we
 
03:45:18.670 --> 03:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
need to know which one
 
03:45:20.790 --> 03:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative which means before we
 
03:45:22.590 --> 03:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
decide which is the one we should be
 
03:45:25.750 --> 03:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
discussing this is the oplc draft
 
03:45:29.110 --> 03:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
legislation okay 5321
 
03:45:32.510 --> 03:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
LBC 803 this morning I help to write
 
03:45:35.830 --> 03:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid and I will second
 
03:45:35.840 --> 03:45:38.670 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid and I will second
the

03:45:38.670 --> 03:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:38.680 --> 03:45:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
motion

03:45:41.750 --> 03:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:44.030 --> 03:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
we have yes they're they're both here
 
03:45:56.189 --> 03:45:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:59.469 --> 03:45:59.479 align:start position:0%
out you wish to speak to your motion uh
 
03:46:02.429 --> 03:46:02.439 align:start position:0%
sure yeah this is the oplc amendment um
 
03:46:05.710 --> 03:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
as Pam stated it's been created with
 
03:46:07.910 --> 03:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
consultation with Lindsay
 
03:46:10.349 --> 03:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
Courtney so this is the want to I would
 
03:46:13.149 --> 03:46:13.159 align:start position:0%
like to move forward thank
 
03:46:16.110 --> 03:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
you yes and I will
 
03:46:18.910 --> 03:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh speak to this I
 
03:46:21.030 --> 03:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
helped discuss
 
03:46:24.349 --> 03:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
it I asked Lindsay to write it once we
 
03:46:27.349 --> 03:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
when we're discussing it the issue is
 
03:46:29.710 --> 03:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
that at the moment approximately
 
03:46:32.510 --> 03:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the the psychologists
 
03:46:35.309 --> 03:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
licensed in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:46:38.110 --> 03:46:38.120 align:start position:0%
have temporary or emergency
 
03:46:40.630 --> 03:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
licenses and the reason and they have
 
03:46:44.110 --> 03:46:44.120 align:start position:0%
not had any success in converting those
 
03:46:46.110 --> 03:46:46.120 align:start position:0%
to permanent
 
03:46:48.630 --> 03:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
licenses anecdotally this includes
 
03:46:50.990 --> 03:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
people who live in New Hampshire but
 
03:46:53.550 --> 03:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
practice in Massachusetts or Vermont
 
03:46:57.389 --> 03:46:57.399 align:start position:0%
rain because they didn't get a license
 
03:47:00.870 --> 03:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
there and even though the requirements
 
03:47:04.710 --> 03:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
are on paper almost identical they can't
 
03:47:07.830 --> 03:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
seem to get a New Hampshire psychologist
 
03:47:13.269 --> 03:47:13.279 align:start position:0%
license so what this amendment does it
 
03:47:16.710 --> 03:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
allows it requires a
 
03:47:20.030 --> 03:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
license a person with a
 
03:47:22.469 --> 03:47:22.479 align:start position:0%
temporary license to practice or an
 
03:47:22.479 --> 03:47:24.630 align:start position:0%
temporary license to practice or an
emergency

03:47:24.630 --> 03:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
03:47:28.070 --> 03:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
license that has worked in the state for
 
03:47:31.750 --> 03:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
at least 90 days in good standing and
 
03:47:33.830 --> 03:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
completes the application and pays the
 
03:47:37.229 --> 03:47:37.239 align:start position:0%
Fe and is promoted to a full Hampshire
 
03:47:41.229 --> 03:47:41.239 align:start position:0%
psychologist license which by Statute
 
03:47:43.710 --> 03:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
specifically allows them to practice
 
03:47:43.720 --> 03:47:44.870 align:start position:0%
specifically allows them to practice
tele

03:47:44.870 --> 03:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
tele
 
03:47:48.710 --> 03:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
medicine and I think that makes a lot
 
03:47:51.830 --> 03:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
more sense than trying to create a new
 
03:47:53.990 --> 03:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
level of
 
03:47:57.030 --> 03:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
license since we all
 
03:48:00.389 --> 03:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
that since
 
03:48:04.189 --> 03:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
the the ACT required as part of a
 
03:48:04.199 --> 03:48:05.550 align:start position:0%
the the ACT required as part of a
regular

03:48:05.550 --> 03:48:05.560 align:start position:0%
regular
 
03:48:10.710 --> 03:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
license so I would hope that we can
 
03:48:12.750 --> 03:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate the bottleneck at the board
 
03:48:15.149 --> 03:48:15.159 align:start position:0%
which is what I think the issue
 
03:48:19.510 --> 03:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
is and representative L just to help me
 
03:48:24.189 --> 03:48:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:27.990 --> 03:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
that this continues allowing this
 
03:48:30.189 --> 03:48:30.199 align:start position:0%
uh anybody who's got a temporary
 
03:48:32.269 --> 03:48:32.279 align:start position:0%
emergency license can
 
03:48:36.149 --> 03:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
get certain requirements can get a good
 
03:48:38.750 --> 03:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
practice what does this do to deal with
 
03:48:40.790 --> 03:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
the bot
 
03:48:44.229 --> 03:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
it's at the back flip it over on on the
 
03:48:45.830 --> 03:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
back number
 
03:48:49.349 --> 03:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
four it says not withstanding any other
 
03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
provision of law to the contrary the
 
03:48:53.389 --> 03:48:53.399 align:start position:0%
office of professional license or
 
03:48:55.750 --> 03:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
certification shall issue a
 
03:48:59.630 --> 03:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
license the board of psychology seems to
 
03:49:01.269 --> 03:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
want to
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:08.319 --> 03:49:10.469 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:49:10.469 --> 03:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:49:12.070 --> 03:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
data from
 
03:49:15.950 --> 03:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
your supervised practice when you
 
03:49:19.349 --> 03:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
beginning school transcripts which are a
 
03:49:22.750 --> 03:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:27.469 --> 03:49:27.479 align:start position:0%
even um okay so the bottle is is getting
 
03:49:30.389 --> 03:49:30.399 align:start position:0%
people the emergency licenses it's not
 
03:49:32.349 --> 03:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
just the normal status of somebody
 
03:49:34.590 --> 03:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
applying for a license under normal
 
03:49:37.110 --> 03:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
times no the emergency licenses are
 
03:49:45.469 --> 03:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:48.189 --> 03:49:48.199 align:start position:0%
days the pro the thing is that what this
 
03:49:49.950 --> 03:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
would do would allow someone the
 
03:49:52.590 --> 03:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
bottleneck is getting a permanent full
 
03:49:54.750 --> 03:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
psychologist license sure I guess which
 
03:49:56.830 --> 03:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
is under the control board rather than
 
03:50:01.309 --> 03:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
the appeal so I assume the the temporary
 
03:50:04.389 --> 03:50:04.399 align:start position:0%
or emergency licenses are they are they
 
03:50:06.149 --> 03:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
going away after the state of emergency
 
03:50:08.670 --> 03:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
or will they continue and if they're
 
03:50:10.189 --> 03:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
going away
 
03:50:13.670 --> 03:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
this might provide an initial group of
 
03:50:15.510 --> 03:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
people getting permit licenses but is it
 
03:50:17.149 --> 03:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
going to help going
 
03:50:21.030 --> 03:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
forward uh temporary and emergency
 
03:50:24.990 --> 03:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
licenses are already in statute for
 
03:50:27.309 --> 03:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
psychologists it is not based on an
 
03:50:30.790 --> 03:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
emergency order it's only the emergency
 
03:50:34.269 --> 03:50:34.279 align:start position:0%
license that is granted by the oplc that
 
03:50:35.990 --> 03:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
is an emergency
 
03:50:40.830 --> 03:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
workorder but there are um
 
03:50:44.429 --> 03:50:44.439 align:start position:0%
329b Cola 20 already deals with
 
03:50:49.389 --> 03:50:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:51.750 --> 03:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
licenses thank
 
03:50:55.670 --> 03:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:58.309 --> 03:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
else um Madame chair I was trying to
 
03:51:00.189 --> 03:51:00.199 align:start position:0%
raise my hand
 
03:51:04.349 --> 03:51:04.359 align:start position:0%
but me I do have a question about the
 
03:51:08.110 --> 03:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
amendment so the amendment strikes out
 
03:51:11.189 --> 03:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
tempor in the in line I'm not sure it's
 
03:51:13.110 --> 03:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the amendment it
 
03:51:15.630 --> 03:51:15.640 align:start position:0%
strikes out temporary and
 
03:51:17.870 --> 03:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
emergency and replaces it with
 
03:51:19.750 --> 03:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
applicants from other
 
03:51:23.510 --> 03:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
states and then at the
 
03:51:26.550 --> 03:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
bottom it says section four
 
03:51:28.590 --> 03:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any other provision of
 
03:51:30.870 --> 03:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
state law to the
 
03:51:33.710 --> 03:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
contrary um it starts with this is the
 
03:51:35.910 --> 03:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
first point is a the individuals has
 
03:51:38.389 --> 03:51:38.399 align:start position:0%
practiced in New Hampshire under a
 
03:51:42.110 --> 03:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
temporary order emergency license so how
 
03:51:42.120 --> 03:51:43.750 align:start position:0%
temporary order emergency license so how
does

03:51:43.750 --> 03:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:51:47.110 --> 03:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
um how do these things do these things
 
03:51:50.910 --> 03:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
not sound conflicting to you I'm sorry
 
03:51:53.349 --> 03:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
do these things I missed that last part
 
03:51:55.910 --> 03:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
so sorry the the section A where it says
 
03:51:58.349 --> 03:51:58.359 align:start position:0%
the strike out of the title of this
 
03:52:00.950 --> 03:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
section which is Strikes Out temporary
 
03:52:04.070 --> 03:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
and emergency just talk refers refers it
 
03:52:06.269 --> 03:52:06.279 align:start position:0%
to applicants from other
 
03:52:09.189 --> 03:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
states and then section four of the
 
03:52:13.750 --> 03:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment the very bottom says that uh
 
03:52:16.550 --> 03:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
oplc shall issue a license to practice
 
03:52:18.830 --> 03:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
psychology or school psychology to any
 
03:52:20.670 --> 03:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
individuals who have met the following
 
03:52:22.630 --> 03:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
requirements and it says a the
 
03:52:24.630 --> 03:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
individual is practiced in New Hampshire
 
03:52:27.110 --> 03:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
under a temporary or emergency license
 
03:52:29.389 --> 03:52:29.399 align:start position:0%
for a period of at least 90
 
03:52:32.630 --> 03:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
days where does this refer to a
 
03:52:36.550 --> 03:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
different part of the bill yes said BR
 
03:52:39.550 --> 03:52:39.560 align:start position:0%
if you if you look back on the beginning
 
03:52:43.070 --> 03:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
part Roman one is a person licensed to
 
03:52:45.389 --> 03:52:45.399 align:start position:0%
practice psychology in another
 
03:52:47.910 --> 03:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction can apply for a license and
 
03:52:51.269 --> 03:52:51.279 align:start position:0%
it gives you the requirements for
 
03:52:55.269 --> 03:52:55.279 align:start position:0%
that uh Roman two and that would be
 
03:52:58.429 --> 03:52:58.439 align:start position:0%
temporary lure if you look down there
 
03:52:58.439 --> 03:53:00.790 align:start position:0%
temporary lure if you look down there
under

03:53:00.790 --> 03:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
under
 
03:53:03.389 --> 03:53:03.399 align:start position:0%
1e so this is an individual seeking
 
03:53:03.399 --> 03:53:04.590 align:start position:0%
1e so this is an individual seeking
temporary

03:53:04.590 --> 03:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
03:53:07.510 --> 03:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
license so Roman one is how you get a
 
03:53:10.990 --> 03:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
temporary license number two is a
 
03:53:14.630 --> 03:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
declared person licensed in another
 
03:53:16.910 --> 03:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction providing services and
 
03:53:18.830 --> 03:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
response to declared
 
03:53:21.830 --> 03:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
disaster I see I see excuse me of course
 
03:53:24.590 --> 03:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
okay I get I understand yeah three is a
 
03:53:27.790 --> 03:53:27.800 align:start position:0%
temporary practice is for for somebody
 
03:53:33.149 --> 03:53:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:37.630 --> 03:53:37.640 align:start position:0%
that's it talks about all all of the
 
03:53:43.030 --> 03:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:45.510 --> 03:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair I I was
 
03:53:47.110 --> 03:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
actually going to bring up the same
 
03:53:49.750 --> 03:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
questioning about striking temporary and
 
03:53:53.149 --> 03:53:53.159 align:start position:0%
emergency applicants uh in regards to
 
03:53:56.830 --> 03:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
this so I think with that uh being said
 
03:53:59.030 --> 03:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
I am all
 
03:54:07.870 --> 03:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:07.880 --> 03:54:10.309 align:start position:0%
 
comments

03:54:10.309 --> 03:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
comments
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
answer uh fellows yeah I'm just I'm just
 
03:54:17.030 --> 03:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
kind of confused because I was on the
 
03:54:20.110 --> 03:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for um
 
03:54:24.110 --> 03:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
133 and we discussed the tele medicine
 
03:54:27.630 --> 03:54:27.640 align:start position:0%
part of it but I don't have remember any
 
03:54:30.830 --> 03:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
discussion about what this amendment is
 
03:54:30.840 --> 03:54:32.510 align:start position:0%
discussion about what this amendment is
about

03:54:32.510 --> 03:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:54:35.950 --> 03:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
did did I just forget it or was it
 
03:54:38.630 --> 03:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
discussed in a different subcommittee or
 
03:54:40.990 --> 03:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
what discussed in a different
 
03:54:44.189 --> 03:54:44.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee at the public hearing on
 
03:54:47.750 --> 03:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
133 during this section representative
 
03:54:51.830 --> 03:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
Lindsay oh not representative director
 
03:54:55.750 --> 03:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
Lindsay was saying that this is
 
03:54:58.950 --> 03:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
a they weren't really in support of this
 
03:55:00.389 --> 03:55:00.399 align:start position:0%
because they didn't think it was
 
03:55:03.389 --> 03:55:03.399 align:start position:0%
entirely necessary because their statute
 
03:55:06.790 --> 03:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
already has emergency and temporary
 
03:55:09.110 --> 03:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
licenses which would allow them to do
 
03:55:09.120 --> 03:55:11.110 align:start position:0%
licenses which would allow them to do
tele

03:55:11.110 --> 03:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
tele
 
03:55:13.590 --> 03:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
medicine it was I don't believe that
 
03:55:15.550 --> 03:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
came up during the
 
03:55:20.149 --> 03:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:23.910 --> 03:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
recall so so does the amendment is it
 
03:55:26.590 --> 03:55:26.600 align:start position:0%
tacked on to the end or is it
 
03:55:30.229 --> 03:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
replacing what is now section in the in
 
03:55:35.790 --> 03:55:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:38.790 --> 03:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
12 so I just feel a little uncom
 
03:55:41.510 --> 03:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
comtable that we didn't hear testimony
 
03:55:46.189 --> 03:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
on this amendment at least I
 
03:55:50.950 --> 03:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
didn't another subcommittee did or no no
 
03:55:54.269 --> 03:55:54.279 align:start position:0%
this was a it came out of a private
 
03:55:57.590 --> 03:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
discussion that I was having with the
 
03:55:58.950 --> 03:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
director op
 
03:56:01.990 --> 03:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
PLC because and I asked her what she
 
03:56:04.710 --> 03:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
meant by not thinking section 12 was
 
03:56:06.790 --> 03:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
necessary and she pointed out that they
 
03:56:10.149 --> 03:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
had this and were talking about how many
 
03:56:12.349 --> 03:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
emergency licenses they had and I said
 
03:56:14.790 --> 03:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
well what we really need is a way to get
 
03:56:17.389 --> 03:56:17.399 align:start position:0%
the emergency licenses converted into
 
03:56:17.399 --> 03:56:18.870 align:start position:0%
the emergency licenses converted into
full

03:56:18.870 --> 03:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
full
 
03:56:22.630 --> 03:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
licenses and therefore came up with
 
03:56:25.710 --> 03:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
assignment okay okay thanks you I I
 
03:56:27.790 --> 03:56:27.800 align:start position:0%
understand and and I feel uncomfortable
 
03:56:30.630 --> 03:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
with going ahead with something that's
 
03:56:32.950 --> 03:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
so different that didn't get a public
 
03:56:37.670 --> 03:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:40.429 --> 03:56:40.439 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair so is it my
 
03:56:44.349 --> 03:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:48.269 --> 03:56:48.279 align:start position:0%
amendment replaces section 12
 
03:56:48.279 --> 03:56:52.710 align:start position:0%
amendment replaces section 12
completely

03:56:52.710 --> 03:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:56.070 --> 03:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry that wasn't clear yeah
 
03:56:58.070 --> 03:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
because it just says to include the
 
03:57:04.910 --> 03:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%

to1 I'm
 
04:00:08.469 --> 04:00:08.479 align:start position:0%
impressed uh all right that takes care
 
04:00:13.429 --> 04:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
of the last section of Senate Bill
 
04:00:13.439 --> 04:00:17.670 align:start position:0%
of the last section of Senate Bill
133

04:00:17.670 --> 04:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:21.030 --> 04:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
and M Marling how uh how soon do you
 
04:00:23.269 --> 04:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
think we can get the
 
04:00:26.110 --> 04:00:26.120 align:start position:0%
amendment I think I can have it um
 
04:00:28.389 --> 04:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
cleaned up and sent if if you'd like to
 
04:00:30.910 --> 04:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
review it first I can send it to you um
 
04:00:33.349 --> 04:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
or I can send it directly to OLS I I
 
04:00:35.790 --> 04:00:35.800 align:start position:0%
would have to ask them um how long it
 
04:00:39.110 --> 04:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
would take so much depends on how tied
 
04:00:41.309 --> 04:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
up they are with the budget and and
 
04:00:44.070 --> 04:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
everything else right so probably not
 
04:00:47.149 --> 04:00:47.159 align:start position:0%
today then oh definit I feel confident
 
04:00:50.469 --> 04:00:50.479 align:start position:0%
that it would not be today okay in that
 
04:00:53.630 --> 04:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
case the further schedule is that there
 
04:00:57.269 --> 04:00:57.279 align:start position:0%
are work session scheduled for this
 
04:01:01.790 --> 04:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
coming Thursday the 13th on Senate B
 
04:01:06.030 --> 04:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
155 and is there another one as well
 
04:01:12.030 --> 04:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:16.750 --> 04:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
have 104 and let's see other and
 
04:01:16.760 --> 04:01:19.149 align:start position:0%
have 104 and let's see other and
58

04:01:19.149 --> 04:01:19.159 align:start position:0%
58
 
04:01:22.830 --> 04:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
yes those are so no those are the final
 
04:01:25.389 --> 04:01:25.399 align:start position:0%
work sessions of those and then there is
 
04:01:30.269 --> 04:01:30.279 align:start position:0%
a executive session in the afternoon of
 
04:01:33.790 --> 04:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and I hope we'll be able to vote
 
04:01:37.229 --> 04:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
out all four of these
 
04:01:41.269 --> 04:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
bills what what I have is is 9:30
 
04:01:44.510 --> 04:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on Tuesday the 18th for 58
 
04:01:47.229 --> 04:01:47.239 align:start position:0%
and and Senate Bill 104 and then 10:30
 
04:01:50.550 --> 04:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
executive session is that not I believe
 
04:01:50.560 --> 04:01:52.030 align:start position:0%
executive session is that not I believe
that

04:01:52.030 --> 04:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:01:55.429 --> 04:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
uh I very I'm suggested we make it one
 
04:01:57.189 --> 04:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
o'clock through the executive session
