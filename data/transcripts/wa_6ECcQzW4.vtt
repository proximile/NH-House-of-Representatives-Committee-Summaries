Antiquated and quite frankly insulting
 
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
and it's time that we do away with this
 
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
term and honor the women in blue who are
 
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
out there every day serving us and that
 
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
is all that this bill does is it removes
 
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 align:start position:0%

currently serve as the police chief for
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
the town of New London I'm a lifelong
 
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire I began my law
 
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement career over 18 years ago as
 
00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
a police officer in my hometown of
 
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
Claremont then I moved on to the New
 
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 align:start position:0%
London Police Department in 2016 and
 
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
I've been serving since Chi as Chief
 
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
since March of 2020.
 
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
one day not too long ago I was reading
 
00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
through RSA 105 police officers and
 
00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 align:start position:0%
Watchmen when I Came Upon 105.5 police
 
00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:24.890 align:start position:0%
Watchmen when I Came Upon 105.5 police
matrons

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
matrons
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
and the RSA reads
 
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
quote women may be appointed as police
 
00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 align:start position:0%
matrons and thereupon shall have within
 
00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 align:start position:0%
the limits of the city or town all the
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
powers conferred by law upon constables
 
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
except in relation to the service of
 
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 align:start position:0%
civil process
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
I had read this RSA years ago long
 
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
before I became a police chief and I
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
remember thinking to myself at the time
 
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
that that seems outdated
 
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
but despite my thought of it being
 
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
outdated I didn't feel at the time that
 
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
I was in a position to enact any change
 
00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
fast forward to my more recent reading
 
00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 align:start position:0%
of RSA 105.5 this time as a police chief
 
00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 align:start position:0%
I had a conversation later that night
 
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
with my husband who was also a police
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
chief about police matrons and I
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned to him I thought it should be
 
00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 align:start position:0%
repealed and he encouragingly said to me
 
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
you know you can do something about that
 
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.510 align:start position:0%
you know you can do something about that
now

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
and he was right so I soon reached out
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
to Beth Sargent and I'm honored to be
 
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 align:start position:0%
here today testifying before you in
 
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
support of this uh bill
 
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
um on behalf of myself and the New
 
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of chiefs of
 
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.409 align:start position:0%

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and members of this committee
 
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
this RSA was enacted over 100 years ago
 
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
in 1915 and a lot has happened since
 
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.689 align:start position:0%
in 1915 and a lot has happened since
then

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
over those 100 plus years many many
 
00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.259 align:start position:0%
women have proudly taken the oath
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
honorably worn the badge and bravely
 
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
protected the people of our great state
 
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
in recognition of all the women who came
 
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
before me and my fellow female law
 
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
enforcement colleagues of today I offer
 
00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:55.259 align:start position:0%
my gratitude to them their families and
 
00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
their sacrifices
 
00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
as female law enforcement professionals
 
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 align:start position:0%
we bear many titles in addition to that
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
which is inscribed on our badge
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
wife mother daughter sister friend and
 
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.090 align:start position:0%
wife mother daughter sister friend and
more

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
one title we should not continue to
 
00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
permit in the codified laws of the State
 
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire however is matron
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
the Merriam-Webster definition of matron
 
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 align:start position:0%
as it pertains to a police station is a
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
woman who supervises women or children
 
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
that was indeed the role of women in the
 
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement in our history
 
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
a role in which they fulfilled a
 
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
critical and valuable need in the
 
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
protection of people in our society a
 
00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:35.699 align:start position:0%
role which they should be applauded for
 
00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:37.979 align:start position:0%
however times have changed and New
 
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement has evolved
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
I offer to you Mr chair and members of
 
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
the committee that women in New
 
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement today are
 
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
certainly more than what this outdated
 
00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:50.699 align:start position:0%
statute provides for
 
00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
and so on behalf of myself my fellow
 
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
female law enforcement colleagues and
 
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of chiefs
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
of police we are asking that you repeal
 
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
105 5 as it is an Antiquated statute
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
that can be removed from New Hampshire
 
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
law we ask that Evo ought to pass on
 
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 29. I remain grateful for
 
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
your consideration and appreciative of
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
your time today thank you
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Chief
 
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.969 align:start position:0%
thank you Chief
um

00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:19.129 --> 00:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
just a question I agree with everything
 
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
you said but I have a question regarding
 
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
that role
 
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.589 align:start position:0%
that role
um

00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
are there any currently anyone in the
 
00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:28.259 align:start position:0%
state that you're aware of appointed as
 
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
a matron none that we are aware of we
 
00:08:32.089 --> 00:08:32.099 align:start position:0%
did ask through the New Hampshire
 
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
Association of chiefs of police to all
 
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
the Chiefs in the state if there were
 
00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:38.099 align:start position:0%
any currently serving police matrons and
 
00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:39.659 align:start position:0%
we did not receive any
 
00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:42.419 align:start position:0%
responses that there were and the the
 
00:08:45.889 --> 00:08:45.899 align:start position:0%
historical role would be if a female was
 
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
arrested the matron would search and Etc
 
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
is that is that correct essentially yes
 
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
yes so for departments in the state that
 
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
do not have a female police employee how
 
00:08:59.570 --> 00:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
would they handle that situation much in
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
the same way that I would search a male
 
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
prisoner we are trained at the New
 
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Police Academy on how to
 
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
appropriately search and process someone
 
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
of a different gender and so I suspect
 
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
that in a department that doesn't have
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
female Law Enforcement Officers they
 
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
would revert to their training and how
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
they were taught to search someone again
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
much the same way I search male
 
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
prisoners so the the name
 
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding there's no role for this
 
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
this position not as far as the New
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Chiefs are concerned no okay
 
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your testimony
 
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.030 align:start position:0%

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
this time I opened a public hearing on
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill 38 excuse me Senate bill 38.
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Ryan members of
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Daley frenette
 
00:30:30.769 --> 00:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
and I am the Senate majority caucus
 
00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
director I'm here today to introduce
 
00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:34.740 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 38 FN on behalf of Senator
 
00:30:36.649 --> 00:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
Gannon Senator Gannon is currently in
 
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
the hospital and he regrets not being
 
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
able to be here in person
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
is signed into law Senate bill 38fn
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
would improve RSA 594 colon 14 by
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
amending the procedure for issuing a
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
summons instead of an arrest this bill
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
would authorize law enforcement to issue
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
a summons in lieu of arrest if the
 
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
officer has probable cause to believe
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
the person has committed a misdemeanor
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
or violation
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
for example under current law a person
 
00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
who has failed to renew a dog license
 
00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
has committed a violation
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
even though it is only a violation under
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
RSA 594 colon 14 in its current form
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
arrest is the only option for law
 
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.549 align:start position:0%
arrest is the only option for law
enforcement

00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:31:15.529 --> 00:31:15.539 align:start position:0%
while current law allows a judge to
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
convert an arrest warrant to a summons
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
it is unnecessarily required it
 
00:31:21.049 --> 00:31:21.059 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily requires law enforcement
 
00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
to file with the court resulting in an
 
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
unnecessary use of law enforcement and
 
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
judicial resources
 
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch discussed this bill
 
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
with both the chiefs of police and ACLU
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
and both indicated their support for the
 
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:33.950 align:start position:0%
and both indicated their support for the
bill

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
the Senate Judiciary Committee amended
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
the bills so the statute would not apply
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
if a peace officer has probable cause to
 
00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:40.980 align:start position:0%
believe that a person has committed
 
00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:43.559 align:start position:0%
abuse violated temporary temporary or
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
permanent protective order or violated
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
stalking provisions
 
00:31:48.889 --> 00:31:48.899 align:start position:0%
the bill was unanimously voted ought to
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
pass the amendment on the consent
 
00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
calendar by the Senate
 
00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak today
 
00:31:54.769 --> 00:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
I will defer any questions to Richard

head from the Department of Justice
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
questions more effectively thank you and
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%

00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
wishes to Senator Gannon absolutely well
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Richard head I'm
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
the government Affairs coordinator for
 
00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch Ms Daly said we have
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
spoken with
 
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
ACLU police Chiefs and the DV Coalition
 
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill all I've signed off
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
on the on the language and and this is a
 
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
bill that we've requested and it's it's
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
from our end our perspective a resource
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
issue so we get requests for arrest
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
warrants on
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
events that simply should not be an
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant or the event so for
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
example as Daley said the
 
00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:58.970 align:start position:0%
example as Daley said the
um

00:32:58.970 --> 00:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
there are certain requirements that
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
trigger an obligation under current law
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
to seek an arrest warrant
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
if the event is committed in front of an
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
officer they can arrest
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
if under statutory Provisions if there's
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
a violation of a domestic violence order
 
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
or an otherwise a protective order
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
within a certain number of days a an
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
arrest can occur without a warrant or if
 
00:33:27.889 --> 00:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
there's an immediate risk of concealing
 
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
or destroying evidence an officer can
 
00:33:33.769 --> 00:33:33.779 align:start position:0%
arrest without a warrant but otherwise
 
00:33:36.169 --> 00:33:36.179 align:start position:0%
an arrest warrant is required requires
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
both misdemeanors and violations
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
um so you know if you have an unpaid dog
 
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
license fee and that gets referred to
 
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
law enforcement law enforcement under
 
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
current law would have to get an arrest
 
00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:55.820 align:start position:0%
warrant and then what typically happens
 
00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
is the judge is going to either convert
 
00:34:00.529 --> 00:34:00.539 align:start position:0%
that to a summons or what also sometimes
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
can happen is at the discretion of the
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
officer that arrest warrant is obtained
 
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
but the summons is issued in lieu of the
 
00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.770 align:start position:0%
but the summons is issued in lieu of the
arrest

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:08.780 align:start position:0%
arrest
 
00:34:11.169 --> 00:34:11.179 align:start position:0%
simply as a as
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
based upon the nature of the event that
 
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
is given rise to the to the need for an
 
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
um this is uh a discretionary option
 
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
available to law enforcement it does not
 
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
require summons being issued in in lieu
 
00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:27.589 align:start position:0%
require summons being issued in in lieu
of

00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
um so it's really you know those
 
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
instances where it really does not give
 
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
rise to the obligation and and the
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
record of having received an arrest
 
00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:39.409 align:start position:0%
record of having received an arrest
warrant

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:39.419 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
00:34:41.089 --> 00:34:41.099 align:start position:0%
um and having to to go through the
 
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
arrest process
 
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
um so it is
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
um from the judicial branches
 
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
perspective sort of an unnecessary
 
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
filing that comes before the court an
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
unnecessary use of the of the judicial
 
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
resources when these can really be
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
decisions be that can be made at the law
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement level
 
00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'd be happy to answer
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
any questions uh that the committee may
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
have thank you
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um so what this would do
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
is the criminal complaint would issue
 
00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:17.420 align:start position:0%
upon the writing of the summons versus
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
the way it was now is the criminal
 
00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
complaint would issue because the
 
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
officer had to arrest the person that's
 
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
correct so basically just bypasses that
 
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant stage where they have to
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
petition the court for the arrest
 
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
warrant and allows the the or the the
 
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
criminal complaint to be issued with the
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
summons or as a summons
 
00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
any further um representative salig
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you just clarify
 
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
if if we pass this what are the
 
00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:52.619 align:start position:0%
circumstances where like give maybe a
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
couple of examples of where a warrant
 
00:35:55.849 --> 00:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
would still be required because I'm I'm
 
00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
just trying to discern that from the
 
00:35:58.970 --> 00:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
language and getting caught in my own
 
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
head a warrant could be issued in any of
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
these cases this does not limit the
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
officer's ability to seek and obtain an
 
00:36:08.329 --> 00:36:08.339 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant
 
00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:11.180 align:start position:0%
um this bill is limited in terms of
 
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
providing the discretionary option in
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
only in misdemeanors and violations
 
00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:20.579 align:start position:0%
um and but it it is
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
it is in no way a mandate on on Law
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
Enforcement issue it has a summons but
 
00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
in and of itself it only applies to
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
represent Rhodes
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
oh sorry representative Catherine
 
00:36:37.849 --> 00:36:37.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question I guess I have a
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
concern about that that it's up to the
 
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to make the decision and
 
00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
if there's no guidelines behind that so
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
and so thank you for for pointing that
 
00:36:53.329 --> 00:36:53.339 align:start position:0%
out so there are guidelines it's the
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
same guidelines that one would have for
 
00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
the arrest warrant so the language is
 
00:36:59.810 --> 00:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
still has probable cause to believe that
 
00:37:02.569 --> 00:37:02.579 align:start position:0%
a person has committed and and that
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately is the standard by which the
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
summons would be issued or an arrest
 
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
warrant uh would be issued this simply
 
00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:11.339 align:start position:0%
does it similar to what would happen in
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
a traffic stop you get a summons instead
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
of a an arrest warrant ultimately if
 
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
there is a defense to that that can be
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
raised before a judge to say there was
 
00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
no probable cause for this some for the
 
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
summons to be issued so it doesn't it
 
00:37:28.849 --> 00:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
doesn't take the court out of it it
 
00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
simply eliminates the arrest that go the
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant that would be issued to
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
that that individual where a summons is
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
follow up okay I think I think I
 
00:37:44.569 --> 00:37:44.579 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying however I
 
00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
I guess for me if you have a
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
let me say this
 
00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:58.069 align:start position:0%
let me say this
um

00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
if it's up to their discretion and um
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
a person decides that the law
 
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer decides not to use
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
this method that's in here and therefore
 
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
it has to get a warrant what's the
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
difference what at what point is that
 
00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
decision okay or do you are you going to
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
have documentation for me
 
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
um we do have issues
 
00:38:26.329 --> 00:38:26.339 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement in New Hampshire and
 
00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
and particularly when it comes to people
 
00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:29.099 align:start position:0%
of color
 
00:38:31.849 --> 00:38:31.859 align:start position:0%
and so for me is there going to be any
 
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
documentation you know just to make sure
 
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
that everybody's getting the same type
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
of treatment with this law in place
 
00:38:43.609 --> 00:38:43.619 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question I think
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:50.220 align:start position:0%
we a couple things actually we are
 
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:54.140 align:start position:0%
in in our system working on
 
00:38:58.970 --> 00:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
being able to extract data about
 
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
um individual
 
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
um sex ethnicity
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
personal data that we currently do not
 
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
extract out of our system our diversity
 
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
and inclusion group is trying to work on
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
our data so that we can extract more
 
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
uh drill down a little bit more in terms
 
00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:19.859 align:start position:0%
of information that we have in our
 
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
system we currently either for arrest or
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
summons and and to be clear under the
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
current system you know
 
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
arrest warrants can be converted into a
 
00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
summons it's just done by a judge
 
00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
instead of of the law enforcement
 
00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:34.609 align:start position:0%
instead of of the law enforcement
officer

00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
officer
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
um so then at the if we are able to
 
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
ultimately input data that can can get
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
issued into reports which we're working
 
00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
on the answer to the question will be
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
yes and that is something I think we're
 
00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:50.099 align:start position:0%
very close to being able to start
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
implementing it won't be
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
old data because we don't have that in
 
00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
our current system but as we move
 
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
forward and are collecting more
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
information and more data into our
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
system we'll be able to generate more
 
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
detailed reports that we currently do
 
00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.069 align:start position:0%
detailed reports that we currently do
not

00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
representative janman
 
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.210 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:11.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
as it stands now if a person
 
00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:17.220 align:start position:0%
they have reasonable uh suspicion I'm
 
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
sorry probable cause probable cause
 
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
thank you probable cause then a
 
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor has occurred they have to go
 
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
before a justice of the peace or a
 
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
Justice if it did not incur in front of
 
00:40:31.609 --> 00:40:31.619 align:start position:0%
them yes right 594 10 notwithstanding so
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
they would go to them and they would
 
00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
have to swear out a complaint that that
 
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
judicial officer would
 
00:40:40.609 --> 00:40:40.619 align:start position:0%
assignment and make an arrest warrant
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
that's they would have to request the
 
00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant that's correct so if we
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
pass this bill
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
that would take that third person out of
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
the I think that's what she was getting
 
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
at it takes that third person out of the
 
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
equation so it doesn't take that I mean
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't so thank you for the question
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take the the judge out of the
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
equation it changes when the judge
 
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
becomes involved in the equation so the
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
judge is always going to be reviewing
 
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
that complaint when it becomes before
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
them and the standard is still the same
 
00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:17.420 align:start position:0%
so there's there's simply the the
 
00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
imposition of an arrest warrant may not
 
00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
happen in that first instance but at the
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
end of the day the nature and quality of
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
the decision making of the of the
 
00:41:29.329 --> 00:41:29.339 align:start position:0%
arresting officer of the the charging
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
officer still on gets judicial review
 
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
if I could just just for the committee
 
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
um there seems to be a lot of confusion
 
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
um currently a police officer can only
 
00:41:44.089 --> 00:41:44.099 align:start position:0%
apply for an arrest warrant
 
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
there's no choice
 
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
now this bill proposes to let the police
 
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
officers say this is a dog license
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
violation or an overdue library book let
 
00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
me just write a summons to the person it
 
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
goes to the court instead of the officer
 
00:42:01.849 --> 00:42:01.859 align:start position:0%
going to the court in the beginning and
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
getting an arrest warrant that's all
 
00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:06.740 align:start position:0%
that this does it gives an option
 
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
and and just don't follow up on that you
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
know much like with with a speeding
 
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
ticket speeding summons you know that
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
happens to happen in front of the
 
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
officer but that is
 
00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
you know still able to be and is
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
reviewed and and by the by a judge
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
I think as a follow-up the question I
 
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
would have for you is uh you're
 
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:28.740 align:start position:0%
releasing the person
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
on a summons in lieu of arrest and I'm
 
00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
reading the form that we're proposing
 
00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
here that the court be using and it says
 
00:42:38.329 --> 00:42:38.339 align:start position:0%
the form is actually the current form
 
00:42:41.089 --> 00:42:41.099 align:start position:0%
that's that's not new in this bill okay
 
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
I'm familiar with unfortunately but it
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
says pending appearance as described
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
here in you shall remain of good
 
00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:50.339 align:start position:0%
behavior so in lieu of bailing them from
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
an arrest you're going to be basically
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
putting the same condition on them under
 
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
the the uh
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
summons how are we keeping track that
 
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
they're released on the summons if
 
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
they're interacted with by a police
 
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
officer at a further date
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
in in much the same way as as currently
 
00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:12.849 align:start position:0%
in in much the same way as as currently
once

00:43:12.849 --> 00:43:12.859 align:start position:0%
once
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
in in terms of of the
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
behavior of the individual if they are
 
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
again before law enforcement officer and
 
00:43:23.809 --> 00:43:23.819 align:start position:0%
the in for in the law enforcement
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
officers aware they've been issued a
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
summons and they have this obligation
 
00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
um you know he would follow essentially
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
the same course whether whether it's
 
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
good or bad it wouldn't
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change sort of the obligation
 
00:43:38.569 --> 00:43:38.579 align:start position:0%
on the individual with on our end we
 
00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
probably need to make sure our forms our
 
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
summons forms and our our charging forms
 
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:52.849 --> 00:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit confused about the the
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
words that have been omitted here just
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
based on the description that we've had
 
00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
of what the current status is
 
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
and it originally said the law
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
originally said in any case which it is
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh to arrest without a warrant
 
00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
so it seems like there's a you could
 
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
arrest without a warrant and you could
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
do a summons maybe I I just don't
 
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
understand it is the important thing
 
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
that part of the bill
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
or is the important thing the part of
 
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
the bill down here when it where it puts
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
in all these references to other other
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
laws is that is that the important part
 
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
or equally important or
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
so you could straighten that out for me
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question and I
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate it so under current law
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
in in the way as you as you noted it
 
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
reads in any case in which it is lawful
 
00:44:59.690 --> 00:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
for a peace officer to arrest without a
 
00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.370 align:start position:0%
for a peace officer to arrest without a
warrant

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on
 
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.690 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on
um

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:08.569 --> 00:45:08.579 align:start position:0%
for misdemeanor or violation
 
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
under current law this gets triggered so
 
00:45:14.809 --> 00:45:14.819 align:start position:0%
the ability to only issue a summons
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
instead of an arrest warrant has to meet
 
00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
the criteria for when it is otherwise
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
lawful for an officer to do that and
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
that standard is laid out in a different
 
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.210 align:start position:0%
that standard is laid out in a different
statute

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
um under RSA 54410 it lays out the
 
00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:32.220 align:start position:0%
criteria for when an officer can issue a
 
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
summons instead of a a a warrant for an
 
00:45:38.329 --> 00:45:38.339 align:start position:0%
arrest and really under with with the
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
section that's being amended for is is
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
the summons form
 
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.609 align:start position:0%
the summons form
so

00:45:43.609 --> 00:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
there are essentially three
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
primary reasons why a undercurrent law
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
an officer can issue a summons instead
 
00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
of an arrest warrant one is if the crime
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
occurs or the violation occurs in front
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the officer then the officer can
 
00:46:02.569 --> 00:46:02.579 align:start position:0%
issue a summons instead of a an arrest
 
00:46:02.579 --> 00:46:03.650 align:start position:0%
issue a summons instead of a an arrest
warrant

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:03.660 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
second is if it's a domestic violence or
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
protective order violation if it occurs
 
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
within a certain period of time
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
a uh a summons can be issued instead of
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
an arrest warrant
 
00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
um and then and then the third one is
 
00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:22.970 align:start position:0%
um and then and then the third one is
um

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
uh actually I forgot about the third oh
 
00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
if if the if the officer has information
 
00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
probably cause to believe that
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
um there will be the evidence will be
 
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
destroyed if the time is necessary to go
 
00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
off and seek an arrest warrant
 
00:46:41.089 --> 00:46:41.099 align:start position:0%
so take my example of the dog license
 
00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
the dog license is a violation failure
 
00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
to pay your dog license fee is a
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
violation it does not occur in front of
 
00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
the officer so under current law the uh
 
00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
standard that's that's crossed out where
 
00:46:58.970 --> 00:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
it says it is lawful for a police
 
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
officer to arrest without a warrant it
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
did not happen in front of the officer
 
00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
so it is not lawful under current law
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
for the officer to issue a summons in
 
00:47:11.089 --> 00:47:11.099 align:start position:0%
lieu of an arrest warrant what this bill
 
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
does is says
 
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
it strikes that language and says that a
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
an officer can issue a summons in lieu
 
00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
of an arrest warrant if they have
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe a misdemeanor
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
or a violation has occurred
 
00:47:28.609 --> 00:47:28.619 align:start position:0%
so it it really takes out that
 
00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
in a very sort of low level event
 
00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
the obligation under current law of an
 
00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
officer to get an arrest warrant for
 
00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
that individual who is not paid their
 
00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
their dog license fee
 
00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:45.740 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
so it it more or less has the same
 
00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
standards and everything and it just
 
00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
makes it simpler and more efficient
 
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
maybe would that be uh a good estimate
 
00:47:58.490 --> 00:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
of what it is it is the same standard
 
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
probable cause is still required for the
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
officer to issue the the summons is
 
00:48:08.329 --> 00:48:08.339 align:start position:0%
simply is it reduces if so for example I
 
00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
have on occasion not paid my dog license
 
00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
fee on time if I were to get an arrest
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
warrant for that I think most people
 
00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
would be pretty shocked that they're
 
00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
getting an arrest they're getting
 
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
arrested for failure to pay a dog
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
license fee they would expect something
 
00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
along lines of a summons and I think
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
that's really what we're trying to
 
00:48:26.569 --> 00:48:26.579 align:start position:0%
address in this rather than an officer
 
00:48:28.609 --> 00:48:28.619 align:start position:0%
coming to the judge the judge then
 
00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
having to say if that's not what we need
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
to do we need to issue a summons and
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
authorize the summons it just reduces
 
00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
that judicial resource need but does not
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
eliminate at the end of the day the the
 
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:43.640 align:start position:0%
judge's review of the actual complaint
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that explanation
 
00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
represent Stone
 
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear there's still be a
 
00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
requirement that a probable cause
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
affidavit is valuable with the court
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
even though our summons is issued they
 
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
would not issue an affidavit it would be
 
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
described in the summons what what the
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
event was and then ultimately when the
 
00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
judge is reviewing that summons in the
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
context of the substance of it they
 
00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
would be determining whether or not
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
there was probable cause for that
 
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
summons to be issued
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
so it's not an affidavit at the time of
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
the summons the summons uh lays out the
 
00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
facts and actually the complaint plays
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
out the facts sorry
 
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
um and that ultimately gets reviewed by
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
the judge but the but a separate sort of
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
um uh affidavit like you get with a a
 
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
request for a an arrest warrant is it's
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
just a different document but the the
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
review is still the same at the end of
 
00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
the day
 
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you Mr
 
00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:47.510 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you Mr
chairman

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you attorney head I'm just a
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
little bit confused about the bill
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
itself as well and I'm wondering if
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
there's any concrete examples that you
 
00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
have of this happening where an officer
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
has to arrest someone for a violation
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know the dog catcher example has
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
that happened before and
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
um it it has
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
um the another one would be
 
00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
um a kid who takes an ATV out and
 
00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
trespasses on someone's property
 
00:50:17.089 --> 00:50:17.099 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
just gets picked up for that
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
um it's it's along those lines that
 
00:50:26.809 --> 00:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:31.089 --> 00:50:31.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
I'd appreciate it if you could maybe
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
walk me through how
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
this law
 
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have potential to create
 
00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:46.849 align:start position:0%
doesn't have potential to create
um

00:50:46.849 --> 00:50:46.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
a a level of disparity uh between let's
 
00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
say officers in one community may kind
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
of get together and decide okay we're
 
00:50:58.490 --> 00:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
only going to treat this particular type
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
of crime or violation uh that we're just
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
going to issue with summons for that or
 
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
is in another Community for exactly the
 
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
same crime officers could say no I think
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
we'll do you know we'll have to issue an
 
00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant I think the guidelines in
 
00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
the in the bill are pretty clear for
 
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
things like stocking violations but
 
00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
there seems to be an incredible amount
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
of discretion and I guess in your
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
opinion are we opening the door to
 
00:51:28.319 --> 00:51:29.210 align:start position:0%
opinion are we opening the door to
um

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:29.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:31.140 align:start position:0%
treating people in different communities
 
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
in different ways for the same crime
 
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question I think as
 
00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
a practical matter
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
some of this may not change anything
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
because sometimes in a in just been
 
00:51:46.609 --> 00:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
related to judge king that sometimes the
 
00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:48.500 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant is obtained
 
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
because that's the requirement but a
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
summons it's ultimately
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
you know the person is contacted and
 
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
they said come down and get your summons
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
um it is simply in terms of
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
what why we brought it Forward is it
 
00:52:05.329 --> 00:52:05.339 align:start position:0%
eliminates sort of the judicial resource
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
step of getting a an arrest warrant
 
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
where uh is simply is clearly not needed
 
00:52:11.089 --> 00:52:11.099 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of of
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
you know you you've heard plenty of
 
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
testimony from law enforcement that you
 
00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
know the the issue of repeat offenders
 
00:52:26.809 --> 00:52:26.819 align:start position:0%
is is a concern for them we're not
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
talking about that type of situation
 
00:52:31.609 --> 00:52:31.619 align:start position:0%
we're talking about low-level offenses
 
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:34.140 align:start position:0%
where an officer
 
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
it simply has no they recognize that the
 
00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:40.970 align:start position:0%
it simply has no they recognize that the
the

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
person receiving an arrest warrant in
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
that circumstance is
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
is an excessive event for for the nature
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
of the the crime or violation that has
 
00:52:51.119 --> 00:52:52.549 align:start position:0%
of the the crime or violation that has
occurred

00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
um and and I think as a practical matter
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
it may not change at the end of the day
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
what that person is receiving where law
 
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
enforcement currently may be getting an
 
00:53:03.049 --> 00:53:03.059 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant
 
00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:04.859 align:start position:0%
um and it's either getting converted by
 
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
a judge to a summons or they're simply
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
issuing a summons at the time uh instead
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
of of an arrest
 
00:53:14.569 --> 00:53:14.579 align:start position:0%
um so as a practical matter I'm not sure
 
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
it would change anything I think you
 
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
know if there is concern over time that
 
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
that there is a disparity occurring we
 
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:24.780 align:start position:0%
obviously can be Revisited but in terms
 
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
of our experience now it is simply you
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
know those events where it is
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
it would be truly shocking for the
 
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
individual to receive an arrest warrant
 
00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
when they would expect to see something
 
00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
more along the lines of a traffic
 
00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:41.750 align:start position:0%
more along the lines of a traffic
violation

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
violation
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
a attorney ahead if you could indulge me
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
for a second
 
00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
just for so everyone understands
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
currently the officer doesn't have
 
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of questions about officer
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
discretion if if an officer is referred
 
00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
a case from the uh from the town says
 
00:53:59.930 --> 00:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
this person hasn't paid their dog
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
license in three years the officer has
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
no choice but to apply for an arrest
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
warrant at this point is that is that
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
correct at that point the officer has
 
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe a violation
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
has occurred same thing that would occur
 
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
under this bill so he but he has no
 
00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
options it's the only way to get that
 
00:54:17.569 --> 00:54:17.579 align:start position:0%
person to court is an arrest warrant
 
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
application is that correct yeah that is
 
00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
correct so the absolutely under current
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
law law enforcement has to come to court
 
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
seek an arrest warrant
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
um as a practical matter once they've
 
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
obtained that warrant they've complied
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
and they may issue a summons at that
 
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
point but but the arrest warrant is
 
00:54:35.809 --> 00:54:35.819 align:start position:0%
still required and that arrest warrant
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
now is on that individuals record in
 
00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
terms of the court record so the officer
 
00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:44.220 align:start position:0%
goes to the court for the dog license
 
00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
issue applies an arrest warrant because
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's what he has to do and the court
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
at that point can look at it and
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
probably will look at it and say no you
 
00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
can have a summons because we're not
 
00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
arresting people for dog licenses today
 
00:55:00.049 --> 00:55:00.059 align:start position:0%
what this does is lets the officer
 
00:55:02.089 --> 00:55:02.099 align:start position:0%
instead of having to go to court
 
00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
to get an arrest warrant because that's
 
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:05.700 align:start position:0%
all he can do is he can write out a
 
00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
summons to give the person which is what
 
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
the judge would have done anyway exactly
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you and and
 
00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
um and and at the end of the day
 
00:55:17.809 --> 00:55:17.819 align:start position:0%
that summons and the complaint that goes
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
without summons is going to be reviewed
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
by a judge just now doesn't have to be
 
00:55:22.849 --> 00:55:22.859 align:start position:0%
done twice
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
thank you enough for the questions then
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else is there anyone
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
else listen to testify on this bill who
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
has not testified on this bill
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
public hearing house uh Senate bill 38.
 
00:55:42.049 --> 00:55:42.059 align:start position:0%
committee will be in recess for five
 
00:55:42.059 --> 00:56:01.190 align:start position:0%
committee will be in recess for five
minutes

00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
all these um conversations in this bowl
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
has to do with intimate Partners
 
00:56:07.319 --> 00:56:09.470 align:start position:0%
has to do with intimate Partners
stalking

and I am the prime sponsor of Senate
 
01:02:10.849 --> 01:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
Bill 182 which is the relative to the

definition of way in driving or
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%

or liquor
 
01:02:18.049 --> 01:02:18.059 align:start position:0%
um this bill was a request from the
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
dairy police chief based on a decision
 
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:22.920 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire Division of Motor Vehicles

which left a hole in the DUI laws with
 
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
regard to the definition of way simply
 
01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
this what this bill does is it extends
 
01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
the definition way to seven additional
 
01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.089 align:start position:0%

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Scott Jordan I
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
work for the dairy Police Department as
 
01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
a prosecutor I've been doing this for
 
01:04:06.049 --> 01:04:06.059 align:start position:0%
about 35 years I was a full-time police
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
officer before going to law school and I
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
prosecuted basically that entire time as
 
01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:13.140 align:start position:0%
a police prosecutor and as a assistant
 
01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
County attorney Deputy County attorney
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
and I work for the town of Darius their
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
supervising prosecutor
 
01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.890 align:start position:0%
supervising prosecutor
the

01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
what happened was last year the New
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court in this case
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's Diana Rutter versus I believe it's
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Motor Vehicles the
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:43.799 align:start position:0%
part together
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
because of the language of 259 125
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
which is the definition of way in the
 
01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire now there's two
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
parts to weigh the first part is very
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
generic and it applies to almost all
 
01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle offenses
 
01:05:05.329 --> 01:05:05.339 align:start position:0%
the second part part two is an expanded
 
01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:07.140 align:start position:0%
definition of way
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
in an encompassed four rsas and that's
 
01:05:13.569 --> 01:05:13.579 align:start position:0%
the only four that were listed in it
 
01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
encompassed DWI
 
01:05:17.809 --> 01:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
aggravated DWI
 
01:05:20.569 --> 01:05:20.579 align:start position:0%
it was a parking system for emergency
 
01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
parking by the Department of
 
01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
Transportation by the commissioner to
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
put in certain signage that one is
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
265.79 which is reckless operation
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
so the ones that we're dealing with
 
01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
primarily is the DW to 2dwis the
 
01:05:42.289 --> 01:05:42.299 align:start position:0%
aggravated DWI and regular DWI now in
 
01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
the case of involving Miss Rutter the
 
01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruled that
 
01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:51.740 align:start position:0%
since the ALS statute
 
01:05:56.569 --> 01:05:56.579 align:start position:0%
265 at 265-a colon 4 and the other
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
enumerated ones that we've listed I
 
01:06:01.809 --> 01:06:01.819 align:start position:0%
believe 21 and 31. are not included
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
directly in the definition of way like
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
the DWI statute and they don't apply
 
01:06:12.349 --> 01:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
so as such in this case a woman who was
 
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
arrested for drunk driving in a church
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
parking lot
 
01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
did not face the ALS the administrative
 
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
license suspension rules
 
01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
so in other words the obligation to
 
01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
consent to blood
 
01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
the penalties for refusing or testing
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
over do not apply
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
so basically what happens is and I
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
remember when we started making these
 
01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:43.799 align:start position:0%
arrests in 1991-92 under the ALS
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
and DWI have been married at the hip for
 
01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
over 30 years
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
and now they've been separated
 
01:06:54.770 --> 01:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
now in this order and I'd have you all
 
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
read the last page of this order
 
01:07:00.529 --> 01:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
it was an invitation by Justice Marconi
 
01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
Hans mccorny excuse me
 
01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:06.299 align:start position:0%
who said this is how we can correct it
 
01:07:09.289 --> 01:07:09.299 align:start position:0%
simply by adding it and the legislature
 
01:07:11.089 --> 01:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
took this as a Judicial oversight and
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
they're giving the opportunity to have
 
01:07:13.849 --> 01:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
it corrected and that's what we're
 
01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
asking you to do we're not asking for
 
01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
anything new
 
01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
we're asking just to be returned back to
 
01:07:21.049 --> 01:07:21.059 align:start position:0%
the last 30 years of how we've been
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
doing business and the fact that DWIs
 
01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
and ALS run hand in hand
 
01:07:30.529 --> 01:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
and it's basically making this separate
 
01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
now depending on where you're arrested
 
01:07:35.569 --> 01:07:35.579 align:start position:0%
what road you're arrested on is it a
 
01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
private road is it a private parking lot
 
01:07:41.329 --> 01:07:41.339 align:start position:0%
if so ALS won't apply
 
01:07:44.089 --> 01:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
and it it's disparaging or not
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
disparaging but it gives a
 
01:07:50.089 --> 01:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
um uneven executive very even-handed and
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
go across the Spectrum when it came to
 
01:07:56.450 --> 01:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
o thank you
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
the defendant was subject to the oui
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
laws just not the administration section
 
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
of it is that correct correct she
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
appealed the
 
01:08:10.799 --> 01:08:11.630 align:start position:0%
appealed the
um

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
the imposition of the ALS suspension for
 
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
testing over
 
01:08:18.769 --> 01:08:18.779 align:start position:0%
and the Supreme Court ruled that it
 
01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
should not have been applied to her
 
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
so going forward if we're If This Were
 
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
to pass well actually presently someone
 
01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
could be arrested for the oui
 
01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:31.849 align:start position:0%
could be arrested for the oui
um

01:08:31.849 --> 01:08:31.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:33.769 --> 01:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
found guilty
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
based on the observations of the officer
 
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
and they refused the the breath test and
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
the blood tests
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
they can't lose their license for that
 
01:08:45.769 --> 01:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
but they can lose it for the oui is that
 
01:08:45.779 --> 01:08:46.630 align:start position:0%
but they can lose it for the oui is that
correct

01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
correct but if you remember the ALS is
 
01:08:53.150 --> 01:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
an intermarine intermediate remedy right
 
01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
it's an immediate remedy in regards to
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
the DWI if a person is arrested and they
 
01:08:59.570 --> 01:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
refuse to take a test
 
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
in 30 days their driver's license will
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
be suspended by the Department of Motor
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
Vehicles now they have a right to have a
 
01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
hearing and have due process regards to
 
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
that but a DWI arrest
 
01:09:12.289 --> 01:09:12.299 align:start position:0%
it can take a year way we're doing
 
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
covert I've got DWIs right now pending
 
01:09:17.809 --> 01:09:17.819 align:start position:0%
that a three years old Plus
 
01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
because of the backlog in the court so
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a drunken driver
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
who's arrested by the police charged and
 
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
if this case had been in place
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
they could still have their driver's
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
license with no penalties whatsoever for
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
three years
 
01:09:33.789 --> 01:09:33.799 align:start position:0%
and that's what the legislature in
 
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
1991-92 was trying to avoid and put in
 
01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:37.610 align:start position:0%
1991-92 was trying to avoid and put in
place

01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
a way of getting these people off the
 
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
representative pru
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
so that three-year-old case
 
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
the person gets his license suspended in
 
01:09:54.289 --> 01:09:54.299 align:start position:0%
30 days which is still suspended for
 
01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
three years because you haven't had a
 
01:09:59.630 --> 01:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
hearing no sir the ALS has its own
 
01:10:01.729 --> 01:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
separate and distinct penalties
 
01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
so if a person refuses to take a test
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
and this is the first time
 
01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
they lose their driver's license for a
 
01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
period of six months
 
01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
now if they're convicted of the DWI the
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
DWI sentence would go on top of that
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's a penalty for refusal it's going
 
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
to be consecutive
 
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
however if they took a test and they're
 
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
convicted of the DWI then they're still
 
01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
going to lose if they tested over 0.08
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
they're going to lose their license for
 
01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
six months under the ALS however
 
01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
that six-month penalty will run
 
01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:35.699 align:start position:0%
concurrent so at the same time as any
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
penalty that the Court gives them for a
 
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
license suspension and if it's say that
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
DWI is two years out now and you did the
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
six months up front then that six months
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
will be credited towards that any
 
01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
suspension that the Court gives them
 
01:10:53.209 --> 01:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
 
01:10:56.689 --> 01:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:59.090 --> 01:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
 
01:10:59.100 --> 01:10:59.689 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
um

01:10:59.689 --> 01:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
I believe the Supreme Court decision
 
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
said that they
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
um don't know and can't speak to the
 
01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
legislature's intent in structuring the
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
law in this way
 
01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
is it do you know what the legislative
 
01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
intent was I haven't had the opportunity
 
01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
to look back that far in the rsas yet
 
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
is it possible that it was maybe a
 
01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
fourth amendment consideration
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
considering that it's private property
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so no because the I'm
 
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't believe so
 
01:11:35.770 --> 01:11:35.780 align:start position:0%
um the current DWI legislation which
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
current one provides for that expanded
 
01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.250 align:start position:0%
current one provides for that expanded
definition

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
that makes no sense where they were
 
01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
plugging in the ALS to be a stopgap
 
01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
method to get people off the road it
 
01:11:48.169 --> 01:11:48.179 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense they wouldn't
 
01:11:50.209 --> 01:11:50.219 align:start position:0%
have included that included that and if
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
you read Heinz Marconi's descent you'll
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
see that that's exactly what she's
 
01:11:57.169 --> 01:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
stating in her descent that these it's
 
01:11:58.729 --> 01:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
implied and the legislature says we're
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
not going to take it as implied I'm
 
01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
sorry not the legislature but the the
 
01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
overall Court we're not going to take it
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
as implied if it's not written
 
01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
and it's very in fact or um the court is
 
01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
only looking at what is written in the
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
law there's only four statutes so
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
they're saying we can't interpret this
 
01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you in practice
 
01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
that the ALS for the last 30 years has
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
been married to the DWI and there's
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
never been a question about it the
 
01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
police prosecutors as well as defense
 
01:12:35.209 --> 01:12:35.219 align:start position:0%
attorneys and the Judiciary have always
 
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
agreed up until this last case that ALS
 
01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
and DWI go hand in hand no matter where
 
01:12:44.689 --> 01:12:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
thanks for letting me ask another
 
01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.750 align:start position:0%
thanks for letting me ask another
question

01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
um I remember a little bit of what I
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
read in the um majority opinion on this
 
01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
case and I remember that they said that
 
01:12:59.689 --> 01:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
there are situations in which you might
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
have administrative license suspension
 
01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
without a DUI and situations in which
 
01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
you might have a DUI without ALS
 
01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:10.140 align:start position:0%
can you speak to what kinds of
 
01:13:11.689 --> 01:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
situations those would be because I
 
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
think that was the Court's reasoning in
 
01:13:16.370 --> 01:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
supporting overturning the conviction
 
01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
they basically they're saying they're
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
not married at the hip
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
well I I don't believe the court said
 
01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:24.950 align:start position:0%
well I I don't believe the court said
that

01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
um where there are situations and they
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
don't talk about them in the in the
 
01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:29.209 align:start position:0%
don't talk about them in the in the
order

01:13:29.209 --> 01:13:29.219 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
and the only one that really comes to
 
01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
mind is the person who tests positive
 
01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
for drugs because we don't have a level
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
of drugs so if the person the blood
 
01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
comes back that the person's under the
 
01:13:42.169 --> 01:13:42.179 align:start position:0%
influence of drugs
 
01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
then no Ayla ALS goes into play because
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
they didn't test over a 0.08
 
01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
which is only for the alcohol we don't
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
have levels on drugs and as such there
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
is no implied consent
 
01:13:59.330 --> 01:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
penalty that's applied however the still
 
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
the ALS rights are read to them like the
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
fact that refusal is going to be used
 
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
against you in a court of law all those
 
01:14:08.209 --> 01:14:08.219 align:start position:0%
rights are still in play and they're
 
01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
still given to the person
 
01:14:13.729 --> 01:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
but that's the only one I know of
 
01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
um would one of the cases be a junior
 
01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
operator perhaps where they're not
 
01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
allowed to have any alcohol in their
 
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
system where it would cause an
 
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
administrative suspension
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
for a person under the age of 21 it's a
 
01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:29.450 align:start position:0%
for a person under the age of 21 it's a
0.02

01:14:29.450 --> 01:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
0.02
 
01:14:32.209 --> 01:14:32.219 align:start position:0%
if they test above a 0.02 not have to
 
01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:33.900 align:start position:0%
just smell alcohol in their breath if
 
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
they test above a 0.02 then their
 
01:14:38.689 --> 01:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
driver's license will be suspended for
 
01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
that six-month period for a first
 
01:14:40.739 --> 01:14:42.350 align:start position:0%
that six-month period for a first
offense

01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
offense
 
01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:45.900 align:start position:0%
I represent go ahead
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm just trying to parse out kind of
 
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
the reasoning of why way would be
 
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
different and if I could just give you a
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
scenario and you tell me if this would
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
apply so
 
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm home it's the summer it's
 
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
beautiful weather we're all barbecuing
 
01:14:59.209 --> 01:14:59.219 align:start position:0%
in my backyard right
 
01:15:00.649 --> 01:15:00.659 align:start position:0%
um my son wants to play basketball he's
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
got a couple of friends who came over
 
01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
now in order for him to play basketball
 
01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
I have to back up the car 15 feet so he
 
01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:06.780 align:start position:0%
can get to the basketball hoop and
 
01:15:08.090 --> 01:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
things like that well I've had a couple
 
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
of drinks because I'm barbecuing at my
 
01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
house I'm in my own driveway if I back
 
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
up that you know 10 to 15 feet or
 
01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
whatever and I am confronted would that
 
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
be a situation where this doesn't apply
 
01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
now and would apply if we implemented
 
01:15:23.689 --> 01:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
this law um this wouldn't apply now and
 
01:15:25.490 --> 01:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't apply if you amend the
 
01:15:28.010 --> 01:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
statue just like DWI wouldn't apply for
 
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
you in your driveway either okay the
 
01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
amended the extended definition of way
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
which DWI falls under does not cover
 
01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
private driveways it's private parking
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
lots that are designed for the public
 
01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
other people come in in other words it's
 
01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
not just designed for the family this is
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
my private parking lot in my house
 
01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
that's a driveway and uh DWI there's
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
nothing in the way statute that would
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
ever cover that property okay thank you
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
represent Baldwin one more
 
01:15:59.450 --> 01:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
last one unless you keep being
 
01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:01.189 align:start position:0%
last one unless you keep being
interesting

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
um apartment building complex parking
 
01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.270 align:start position:0%
um apartment building complex parking
lot

01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
lot
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
apartment building complexes are covered
 
01:16:09.649 --> 01:16:09.659 align:start position:0%
under the statute that is not a driveway
 
01:16:11.810 --> 01:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
that is open to the public not only are
 
01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
the tenants allowed there but anyone
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
visiting the tenants you have uh
 
01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
children who go out and play in that
 
01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
area so yes those are covered currently
 
01:16:22.729 --> 01:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
under the DWI law and they wouldn't be
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
covered technically under the ALS given
 
01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
that here uh given rudder
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
so we would look to put that back under
 
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.810 --> 01:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:16:39.169 --> 01:16:39.179 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
so I'm just a little confused about what
 
01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
the way the the law is
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
it says an act it's relative to the
 
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
definition of way
 
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
in driving under the influence of drugs
 
01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
and liquor
 
01:16:56.209 --> 01:16:56.219 align:start position:0%
so but I when I look at the current law
 
01:16:58.130 --> 01:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
as written it has way in there and I
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
don't see anything in the bill that has
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the definition of
 
01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.290 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the definition of
way

01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
I just see that the change that is made
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
in the law
 
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
is just to add the three rsas that you
 
01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:14.390 align:start position:0%
is just to add the three rsas that you
mentioned

01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm just curious is it the
 
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
definition of way or is it just that you
 
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
want that this bill intends to
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
incorporate a the ALS laws
 
01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:27.110 align:start position:0%
incorporate a the ALS laws
with

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:30.060 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what with Waze
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
the the change that we're looking for is
 
01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
within the words and phrases and the
 
01:17:36.649 --> 01:17:36.659 align:start position:0%
definition of way
 
01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
they Define they expand the definition
 
01:17:42.649 --> 01:17:42.659 align:start position:0%
of way and it says for the purposes
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
of these statutes this is going to be
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
the definition of way
 
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
so all we're asking for is there are
 
01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:51.830 align:start position:0%
so all we're asking for is there are
currently

01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
one two three four statutes that are in
 
01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:55.970 align:start position:0%
one two three four statutes that are in
there

01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:17:58.610 --> 01:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
the current definition of way
 
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
or the the current definition of way
 
01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
under section two is the definition for
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
these statutes
 
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
so for DWI aggravated DWI and for
 
01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
reckless operation and for that parking
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
statute the expanded definition of way
 
01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
is applicable to those statutes
 
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
and it's always been applicable to ALS
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
until this court order
 
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
all we're asking is that you put that
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
back inside the definition of way under
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
two and be applicable to the
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
administrative license suspension and
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's what those three rsas involve
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
the ones that are added on to the end
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
right I understand the ALS but I I just
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
don't understand there's a definite I
 
01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
mean there's no other definitions at all
 
01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
and there's no definitions in here are
 
01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
there definitions excuse me for the
 
01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:51.250 align:start position:0%
there definitions excuse me for the
follow-up

01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:51.260 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
is the definition in the three rsas that
 
01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:57.659 align:start position:0%
you where exactly is the definition of
 
01:18:57.659 --> 01:18:58.370 align:start position:0%
you where exactly is the definition of
way

01:18:58.370 --> 01:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
the definition of way is within the
 
01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
statute we're looking to amend if you
 
01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
read past the three rsas it says any
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
public Highway Street Avenue Road alley
 
01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
Park parking lot or Parkway any private
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
way laid out under authority of Statute
 
01:19:14.689 --> 01:19:14.699 align:start position:0%
ways provided and maintained by public
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
institutions to which state funds are
 
01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
appropriated for public use any
 
01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
privately owned and maintained Way open
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
for public use any private parking lots
 
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
including parking lots and other
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
out-of-door areas of commercial
 
01:19:32.209 --> 01:19:32.219 align:start position:0%
establishments which are generally
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
maintained for the benefit of the public
 
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:36.300 align:start position:0%
so that is the definition the expanded
 
01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
definition of way under section two of
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
the definition of way
 
01:19:45.649 --> 01:19:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony you're
 
01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:50.630 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony you're
welcome

01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
you want this
 
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
I just
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
could I uh with your permission Mr chair
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to have uh our prosecutor
 
01:20:12.649 --> 01:20:12.659 align:start position:0%
stay up here for a few more minutes
 
01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
um so Mr chair members of the committee
 
01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
my name is Joe hubecki I'm the immediate
 
01:20:17.810 --> 01:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
past president of the New Hampshire
 
01:20:20.810 --> 01:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
Chiefs of police and I'm also the chief
 
01:20:23.810 --> 01:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
of police in Hollis I speak today and
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
supported this legislation and I urge
 
01:20:29.330 --> 01:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
you the committee uh to pass this to
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
give you some historical perspective in
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
August of 2022 I received an email from
 
01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
a concerned Chief so happens to be your
 
01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
boss about this Statute in some
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies with the definition of a
 
01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:45.130 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies with the definition of a
way

01:20:45.130 --> 01:20:45.140 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
I think this is an important and
 
01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
necessary change I won't reiterate and
 
01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
I'll keep my remarks brief anything uh
 
01:20:56.570 --> 01:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
what my colleague here has mentioned but
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
I I do think it's important to reiterate
 
01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
the fact that within the Supreme Court
 
01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:04.970 align:start position:0%
the fact that within the Supreme Court
ruling

01:21:04.970 --> 01:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
ruling
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
the the final paragraph of the order
 
01:21:07.199 --> 01:21:08.990 align:start position:0%
the the final paragraph of the order
says

01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:21:12.530 --> 01:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
um that our legislator has sought to
 
01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
close various loopholes and get tough on
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
DUI uh by making
 
01:21:21.649 --> 01:21:21.659 align:start position:0%
um changes to uh DUI Law and I think
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's a important to remember here and
 
01:21:25.490 --> 01:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate given the fact that
 
01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:27.659 align:start position:0%
last year alone there were 134 traffic
 
01:21:29.930 --> 01:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
fatalities in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:33.719 align:start position:0%
in between 2009 and 2018 which is the
 
01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
most recent data I could find provided
 
01:21:38.830 --> 01:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
by the CDC there were roughly 354
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
fatalities in New Hampshire contributed
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
to impaired driving so these changes are
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
needed and I would urge you to support
 
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
01:21:52.610 --> 01:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:53.940 align:start position:0%

01:21:56.510 --> 01:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
those statistic numbers you just gave I
 
01:21:58.250 --> 01:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
didn't have my pen ready fast enough no
 
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
problem ma'am uh 134 traffic fatalities
 
01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
in 2022 in New Hampshire that was of
 
01:22:08.050 --> 01:22:08.060 align:start position:0%
December 30th uh 2022 and then between
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
2009 and 2018 a 10-year period uh as
 
01:22:15.370 --> 01:22:15.380 align:start position:0%
provided by the CDC there was 354
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
fatalities in New Hampshire contributed
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
to impaired driving so this is important
 
01:22:24.490 --> 01:22:24.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:28.500 align:start position:0%

from the Supreme Court ruling was that
 
01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
from the minority opinion the dissenting
 
01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:44.580 align:start position:0%

Hampton Hampton Falls rye and stratum
 
01:31:31.010 --> 01:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to introduce Senate Bill
 
01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
244 relative to false public alarms in
 
01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
the beginning of this current school
 
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
year CNN published an article about the
 
01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
Fallout from active shooter hoaxes
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
beginning with a school in Arkansas and
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
multiple schools in Florida students
 
01:31:53.149 --> 01:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
teachers and parents all traumatized by
 
01:31:55.370 --> 01:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
this experience you have that article
 
01:31:58.209 --> 01:31:58.219 align:start position:0%
coming around to you
 
01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
then it was our turn in New Hampshire
 
01:32:06.050 --> 01:32:06.060 align:start position:0%
less than apprehended will terrorize our
 
01:32:08.510 --> 01:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
communities and exhaust our resources
 
01:32:15.290 --> 01:32:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.050 --> 01:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
in which instance can you point to where
 
01:32:20.330 --> 01:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
this has happened in New Hampshire from
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
an adult as an adult uh committed a
 
01:32:26.689 --> 01:32:26.699 align:start position:0%
false report on a high school or School
 
01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I thank you for
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
your your question representative
 
01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.870 align:start position:0%
your your question representative
wheeler

01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
wheeler
 
01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:33.649 align:start position:0%
wheeler
um

01:32:33.649 --> 01:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:36.890 --> 01:32:36.900 align:start position:0%
what I can point to is that there have
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
been 12
 
01:32:40.689 --> 01:32:40.699 align:start position:0%
false reports
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
of active shooters that have cleared out
 
01:32:45.770 --> 01:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
schools that have traumatized
 
01:32:47.810 --> 01:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
communities that have traumatized
 
01:32:50.689 --> 01:32:50.699 align:start position:0%
children who are in those schools and
 
01:32:53.410 --> 01:32:53.420 align:start position:0%
when those
 
01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
perpetrators are apprehended for these
 
01:32:58.669 --> 01:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
false reports they will suffer nothing
 
01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
more than a misdemeanor violation
 
01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
and it is the opinion of the New
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Senate that that is
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and that this kind of
 
01:33:15.649 --> 01:33:15.659 align:start position:0%
terrorizing deserves to be acknowledged
 
01:33:21.709 --> 01:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:26.209 --> 01:33:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:33:29.689 --> 01:33:29.699 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
um I actually have the same concern that
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler has and I looked
 
01:33:38.450 --> 01:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
at some of the notes from the Senate and
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
the question was
 
01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:42.050 align:start position:0%
the question was
um

01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:42.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:47.689 --> 01:33:47.699 align:start position:0%
bad eyesight and the answer was yes
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
but it's not likely to happen would you
 
01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
have a problem in some type of amendment
 
01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:55.139 align:start position:0%
that would um kind of
 
01:33:55.139 --> 01:33:55.910 align:start position:0%
that would um kind of
um

01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:59.570 --> 01:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
not allow that 15 16 17 year old to be
 
01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:01.470 align:start position:0%
charged with a felony
 
01:34:01.470 --> 01:34:02.689 align:start position:0%
charged with a felony
[Music]

01:34:02.689 --> 01:34:02.699 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:34:06.649 --> 01:34:06.659 align:start position:0%
So currently that is under the judicial
 
01:34:10.370 --> 01:34:10.380 align:start position:0%
discretion of our County attorneys and
 
01:34:15.290 --> 01:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
your your mic isn't on
 
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
um the the current statute as I read it
 
01:34:27.169 --> 01:34:27.179 align:start position:0%
already has uh at least one type of
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
incident that already is a class B
 
01:34:32.450 --> 01:34:32.460 align:start position:0%
felony if it's called in and that's uh
 
01:34:35.090 --> 01:34:35.100 align:start position:0%
if somebody calls in a false report of a
 
01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:37.310 align:start position:0%
if somebody calls in a false report of a
Biohazard

01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
Biohazard
 
01:34:41.209 --> 01:34:41.219 align:start position:0%
uh so there is precedent uh for doing
 
01:34:42.649 --> 01:34:42.659 align:start position:0%
something like this in our statute
 
01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
correct indeed there there is precedent
 
01:34:46.250 --> 01:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:34:48.169 --> 01:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
um so a biohazard
 
01:34:48.179 --> 01:34:48.850 align:start position:0%
um so a biohazard
um

01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:48.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:51.890 --> 01:34:51.900 align:start position:0%
and the Senate has also added in bomb
 
01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:53.149 align:start position:0%
and the Senate has also added in bomb
threats

01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
threats
 
01:34:57.649 --> 01:34:57.659 align:start position:0%
um so we have uh we have a more
 
01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
um we have a heavier penalty on calling
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
in a Biohazard
 
01:35:04.850 --> 01:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
than we do in calling in an active
 
01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:07.310 align:start position:0%
than we do in calling in an active
shooter

01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
shooter
 
01:35:09.530 --> 01:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
hoax so
 
01:35:13.129 --> 01:35:13.139 align:start position:0%
you know this this seeks to acknowledge
 
01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
the seriousness
 
01:35:16.129 --> 01:35:16.139 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:35:20.689 --> 01:35:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:24.370 --> 01:35:24.380 align:start position:0%
and part of the reason for separating
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
incidents like this from incidents for
 
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
for example just pulling a fire alarm at
 
01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
high school and I think we've all been
 
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
through been through that but one of the
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
reasons why you might treat this
 
01:35:40.669 --> 01:35:40.679 align:start position:0%
differently is because the level of of
 
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
police and resource response
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
um the level of uh fear and the type of
 
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
response especially after of all the it
 
01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
can generate in parents
 
01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
um calling in a threat of this nature
 
01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
would appear to
 
01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:57.830 align:start position:0%
would appear to
um

01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:00.169 align:start position:0%
um
just

01:36:00.169 --> 01:36:00.179 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
really kind of put this type of an
 
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
offense it really a totally different
 
01:36:06.290 --> 01:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
level than some of the other things
 
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
we're usually talking about is that how
 
01:36:10.129 --> 01:36:10.139 align:start position:0%
you see it
 
01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
um that's that's indeed how I see it we
 
01:36:16.970 --> 01:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
we have required our schools
 
01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:17.830 align:start position:0%
we have required our schools
um

01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
by the change in our culture
 
01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
to prepare
 
01:36:27.050 --> 01:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
for an active shooter and the
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
preparation includes drills and every
 
01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
time we do that we now know that our
 
01:36:36.110 --> 01:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
students are you know are traumatized
 
01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
because they know they know what
 
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
happened in Nashville they know what
 
01:36:45.290 --> 01:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
happened in Parkland they know they're
 
01:36:48.850 --> 01:36:48.860 align:start position:0%
not unaware they're not unaware at all
 
01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:53.159 align:start position:0%
little ones are not unaware older
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
students are not unaware and when a hoax
 
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
comes in and sends a community
 
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
into panic and parents rushed to the
 
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
schools and the state police rushed to
 
01:37:10.729 --> 01:37:10.739 align:start position:0%
provide Mutual Aid and like in the towns
 
01:37:12.970 --> 01:37:12.980 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned before
 
01:37:17.689 --> 01:37:17.699 align:start position:0%
ten towns all on one day responding to
 
01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
their schools 10 communities sent into
 
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
tailspins that's a serious serious
 
01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
thing to do and it it deserves a a
 
01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
serious response from our
 
01:37:35.930 --> 01:37:35.940 align:start position:0%
judicial system in my opinion and in the
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
Senate's opinion
 
01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
represent salic
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:37:42.239 --> 01:37:43.629 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

01:37:43.629 --> 01:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
my school system was also subject to one
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
of these um
 
01:37:53.930 --> 01:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
folks's Terrace hoaxes prior to the
 
01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
school day beginning because of our
 
01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:57.179 align:start position:0%
later start time so they were able to
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
clear it before students arrived
 
01:38:02.770 --> 01:38:02.780 align:start position:0%
thankfully but um
 
01:38:05.689 --> 01:38:05.699 align:start position:0%
one of the many impacts you talked about
 
01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
is the fiscal cost of bringing in all
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
these resources I'm wondering if you
 
01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:12.350 align:start position:0%
these resources I'm wondering if you
have

01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:15.050 align:start position:0%
have
um information

01:38:15.050 --> 01:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
um let me be clear I I support your
 
01:38:19.490 --> 01:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
promotion but I just I'm curious for
 
01:38:21.169 --> 01:38:21.179 align:start position:0%
people who might not be able to see past
 
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
the the certain elements but to the
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal cost of of what it is and if you
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
have a sense of how much that is in
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
terms of bringing in all of these
 
01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:30.290 align:start position:0%
terms of bringing in all of these
resources

01:38:30.290 --> 01:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
um to a school
 
01:38:34.729 --> 01:38:34.739 align:start position:0%
um well that would be that would be an
 
01:38:34.739 --> 01:38:36.350 align:start position:0%
um well that would be that would be an
interesting

01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
um collection of of bills
 
01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
um but if in the p in the M article that
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
you have which is uh referenced in my
 
01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:53.159 align:start position:0%
testimony as B and it is from
 
01:38:56.209 --> 01:38:56.219 align:start position:0%
Seacoast online and it references the
 
01:39:00.189 --> 01:39:00.199 align:start position:0%
the training that our school Community
 
01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
engaged in prior to school beginning so
 
01:39:05.689 --> 01:39:05.699 align:start position:0%
that they were prepared
 
01:39:05.699 --> 01:39:06.950 align:start position:0%
that they were prepared
um

01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:10.250 --> 01:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
you know anytime uh local municipality
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
has to send everybody out and call in
 
01:39:19.970 --> 01:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:21.950 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:39:23.450 --> 01:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:39:25.010 --> 01:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:39:27.169 --> 01:39:27.179 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate this very much as a
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
mother of a high schooler who
 
01:39:31.070 --> 01:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
um I believe times don't take it as
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
seriously as it should be and it
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely should be my question is when
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
there's something like that that Keane
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
experienced where it was a tick tock
 
01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:40.430 align:start position:0%
experienced where it was a tick tock
Trend

01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
Trend
 
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
um you know and I'm not I'm not saying
 
01:39:45.169 --> 01:39:45.179 align:start position:0%
I'm not condoning that whatsoever but my
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
question is if someone shared something
 
01:39:49.729 --> 01:39:49.739 align:start position:0%
on social media that was something like
 
01:39:51.410 --> 01:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
that would they still be accountable in
 
01:39:54.410 --> 01:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.930 --> 01:39:58.940 align:start position:0%
um so this bill specifically refers to
 
01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
hoaxes that are called into schools
 
01:40:05.450 --> 01:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
that then subsequently warrant response
 
01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:06.530 align:start position:0%
that then subsequently warrant response
and

01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
all practice policy and precedent right
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
now shows that
 
01:40:15.229 --> 01:40:15.239 align:start position:0%
response is as if it were real so
 
01:40:17.890 --> 01:40:17.900 align:start position:0%
um I can't speak to whether your
 
01:40:20.110 --> 01:40:20.120 align:start position:0%
municipality would
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
do an all-out response from a social
 
01:40:24.590 --> 01:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
media post or they might do an
 
01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
investigation into that social media
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
post but when a school
 
01:40:32.810 --> 01:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
receives a call saying there's a an
 
01:40:35.450 --> 01:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
active shooter in the building
 
01:40:39.050 --> 01:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
they have to they have to go into they
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
have to go into their predetermined
 
01:40:44.209 --> 01:40:44.219 align:start position:0%
response I I couldn't speak to this bill
 
01:40:45.770 --> 01:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
doesn't address if somebody saw
 
01:40:48.169 --> 01:40:48.179 align:start position:0%
something on any kind of social media
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
platform we're talking about actual
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
calls that come into the schools
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
follow up really quickly
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
um just really quickly so so essentially
 
01:40:58.850 --> 01:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
at that point what it seems to me like
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's dependent on the level of
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
response so in Keen for example they did
 
01:41:03.950 --> 01:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
find it uncredible they still went
 
01:41:05.570 --> 01:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
through the school day my son stayed
 
01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
home and I was fine with that because he
 
01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
was scared
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
um but but there was not there was an
 
01:41:13.310 --> 01:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
investigation but not uh an all hands on
 
01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
deck because they did not find it to be
 
01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
credible because it was Tick Tock so the
 
01:41:19.370 --> 01:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
the distinguished distinguishing factor
 
01:41:21.410 --> 01:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
of whether it would be prosecuted in
 
01:41:23.450 --> 01:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
this way or not is not whether it's a
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
phone call but it's the level of
 
01:41:28.189 --> 01:41:28.199 align:start position:0%
response am I clear on that or maybe not
 
01:41:33.649 --> 01:41:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I I'm gonna have to
 
01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
take a moment and and possibly refer
 
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
back to you in or refer back to the
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
committee in writing I need to
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
formulate a more articulate response but
 
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
um this bill is does not
 
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:51.910 align:start position:0%
um this bill is does not
um

01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:55.970 --> 01:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
does not address potential
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
threats that have not occurred
 
01:42:00.129 --> 01:42:00.139 align:start position:0%
from social media
 
01:42:04.850 --> 01:42:04.860 align:start position:0%
or potential threats from rumors this is
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
actual threats actual
 
01:42:10.850 --> 01:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
reports of an active shoot Act of an
 
01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
active shooter okay I think so yeah
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:42:23.810 --> 01:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
you referenced that a class B felony is
 
01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
three and a half to seven years
 
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.070 align:start position:0%
three and a half to seven years
um

01:42:28.070 --> 01:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:29.689 --> 01:42:29.699 align:start position:0%
if something like this were to happen
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
isn't it isn't it
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
the outcome may be the judge will
 
01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
determine whether it's first offense the
 
01:42:39.530 --> 01:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
the ability of the person thought they
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
were fully aware of that so the
 
01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
potential punishment could be much much
 
01:42:43.679 --> 01:42:44.930 align:start position:0%
potential punishment could be much much
less

01:42:44.930 --> 01:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:42:49.250 --> 01:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
could even be a misdemeanor or or lower
 
01:42:51.649 --> 01:42:51.659 align:start position:0%
is that correct thank you for the
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
question representative Newman
 
01:42:53.639 --> 01:42:54.290 align:start position:0%
question representative Newman
um

01:42:54.290 --> 01:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
as this bill is written it does leave
 
01:42:58.199 --> 01:43:00.649 align:start position:0%
as this bill is written it does leave
prosecutorial

01:43:00.649 --> 01:43:00.659 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:43:04.689 --> 01:43:04.699 align:start position:0%
um adjudication
 
01:43:07.370 --> 01:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
within its current
 
01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:11.780 align:start position:0%
leeway it offers the opportunity
 
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
for a judge should they want to or
 
01:43:16.689 --> 01:43:16.699 align:start position:0%
should it be
 
01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate to bring the potential
 
01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
incarceration of a maximum of seven
 
01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:25.629 align:start position:0%
incarceration of a maximum of seven
years

01:43:25.629 --> 01:43:25.639 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
because that is what we have determined
 
01:43:31.090 --> 01:43:31.100 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to be an appropriate
 
01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
response to a class B felony
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
this proposal is to bring this very
 
01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:43.860 align:start position:0%
traumatizing and terrorizing event into
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
the umbrella of Class B felonies but it
 
01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
is not we don't have mandatory
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
sentencing for class B felonies there's
 
01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
judicial discretion so indeed you are
 
01:43:55.980 --> 01:43:59.930 align:start position:0%
judicial discretion so indeed you are
correct

01:43:59.930 --> 01:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
follow-up I might not might not have
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
been clear in this state I believe
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
that for there to be a mandatory minimum
 
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
that mandatory minimum must be written
 
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
into the law which it affects that makes
 
01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
it there are mandatory minimums in this
 
01:44:19.129 --> 01:44:19.139 align:start position:0%
state I believe I'm
 
01:44:21.770 --> 01:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
if you want to say anything about that
 
01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
there's there's a range there's a range
 
01:44:26.090 --> 01:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
because we have
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
we have put a range into our
 
01:44:31.850 --> 01:44:31.860 align:start position:0%
um our penalty phases so Class B
 
01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
felonies this would be a class B felony
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
within that range
 
01:44:40.609 --> 01:44:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
um this bill addresses uh one type of a
 
01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
of a crime that's become more common
 
01:44:51.770 --> 01:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
called uh called swatting and when it
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
comes to the uh when it comes to the
 
01:44:56.810 --> 01:44:56.820 align:start position:0%
level of penalty my understanding is
 
01:44:59.050 --> 01:44:59.060 align:start position:0%
that other types of swatting incidents
 
01:45:01.970 --> 01:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
have resulted sometimes in people losing
 
01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
their lives or being severely injured is
 
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
that where you could see uh in a in in
 
01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:09.179 align:start position:0%
the law that we're talking about now the
 
01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
bill that we're talking about now is
 
01:45:14.209 --> 01:45:14.219 align:start position:0%
that a situation where you might see a
 
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
judge using some of that discretion when
 
01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
it comes to maybe going to the farther
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
end of the spectrum maybe to seven years
 
01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
or something like that
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
um well I think you for the question
 
01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
um but I I can't hypothesize what a
 
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
judge may or may not do with that but
 
01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:36.530 align:start position:0%
judge may or may not do with that but
your

01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
your assessment of the intensity of
 
01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
response of these kind of Collins of
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
active Shooters is correct when we had
 
01:45:49.850 --> 01:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
it and we thought it was real our team
 
01:45:51.709 --> 01:45:51.719 align:start position:0%
went down to do that thankfully it
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't but the parents racing down Main
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
Street in Concord that was real
 
01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
the woman who came and dropped her knees
 
01:46:04.850 --> 01:46:04.860 align:start position:0%
outside the fence that was real we told
 
01:46:06.410 --> 01:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
her we were standing there with police
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
officers and told her in that moment
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
that it was a fake call and I was so
 
01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
relieved to tell her but that what she
 
01:46:14.930 --> 01:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
experienced was real this is real trauma
 
01:46:16.729 --> 01:46:16.739 align:start position:0%
being under some people and people need
 
01:46:18.590 --> 01:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
to be held accountable for it and
 
01:46:20.209 --> 01:46:20.219 align:start position:0%
everyone knows what is happening in our
 
01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
country so it's not it's not a hoax it's
 
01:46:26.810 --> 01:46:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:28.129 --> 01:46:28.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:46.490 --> 01:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.290 --> 01:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
morning again
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
Madam chair members of the committee my
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
name is Joe habecki the chief police in
 
01:46:55.010 --> 01:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
Hollis in the media past president
 
01:46:57.649 --> 01:46:57.659 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Association a
 
01:47:00.109 --> 01:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
Chiefs the police I wasn't uh planning
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
on uh providing testimony but I'm happy
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
to do so uh the association supports
 
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:47:07.199 --> 01:47:08.510 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
I asked the question of you all why are
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
we not doing this
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
why would you not support this bill
 
01:47:18.590 --> 01:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
turn your television on open the
 
01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:19.790 align:start position:0%
turn your television on open the
newspaper

01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
newspaper
 
01:47:21.530 --> 01:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
look on the internet
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
this is becoming more frequent
 
01:47:27.649 --> 01:47:27.659 align:start position:0%
in its extremely alarming as apparent to
 
01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
an 11 year old and as a Public Service
 
01:47:32.270 --> 01:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
public safety professional
 
01:47:35.390 --> 01:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
some of the things I heard was
 
01:47:39.950 --> 01:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
the immense uh taxing of resources to
 
01:47:42.169 --> 01:47:42.179 align:start position:0%
respond to these incidents
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
that is true it's very true
 
01:47:47.450 --> 01:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
as a chief my job is to mitigate risk
 
01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
it's one of the most important things I
 
01:47:54.050 --> 01:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
do when you have a large-scale response
 
01:47:56.450 --> 01:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
I work for a small town so we rely
 
01:47:59.209 --> 01:47:59.219 align:start position:0%
heavily on Mutual Aid when you have a
 
01:48:01.729 --> 01:48:01.739 align:start position:0%
large-scale response
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
um it elevates risk it elevates risk to
 
01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:05.510 align:start position:0%
um it elevates risk it elevates risk to
everyone

01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
01:48:07.810 --> 01:48:07.820 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm making overtime
 
01:48:10.490 --> 01:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
that's time and a half of an officer's
 
01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
hourly wage and it can become quite
 
01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:15.250 align:start position:0%
hourly wage and it can become quite
costly

01:48:15.250 --> 01:48:15.260 align:start position:0%
costly
 
01:48:18.050 --> 01:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
additionally it creates a heightened
 
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
level of fear
 
01:48:22.250 --> 01:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
are we just to
 
01:48:24.709 --> 01:48:24.719 align:start position:0%
allow this to continue without holding
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
folks accountable
 
01:48:30.010 --> 01:48:30.020 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's a good option
 
01:48:32.689 --> 01:48:32.699 align:start position:0%
there needs to be accountability for
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
people who do this
 
01:48:39.050 --> 01:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
particularly as a way to capitalize
 
01:48:43.010 --> 01:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
on the horrific gross acts of violence
 
01:48:45.470 --> 01:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
that we see in our schools and in other
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
places of gathering whether they be
 
01:48:49.609 --> 01:48:49.619 align:start position:0%
places of worship
 
01:48:51.229 --> 01:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
shopping malls
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
supermarkets Etc
 
01:48:56.570 --> 01:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions you or
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
try and answer any questions you have
 
01:49:01.850 --> 01:49:01.860 align:start position:0%
thank you chief chief are you aware of
 
01:49:03.770 --> 01:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
any arrests made for this crime in this
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
state in the last year
 
01:49:08.090 --> 01:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
for what you folks have referred to as
 
01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
swatting type calls uh I'm not Mr chair
 
01:49:13.609 --> 01:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
I can certainly look into that and
 
01:49:15.770 --> 01:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
report back to the committee yeah I'm
 
01:49:18.050 --> 01:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
interested in knowing um
 
01:49:20.810 --> 01:49:20.820 align:start position:0%
have we have we have do we have cases
 
01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
where we wished we could have charged a
 
01:49:25.250 --> 01:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
felony but couldn't because the law sure
 
01:49:27.890 --> 01:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
yeah I know these becoming they're
 
01:49:30.050 --> 01:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
oftentimes very complex to investigate
 
01:49:32.450 --> 01:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
because folks will use you know spoofing
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
apps and things like that this is such a
 
01:49:37.010 --> 01:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
problem I'll put it in this context that
 
01:49:40.850 --> 01:49:40.860 align:start position:0%
the FBI actually has a specific training
 
01:49:43.970 --> 01:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
um for Public Safety agencies not just
 
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
police but also fire
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
um EMS because oftentimes those folks
 
01:49:51.530 --> 01:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
are taxed to respond to these types of
 
01:49:54.169 --> 01:49:54.179 align:start position:0%
calls they had actually organize a
 
01:49:54.179 --> 01:49:55.790 align:start position:0%
calls they had actually organize a
training

01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:49:59.149 --> 01:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
for municipalities so they could be more
 
01:50:00.649 --> 01:50:00.659 align:start position:0%
uniform and standardized in their
 
01:50:02.570 --> 01:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
approach to these types of calls so it's
 
01:50:04.189 --> 01:50:04.199 align:start position:0%
getting out of hand
 
01:50:06.770 --> 01:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
that that raises another question if I
 
01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:07.550 align:start position:0%
that that raises another question if I
may

01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
um are you aware if there's a federal uh
 
01:50:11.930 --> 01:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
crime for this because it is used in
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
telephonic so it would fall under the
 
01:50:16.129 --> 01:50:16.139 align:start position:0%
federal law if if they still choose and
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there probably are federal
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
statutes that do apply to this
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
um I will say you know I find it kind of
 
01:50:25.129 --> 01:50:25.139 align:start position:0%
a lot that we have in statute 6443 we
 
01:50:27.050 --> 01:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
have language relative to
 
01:50:28.850 --> 01:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
chemical spills
 
01:50:32.209 --> 01:50:32.219 align:start position:0%
we have felony level offenses for folks
 
01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
that tamper with fire alarms
 
01:50:37.070 --> 01:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
but we're arguing over the merits of
 
01:50:39.590 --> 01:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
making a you know felony level offense
 
01:50:43.250 --> 01:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
for folks that call in an active shooter
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
just makes no sense to me I would I
 
01:50:47.090 --> 01:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
would say that we're not arguing I think
 
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
that we're just trying to make sure
 
01:50:52.010 --> 01:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
I'm passionate about this issue so I
 
01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:53.149 align:start position:0%
I'm passionate about this issue so I
understand

01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:50:55.250 --> 01:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
um representative janburn
 
01:50:57.649 --> 01:50:57.659 align:start position:0%
Jacob thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:50:59.209 --> 01:50:59.219 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question thank you sir
 
01:50:59.219 --> 01:51:00.709 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question thank you sir
so

01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:03.649 --> 01:51:03.659 align:start position:0%
I'm looking to
 
01:51:06.649 --> 01:51:06.659 align:start position:0%
when fishing game gets a call
 
01:51:08.570 --> 01:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
that somebody's lost in the woods and
 
01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
they have to respond and they respond
 
01:51:12.649 --> 01:51:12.659 align:start position:0%
with many people to go and do a search
 
01:51:12.659 --> 01:51:13.550 align:start position:0%
with many people to go and do a search
party

01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
party
 
01:51:15.649 --> 01:51:15.659 align:start position:0%
and that person didn't have the hike
 
01:51:17.330 --> 01:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
safe card or didn't have a hunting or
 
01:51:19.729 --> 01:51:19.739 align:start position:0%
fishing license they're usually charged
 
01:51:22.010 --> 01:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
to reimburse the department for that
 
01:51:24.290 --> 01:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
service sure
 
01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:26.030 align:start position:0%
service sure
um

01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:28.370 --> 01:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
with this type of crime
 
01:51:28.380 --> 01:51:29.030 align:start position:0%
with this type of crime
um

01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:31.070 --> 01:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
do you think that it would be
 
01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:32.750 align:start position:0%
do you think that it would be
appropriate

01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
in addition to the felony to also charge
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
that person for the responding agency's
 
01:51:38.159 --> 01:51:41.570 align:start position:0%
that person for the responding agency's
expenses

01:51:41.570 --> 01:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:43.550 --> 01:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's a valid question I'm not sure I can
 
01:51:45.070 --> 01:51:45.080 align:start position:0%
give you a good answer I know the courts
 
01:51:47.930 --> 01:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
the courts would probably have issue
 
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
with it I mean we've
 
01:51:51.649 --> 01:51:51.659 align:start position:0%
in various instances where people have
 
01:51:53.990 --> 01:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
committed violations or crimes I can
 
01:51:56.209 --> 01:51:56.219 align:start position:0%
think of when I was a member of the SWAT
 
01:51:58.970 --> 01:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
team where we've tried to to Bill folks
 
01:52:01.850 --> 01:52:01.860 align:start position:0%
for over time
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
um for the folks that were responding to
 
01:52:06.890 --> 01:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
the call and the courts can go either
 
01:52:09.290 --> 01:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
way judges are typically very cautious
 
01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:10.870 align:start position:0%
way judges are typically very cautious
to

01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:52:13.490 --> 01:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
mandate restitution like that for
 
01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
certain cases so I guess my answer to
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
you is I don't know how to answer it's a
 
01:52:20.209 --> 01:52:20.219 align:start position:0%
difficult question to answer
 
01:52:22.430 --> 01:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
in theory I think it's a good idea but I
 
01:52:24.350 --> 01:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know how the courts would
 
01:52:28.129 --> 01:52:28.139 align:start position:0%
perceive that and and see that
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:32.990 --> 01:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question I was looking forward
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
um is it not true that sometimes these
 
01:52:40.609 --> 01:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
calls can be made by potential Shooters
 
01:52:42.530 --> 01:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
to almost see like what the response is
 
01:52:44.810 --> 01:52:44.820 align:start position:0%
like and so they can make plans for
 
01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:45.590 align:start position:0%
like and so they can make plans for
their

01:52:45.590 --> 01:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:52:48.770 --> 01:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
um you know crime in the future so if we
 
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
passed a bill like this it potentially
 
01:52:52.490 --> 01:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
could stop a shooting before it even
 
01:52:54.169 --> 01:52:54.179 align:start position:0%
happened as the person would be arrested
 
01:52:56.510 --> 01:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
and charged with a felony before they
 
01:52:57.890 --> 01:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
even had the chance to carry something
 
01:53:00.250 --> 01:53:00.260 align:start position:0%
like that out
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
valid argument valid point and that's
 
01:53:04.490 --> 01:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
true oftentimes
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
you know folks will test response
 
01:53:10.189 --> 01:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
um and that's not a new phenomenon that
 
01:53:12.169 --> 01:53:12.179 align:start position:0%
done that with things such as Bank alarm
 
01:53:15.109 --> 01:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
response and such for many many years so
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's a valid point and I would agree
 
01:53:20.450 --> 01:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
with your questions slash statement
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
Representatives say like
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:24.950 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
um I've been doing some work recently
 
01:53:30.050 --> 01:53:30.060 align:start position:0%
related to PTSD and First Responders and
 
01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:31.430 align:start position:0%
related to PTSD and First Responders and
um

01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:33.770 --> 01:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
um in addition to all of the PTSD that
 
01:53:35.209 --> 01:53:35.219 align:start position:0%
this would cause teachers and students
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
and parents
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious if you could speak to how
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
responding to these calls might trigger
 
01:53:46.430 --> 01:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
PTSD in First Responders and
 
01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:47.810 align:start position:0%
PTSD in First Responders and
for

01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
people who might be more focused purely
 
01:53:52.250 --> 01:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
on fiscal aspects rather than on
 
01:53:55.010 --> 01:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
practical and safety ones what the
 
01:53:57.169 --> 01:53:57.179 align:start position:0%
financial impact of having
 
01:54:00.410 --> 01:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
that occur might be
 
01:54:03.050 --> 01:54:03.060 align:start position:0%
so in my opinion these could be you know
 
01:54:04.669 --> 01:54:04.679 align:start position:0%
what they refer to as triggering events
 
01:54:06.890 --> 01:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
for folks that maybe have existing pts
 
01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:08.090 align:start position:0%
for folks that maybe have existing pts
conditions

01:54:08.090 --> 01:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
certainly it elevates
 
01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:10.910 align:start position:0%
certainly it elevates
um

01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
you know an officer is hyper vigilance
 
01:54:14.330 --> 01:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
when you're responding to these calls
 
01:54:16.669 --> 01:54:16.679 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're legitimate or not
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know if any of you have had the
 
01:54:21.229 --> 01:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to watch the video from
 
01:54:22.970 --> 01:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
from Nashville
 
01:54:26.570 --> 01:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
if you haven't please do listen to the
 
01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
officer's breath
 
01:54:31.609 --> 01:54:31.619 align:start position:0%
that will indicate to you the stress
 
01:54:34.129 --> 01:54:34.139 align:start position:0%
placed on the human body when you
 
01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
respond to these critical incidents
 
01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
whether they're legitimate or not
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
so I am very concerned about the
 
01:54:45.229 --> 01:54:45.239 align:start position:0%
increases as it relates to pts and
 
01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
having it be a triggering event
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
as you said there are costs not just
 
01:54:54.530 --> 01:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
in terms of resources per se but the
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
burden placed on
 
01:54:59.090 --> 01:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
people there's liability issues work
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
workers compensation
 
01:55:04.189 --> 01:55:04.199 align:start position:0%
it's hard to quantify
 
01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount fiscally that
 
01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:08.390 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount fiscally that
uh

01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
with the impact as it relates to these
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
types of calls and these types of ins
 
01:55:13.199 --> 01:55:17.930 align:start position:0%
types of calls and these types of ins
instances

01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:20.450 --> 01:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
I'm curious if the Chiefs Association
 
01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:24.060 align:start position:0%
has seen officers who are leaving the
 
01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's I'm sure there's some I
 
01:55:34.129 --> 01:55:34.139 align:start position:0%
mean these are tough times for law
 
01:55:36.290 --> 01:55:36.300 align:start position:0%
enforcement and
 
01:55:39.169 --> 01:55:39.179 align:start position:0%
um I think we're losing a lot of folks
 
01:55:39.179 --> 01:55:39.770 align:start position:0%
um I think we're losing a lot of folks
um

01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:42.530 --> 01:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
I saw a recent statistic where I think
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
Statewide we're down roughly 300
 
01:55:47.689 --> 01:55:47.699 align:start position:0%
officers or more
 
01:55:49.850 --> 01:55:49.860 align:start position:0%
um from what was
 
01:55:53.689 --> 01:55:53.699 align:start position:0%
a more robust uh I guess population of
 
01:55:55.550 --> 01:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
officers in the state you know 10 years
 
01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:56.510 align:start position:0%
officers in the state you know 10 years
ago

01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:55:58.370 --> 01:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
there's a number of police officers
 
01:56:00.169 --> 01:56:00.179 align:start position:0%
leaving in the profession whether it be
 
01:56:02.990 --> 01:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
by way or retirement or just simply
 
01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.129 align:start position:0%
by way or retirement or just simply
resigning

01:56:04.129 --> 01:56:04.139 align:start position:0%
resigning
 
01:56:05.450 --> 01:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
01:56:07.250 --> 01:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
heightened stress
 
01:56:09.890 --> 01:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
and the threat to safety is one of many
 
01:56:12.590 --> 01:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
factors leading to that
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:15.530 --> 01:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you chief for your testimony thank
 
01:56:17.930 --> 01:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
01:56:20.149 --> 01:56:20.159 align:start position:0%
at this point no one else willing to
 
01:56:22.609 --> 01:56:22.619 align:start position:0%
testify wants to testify
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
going once going twice closed
 
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
at this point I am going to open the
 
01:56:34.370 --> 01:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
public hearing on Senate Bill 245
 
01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes
 
01:57:01.310 --> 01:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:02.930 --> 01:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Roy and members of
 
01:57:04.250 --> 01:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
the committee hello again
 
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
my name is Daley frenette and I am the
 
01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
Senate majority caucus director I'm here
 
01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
today to introduce Senate Bill 245 on
 
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
behalf of senator rashardi
 
01:57:13.609 --> 01:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
Senator shorty was asked to sponsor this
 
01:57:15.410 --> 01:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
legislation by the New Hampshire lodging
 
01:57:17.629 --> 01:57:17.639 align:start position:0%
and Restaurant Association
 
01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
the bill is really a housekeeping Bill
 
01:57:21.229 --> 01:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
to update the law to better reflect the
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
reality of the industry with modern
 
01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:23.870 align:start position:0%
reality of the industry with modern
technology

01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:57:27.169 --> 01:57:27.179 align:start position:0%
RSA 353 colon 3 requires a lodging
 
01:57:29.330 --> 01:57:29.340 align:start position:0%
establishment to keep a record of the
 
01:57:30.770 --> 01:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
guests that have booked rooms and to
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
make that record available to public
 
01:57:34.970 --> 01:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
safety personnel if necessary
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
the statute was enacted in 1927 well
 
01:57:40.370 --> 01:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
before the Advent of computers now that
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
this information can be kept
 
01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
electronically it's about time that we
 
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
update the law
 
01:57:47.390 --> 01:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
there really is no need for a hotel to
 
01:57:49.250 --> 01:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
keep a book or card system to have the
 
01:57:50.810 --> 01:57:50.820 align:start position:0%
guest sign in
 
01:57:53.629 --> 01:57:53.639 align:start position:0%
SB 245 removes the Antiquated reference
 
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
to book or card system and simply
 
01:57:57.770 --> 01:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
requires the hotel to keep a record of
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
the guests
 
01:58:01.609 --> 01:58:01.619 align:start position:0%
Senator rashardi has drafted Amendment
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
language which was sent to the committee
 
01:58:05.450 --> 01:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
a few days ago Sarah shorty hopes that a
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
member of this committee will be willing
 
01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
to have this language drafted in their
 
01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
name so that the committee can consider
 
01:58:11.689 --> 01:58:11.699 align:start position:0%
it as a committee Amendment the
 
01:58:13.070 --> 01:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
amendment language addresses an issue
 
01:58:14.450 --> 01:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
that arose in the Senate Judiciary
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
Committee at the last minute the
 
01:58:18.169 --> 01:58:18.179 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment amended the bill to
 
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
keep the language in the law about the
 
01:58:21.649 --> 01:58:21.659 align:start position:0%
guests providing their legal name or the
 
01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
name by which the guest is commonly
 
01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:24.470 align:start position:0%
name by which the guest is commonly
known

01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
known
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
when it did so it reinserted the word
 
01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:27.830 align:start position:0%
when it did so it reinserted the word
sign

01:58:27.830 --> 01:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
sign
 
01:58:29.810 --> 01:58:29.820 align:start position:0%
with remotes with remote check-in and
 
01:58:31.850 --> 01:58:31.860 align:start position:0%
checkout there is sometimes no need for
 
01:58:33.770 --> 01:58:33.780 align:start position:0%
the guest to sign in this amendment
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
language removes the requirement to sign
 
01:58:37.129 --> 01:58:37.139 align:start position:0%
in and simply requires the hotel to keep
 
01:58:39.410 --> 01:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
a record of the guest's legal name or by
 
01:58:41.570 --> 01:58:41.580 align:start position:0%
which the guest is commonly known
 
01:58:42.770 --> 01:58:42.780 align:start position:0%

01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:44.460 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
Association

Association
 
01:59:29.149 --> 01:59:29.159 align:start position:0%
and I have to say I think this is the
 
01:59:30.770 --> 01:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
first time that I've testified before
 
01:59:32.689 --> 01:59:32.699 align:start position:0%
this committee uh with the logic and
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
Restaurant Association I live up in the
 
01:59:36.830 --> 01:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee or in the labor
 
01:59:38.570 --> 01:59:38.580 align:start position:0%
committee so I don't think I've ever
 
01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
been here for the lodging Restaurant
 
01:59:43.010 --> 01:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
Association but uh it's a pleasure to be
 
01:59:43.020 --> 01:59:44.209 align:start position:0%
Association but uh it's a pleasure to be
here

01:59:44.209 --> 01:59:44.219 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:59:44.219 --> 01:59:44.810 align:start position:0%
here
um

01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
as was just explained this is really a
 
01:59:50.450 --> 01:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill
 
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
um it's not intended to change any
 
01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:53.830 align:start position:0%
um it's not intended to change any
policy

01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:59:56.530 --> 01:59:56.540 align:start position:0%
the statute right now
 
02:00:02.470 --> 02:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
RSA 353 colon 3 requires the hotel
 
02:00:04.970 --> 02:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
basically to keep a record of the guests
 
02:00:10.010 --> 02:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
and if Public Safety uh suspect there's
 
02:00:14.089 --> 02:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
a suspect there that they could come and
 
02:00:16.370 --> 02:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
check the record of the guests and
 
02:00:18.530 --> 02:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
confirm whether or not the individual is
 
02:00:18.540 --> 02:00:19.330 align:start position:0%
confirm whether or not the individual is
there

02:00:19.330 --> 02:00:19.340 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:00:21.890 --> 02:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
we don't intend to change any of that
 
02:00:25.129 --> 02:00:25.139 align:start position:0%
what we simply want to do is update the
 
02:00:26.750 --> 02:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
language in the statute as it was
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned it was an act of 1927 that
 
02:00:32.990 --> 02:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
speaks to the hotel keeping a card
 
02:00:36.050 --> 02:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
system and a book for the guests to sign
 
02:00:39.649 --> 02:00:39.659 align:start position:0%
in I mean that's so Antiquated the
 
02:00:41.629 --> 02:00:41.639 align:start position:0%
industry now as you know it's all online
 
02:00:44.750 --> 02:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
you can check in remotely
 
02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:45.950 align:start position:0%
you can check in remotely
sell

02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
sell
 
02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
we've crafted the language so that it
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
basically says look you just got to keep
 
02:00:54.290 --> 02:00:54.300 align:start position:0%
a record of the guest and keep it open
 
02:00:57.169 --> 02:00:57.179 align:start position:0%
to inspection by Public Safety when the
 
02:00:58.609 --> 02:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
Senate was getting it out of the
 
02:01:00.290 --> 02:01:00.300 align:start position:0%
committee they had the hearing the
 
02:01:01.750 --> 02:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
hearing was done
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
we left the room they finished a few
 
02:01:07.370 --> 02:01:07.380 align:start position:0%
more hearings and at the end of their
 
02:01:09.890 --> 02:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
hearings they said we can get this bill
 
02:01:12.530 --> 02:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
out really quickly one of the Senators
 
02:01:15.709 --> 02:01:15.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to reinsert the language that is
 
02:01:18.290 --> 02:01:18.300 align:start position:0%
in the current statute that says you
 
02:01:21.770 --> 02:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
keep their legal name or the name by
 
02:01:25.129 --> 02:01:25.139 align:start position:0%
which they are commonly known by they
 
02:01:28.490 --> 02:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to put that back into the bill
 
02:01:31.310 --> 02:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
and they did but they also put the words
 
02:01:33.410 --> 02:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
that are in the statute that say they
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
signed their legal name which we want to
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
get away from that that was the whole
 
02:01:41.149 --> 02:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill so the amendment that
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
was presented that hopefully you have
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
before you takes the reference to
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
signing out and it basically just leaves
 
02:01:52.970 --> 02:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
it as we wanted to which is just keep
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
the record of the guest and keep it open
 
02:01:57.589 --> 02:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
to inspection that's it it's a simple
 
02:01:57.599 --> 02:01:58.970 align:start position:0%
to inspection that's it it's a simple
build

02:01:58.970 --> 02:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
build
 
02:02:00.649 --> 02:02:00.659 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:04.189 --> 02:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
um just one question how when it's all
 
02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
computerized if an officer comes in and
 
02:02:08.089 --> 02:02:08.099 align:start position:0%
says I'd like to see the list for today
 
02:02:10.729 --> 02:02:10.739 align:start position:0%
how how would the hotel go about showing
 
02:02:11.930 --> 02:02:11.940 align:start position:0%
them that like in the book they could
 
02:02:14.570 --> 02:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
just flip to today's page right
 
02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:16.910 align:start position:0%
just flip to today's page right
um

02:02:16.910 --> 02:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:19.370 --> 02:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
let me can I have Mike Summers he's the
 
02:02:23.149 --> 02:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh CEO of the uh organization
 
02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh sorry uh so my name is Mike Summers
 
02:02:26.629 --> 02:02:26.639 align:start position:0%
I'm the president CEO of New Hampshire
 
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
lodging and Restaurant Association so
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
the way the industry works these days is
 
02:02:32.570 --> 02:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
everything is digitized so if a law
 
02:02:33.770 --> 02:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer were to come to the
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
hotel and want to see the records they
 
02:02:37.729 --> 02:02:37.739 align:start position:0%
would just take them into the office or
 
02:02:39.169 --> 02:02:39.179 align:start position:0%
behind the front desk and they would
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
give them the computer screen and just
 
02:02:42.169 --> 02:02:42.179 align:start position:0%
show them okay who do you want to who
 
02:02:44.689 --> 02:02:44.699 align:start position:0%
are we looking for so it would all be
 
02:02:46.970 --> 02:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
ultimately be digitized
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
so if they for example wanted to see
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
today's everyone who checked in today
 
02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to just call that up on
 
02:02:54.070 --> 02:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely yes
 
02:02:56.209 --> 02:02:56.219 align:start position:0%
a lot of these hotels they can do it
 
02:02:58.010 --> 02:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
remotely from you know their corporate
 
02:02:59.209 --> 02:02:59.219 align:start position:0%
headquarters they can see how many
 
02:03:00.830 --> 02:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
guests checked in who the guests are Etc
 
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
so all that information is available it
 
02:03:04.129 --> 02:03:04.139 align:start position:0%
would just be a case of them going
 
02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
behind the desk and giving a monitor to
 
02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
look at and they could go through the
 
02:03:11.089 --> 02:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
records thank you
 
02:03:13.609 --> 02:03:13.619 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
02:03:15.050 --> 02:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:03:16.729 --> 02:03:16.739 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just have a
 
02:03:18.589 --> 02:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
question about
 
02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
um the um listing of the guest names I'm
 
02:03:23.689 --> 02:03:23.699 align:start position:0%
assuming that's the guest who booked the
 
02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
room but not anybody who might be
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
staying with them like if I booked it my
 
02:03:30.169 --> 02:03:30.179 align:start position:0%
own name my husband could be a guest so
 
02:03:32.810 --> 02:03:32.820 align:start position:0%
you don't really have a full description
 
02:03:34.729 --> 02:03:34.739 align:start position:0%
of who's in every room just the person
 
02:03:36.530 --> 02:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
that booked it correct and that's been
 
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
the historical standard yes okay thank
 
02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:42.290 align:start position:0%
the historical standard yes okay thank
you

02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:45.410 --> 02:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
02:03:47.570 --> 02:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
if this is to be used by law enforcement
 
02:03:50.330 --> 02:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
I think I might suggest words like this
 
02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
and I'd ask what you might think uh such
 
02:03:57.890 --> 02:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
a record uh shut um
 
02:04:01.490 --> 02:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
the legal name of each uh guest
 
02:04:04.669 --> 02:04:04.679 align:start position:0%
and the name by which the guest is
 
02:04:07.729 --> 02:04:07.739 align:start position:0%
commonly known if different
 
02:04:10.729 --> 02:04:10.739 align:start position:0%
or no and
 
02:04:10.739 --> 02:04:12.290 align:start position:0%
or no and
and

02:04:12.290 --> 02:04:12.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
that the name that's commonly used if it
 
02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
is different than the legal name because
 
02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
you know I could come in and say I'm
 
02:04:22.189 --> 02:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
sure and I don't tell you what I well
 
02:04:24.050 --> 02:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
and then frankly I think that uh that's
 
02:04:26.330 --> 02:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
a a technicality that the committee
 
02:04:28.550 --> 02:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
could certainly address I think the
 
02:04:31.129 --> 02:04:31.139 align:start position:0%
intent for us is to update
 
02:04:33.109 --> 02:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
what the statute because technically
 
02:04:35.149 --> 02:04:35.159 align:start position:0%
most hotels today are in violation of
 
02:04:36.890 --> 02:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
the current statute because currently
 
02:04:38.209 --> 02:04:38.219 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to keep a book and card
 
02:04:40.129 --> 02:04:40.139 align:start position:0%
system nobody does it's just
 
02:04:41.689 --> 02:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
exorbitantly expensive and time
 
02:04:43.970 --> 02:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
consuming and there are also many of
 
02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
them are not requiring anybody to sign
 
02:04:46.970 --> 02:04:46.980 align:start position:0%
anything when they check in they're just
 
02:04:49.310 --> 02:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
checking an ID so ultimately the
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
language that you feel more comfortable
 
02:04:53.390 --> 02:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
with I think we're fine with just so
 
02:04:55.070 --> 02:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
long as we're maintaining those two
 
02:04:56.870 --> 02:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
changes because that just updates to
 
02:04:58.550 --> 02:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
what the industry practice is today if
 
02:05:00.050 --> 02:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
that makes sense
 
02:05:02.089 --> 02:05:02.099 align:start position:0%
but I think to your point that may be
 
02:05:03.770 --> 02:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
more grammatically correct as you
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
describe it
 
02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:06.950 align:start position:0%
describe it
or

02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:05:09.470 --> 02:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
either their legal name or the name by
 
02:05:11.570 --> 02:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
which they're common
 
02:05:13.370 --> 02:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you both for your
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
testimony uh sir if you could fill out a
 
02:05:16.669 --> 02:05:16.679 align:start position:0%
pink card just so we have you for the
 
02:05:16.679 --> 02:05:19.010 align:start position:0%
pink card just so we have you for the
records

02:05:19.010 --> 02:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
records
 
02:05:21.709 --> 02:05:21.719 align:start position:0%
at this point the chair recognizes Roy
 
02:05:21.719 --> 02:05:29.050 align:start position:0%
at this point the chair recognizes Roy
schweiker

02:05:29.050 --> 02:05:29.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
02:05:33.410 --> 02:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Roy schweiger from Concord
 
02:05:33.420 --> 02:05:34.970 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Roy schweiger from Concord
and

02:05:34.970 --> 02:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:37.139 align:start position:0%
I agree with the fact that this thing
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
about the card system is Obsolete and
 
02:05:41.629 --> 02:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
needs to be changed
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
but I feel that this whole thing is
 
02:05:46.970 --> 02:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
Obsolete and needs more changes instead
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
of catering to the wishes of one senator
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
I mean I understand you know the old
 
02:05:53.209 --> 02:05:53.219 align:start position:0%
days the sheriff would wander into the
 
02:05:54.770 --> 02:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
thing and see who the strangers in town
 
02:05:56.750 --> 02:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
are and look at the list of guests
 
02:05:56.760 --> 02:05:58.070 align:start position:0%
are and look at the list of guests
and

02:05:58.070 --> 02:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:59.649 --> 02:05:59.659 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's appropriate anymore
 
02:06:02.750 --> 02:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
my recollection is there was a certain
 
02:06:06.530 --> 02:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
bill that the same committee acted on
 
02:06:08.629 --> 02:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
which had to do with unjust criminal
 
02:06:13.370 --> 02:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
prosecution HB 89 where some
 
02:06:15.950 --> 02:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
operator of a camp refused even with a
 
02:06:18.109 --> 02:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
warrant to give the names of the guests
 
02:06:21.229 --> 02:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
there and he was convicted and this
 
02:06:22.910 --> 02:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
Committee just essentially vacated that
 
02:06:24.050 --> 02:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
conviction this was an unjust
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
prosecution he was entitled to not give
 
02:06:27.890 --> 02:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
out the names of the people that
 
02:06:29.209 --> 02:06:29.219 align:start position:0%
attended his camp
 
02:06:31.669 --> 02:06:31.679 align:start position:0%
and I think the same thing could be true
 
02:06:34.430 --> 02:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
with Hotel records why does the police
 
02:06:35.570 --> 02:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
have a
 
02:06:38.209 --> 02:06:38.219 align:start position:0%
ability to just wander in and ask who's
 
02:06:40.129 --> 02:06:40.139 align:start position:0%
staying at the hotel I would say it
 
02:06:42.109 --> 02:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
might be more correct to do what hotels
 
02:06:44.750 --> 02:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
do now if you call up and say is John
 
02:06:47.149 --> 02:06:47.159 align:start position:0%
Smith staying at the hotel they will
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
admit if he is and they'll connect you
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
to his room but they won't tell you
 
02:06:52.370 --> 02:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
where his room is it's up to John Smith
 
02:06:55.810 --> 02:06:55.820 align:start position:0%
to decide if he wants to uh
 
02:06:58.070 --> 02:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
admit this person that wants to talk to
 
02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
him so I think we need to delete that
 
02:07:03.169 --> 02:07:03.179 align:start position:0%
whole sentence regarding the showing the
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
thing to the police because I don't
 
02:07:06.350 --> 02:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
think it's appropriate if they need to
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
know the list of everybody in the hotel
 
02:07:10.669 --> 02:07:10.679 align:start position:0%
let him go get a warrant and even then
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
apparently this committee feels that
 
02:07:14.270 --> 02:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
even with a warrant it may not be
 
02:07:16.010 --> 02:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
desirable for the hotel to give out the
 
02:07:19.010 --> 02:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
list of people so I would say that whole
 
02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
business about showing the register to
 
02:07:23.089 --> 02:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
the police officers needs to be removed
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
and the second thing that essentially is
 
02:07:28.189 --> 02:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
taken care of maybe with this amendment
 
02:07:30.649 --> 02:07:30.659 align:start position:0%
about signing the register that once
 
02:07:33.050 --> 02:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
again the current bill or the current
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
statute says that every member who's
 
02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
staying there needs to sign it once
 
02:07:39.709 --> 02:07:39.719 align:start position:0%
again I would say this is something that
 
02:07:41.570 --> 02:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
is not enforced either not just
 
02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
assigning it but like someone said if
 
02:07:46.850 --> 02:07:46.860 align:start position:0%
one person reserves the room you know
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
you may not know who else is staying
 
02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:49.490 align:start position:0%
you may not know who else is staying
there

02:07:49.490 --> 02:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:07:53.390 --> 02:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
and this bill if it is implemented even
 
02:07:55.250 --> 02:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
minor children would have to you know
 
02:07:57.109 --> 02:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
show up and have the name listed even if
 
02:07:58.550 --> 02:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
they don't have to physically sign
 
02:08:00.530 --> 02:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
something I think that you know once
 
02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:01.310 align:start position:0%
something I think that you know once
again

02:08:01.310 --> 02:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:08:03.890 --> 02:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
maybe you want the hotel owner to know
 
02:08:06.350 --> 02:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
the name of every person including kids
 
02:08:09.169 --> 02:08:09.179 align:start position:0%
and whatever who's staying there but I'm
 
02:08:10.609 --> 02:08:10.619 align:start position:0%
not sure that that's true or something
 
02:08:13.129 --> 02:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
they probably aren't doing today so this
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
is in effect if you pass it as written
 
02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:16.970 align:start position:0%
is in effect if you pass it as written
your

02:08:16.970 --> 02:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:08:19.070 --> 02:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
should we say saying that the current
 
02:08:20.570 --> 02:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
statute is correct and they should be
 
02:08:23.330 --> 02:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
keeping those detailed records and since
 
02:08:25.250 --> 02:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
presumably they'll now be expected to
 
02:08:27.410 --> 02:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
follow it now to remove the cards then
 
02:08:28.729 --> 02:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
they'll be expected to follow it in
 
02:08:30.350 --> 02:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
terms of the names of everyone who's
 
02:08:33.649 --> 02:08:33.659 align:start position:0%
there and you know I'm not sure that's
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate you know maybe it is but
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
certainly I think this business of any
 
02:08:40.430 --> 02:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
police officer walking in and saying I
 
02:08:41.570 --> 02:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
want to know everyone was staying here
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's you know kind of not in keeping
 
02:08:45.709 --> 02:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
with what we do elsewhere
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
I mean once again you read about the
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
airbnbs they have random people staying
 
02:08:50.689 --> 02:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
there and causing all sorts of trouble
 
02:08:52.609 --> 02:08:52.619 align:start position:0%
well they're not affected by this they
 
02:08:54.350 --> 02:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
can still have you know 10 people show
 
02:08:56.030 --> 02:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
up and live there because they're not a
 
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
place with two or more rooms
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
so they're exempt from this whereas the
 
02:09:01.850 --> 02:09:01.860 align:start position:0%
hotels they don't have that problem will
 
02:09:03.169 --> 02:09:03.179 align:start position:0%
have to follow it so I think that's
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
inappropriate thank you
 
02:09:08.270 --> 02:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and those are good points
 
02:09:09.470 --> 02:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
committee will take those under
 
02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:10.990 align:start position:0%
committee will take those under
advisement

02:09:10.990 --> 02:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
advisement
 
02:09:14.030 --> 02:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
02:09:16.010 --> 02:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just have one
 
02:09:18.410 --> 02:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
question you you referenced a bill that
 
02:09:19.729 --> 02:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
was in front of this committee could you
 
02:09:21.709 --> 02:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
do that just give me that number again
 
02:09:24.169 --> 02:09:24.179 align:start position:0%
HP 89 relative to posthumous
 
02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
exonerations and annulments
 
02:09:29.589 --> 02:09:29.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:32.089 --> 02:09:32.099 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:34.970 --> 02:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
is there any further anyone else wishing
 
02:09:36.350 --> 02:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
to testifying this bill who has not done
 
02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:37.609 align:start position:0%
to testifying this bill who has not done
so

02:09:37.609 --> 02:09:37.619 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:39.470 --> 02:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
there'd be none I hereby close public
 
02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:43.340 align:start position:0%
there'd be none I hereby close public
hearing

02:09:43.340 --> 02:09:43.350 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:48.050 align:start position:0%

02:14:14.209 --> 02:14:14.219 align:start position:0%
this point of open a public hearing on
 
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 245. no excuse me
 
02:14:21.530 --> 02:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 81.
 
02:14:24.129 --> 02:14:24.139 align:start position:0%
and I recognize
 
02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:32.089 --> 02:14:32.099 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Roy members of the
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
02:14:35.330 --> 02:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
Jenny Horgan I am the Senate minority
 
02:14:37.370 --> 02:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
policy director and I'm here introducing
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 81 on behalf of Senator
 
02:14:41.209 --> 02:14:41.219 align:start position:0%
Apprentice she has unfortunately has
 
02:14:42.649 --> 02:14:42.659 align:start position:0%
another bill scheduled at the same time
 
02:14:46.069 --> 02:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
across the hall so Senate Bill 81 sets a
 
02:14:48.109 --> 02:14:48.119 align:start position:0%
level for alcohol ignition interlock
 
02:14:52.250 --> 02:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
devices at 0.020 and was filed at the
 
02:14:53.930 --> 02:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
request of the Department of Safety and
 
02:14:56.030 --> 02:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
Joe Carr New Hampshire is an ignition
 
02:14:58.609 --> 02:14:58.619 align:start position:0%
interlock program requires that any
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
person whose license has been revoked or
 
02:15:03.709 --> 02:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
suspended for an aggravated DWI or
 
02:15:06.169 --> 02:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
convicted of a second or subsequent DWI
 
02:15:09.229 --> 02:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
to install ignition interlock device in
 
02:15:11.689 --> 02:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
any vehicle registered or used by that
 
02:15:14.209 --> 02:15:14.219 align:start position:0%
person for 12 to 24 months the device
 
02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
prevents the vehicle from starting
 
02:15:17.330 --> 02:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
unless the person provides a breast
 
02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
sample with a concentration of alcohol
 
02:15:21.050 --> 02:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
that is below that preset level
 
02:15:22.850 --> 02:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
again this legislation was filed at the
 
02:15:24.290 --> 02:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
request of gel Carr who worked with
 
02:15:26.330 --> 02:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
rules to address the installation of the
 
02:15:29.149 --> 02:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
devices during the summer of 2022 so
 
02:15:29.990 --> 02:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and
 
02:15:32.089 --> 02:15:32.099 align:start position:0%
consideration as soon as the senator is
 
02:15:33.709 --> 02:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
finished testifying across the hall
 
02:15:35.149 --> 02:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
she's going to race right over here
 
02:15:37.129 --> 02:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you have but
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
we will note that director marasco from
 
02:15:41.930 --> 02:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
dos is in the audience and does plan to
 
02:15:43.790 --> 02:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
testify he would be best suited to
 
02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
answer any technical questions
 
02:15:48.050 --> 02:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
and that concludes my testimony thank
 
02:15:51.890 --> 02:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:53.149 align:start position:0%
 
this

02:15:53.149 --> 02:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes John Bailey Jen Bailey
 
02:16:07.370 --> 02:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:09.410 --> 02:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
are you Mr marasco you'll be testifying
 
02:16:17.870 --> 02:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:19.609 --> 02:16:19.619 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
02:16:21.290 --> 02:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
committee uh thank you for allowing us
 
02:16:23.089 --> 02:16:23.099 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify before you
 
02:16:25.729 --> 02:16:25.739 align:start position:0%
this morning my name is John marasco I'm
 
02:16:26.930 --> 02:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
the director of The Division of Motor
 
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
Vehicles and I'm here with Jennifer
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
Bailey who is the administrator who
 
02:16:33.169 --> 02:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
oversees financial responsibility at the
 
02:16:35.150 --> 02:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
DMV I would like to thank Senator
 
02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
Prentice for sponsoring this bill as was
 
02:16:41.509 --> 02:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
testified to jail Cara recommended that
 
02:16:43.610 --> 02:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
this bill will be put forth and
 
02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
basically what it allows for sir is it
 
02:16:49.070 --> 02:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
allows for the DMV rule set with a set
 
02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
point a .020 to align with what we're
 
02:16:57.169 --> 02:16:57.179 align:start position:0%
trying to add here to the RSA the the
 
02:17:00.889 --> 02:17:00.899 align:start position:0%
set point of .020 is a Nitsa national
 
02:17:03.070 --> 02:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
highway traffic safety administration
 
02:17:06.770 --> 02:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
set point or preset standard which means
 
02:17:09.049 --> 02:17:09.059 align:start position:0%
when somebody blows into that device at
 
02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
that .020 threshold the vehicle will not
 
02:17:15.950 --> 02:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
start it should be noted that the actual
 
02:17:18.770 --> 02:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
violation which is in the statute
 
02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
currently anything that is greater than
 
02:17:26.030 --> 02:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
a .025 will register as a violation so
 
02:17:27.589 --> 02:17:27.599 align:start position:0%
some of the conversation that occurred
 
02:17:30.650 --> 02:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
before jailcar was
 
02:17:34.009 --> 02:17:34.019 align:start position:0%
the DMV rule set has a 0.020 but that's
 
02:17:37.969 --> 02:17:37.979 align:start position:0%
less than the .025 violation we're
 
02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
trying to have both documents have the
 
02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
same information the benefit of
 
02:17:45.230 --> 02:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
migrating to the point zero two zero is
 
02:17:48.530 --> 02:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
uh one it meets the Nitza standard two
 
02:17:50.509 --> 02:17:50.519 align:start position:0%
it aligns with the DMV rule set and
 
02:17:53.870 --> 02:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
three currently right now for those that
 
02:17:55.250 --> 02:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
would be on the program that are under
 
02:17:58.490 --> 02:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
the age of 21 their threshold for a DWI
 
02:18:02.209 --> 02:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
with being .020 if we keep it in the RSA
 
02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
that it just stays at a point zero two
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
five or greater you could run the risk
 
02:18:08.750 --> 02:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
of a juvenile that's on the program
 
02:18:14.450 --> 02:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
blowing a 0.020 and actually legally
 
02:18:17.330 --> 02:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
driving the car we don't want that so
 
02:18:19.669 --> 02:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
adding this to the RSA captures that as
 
02:18:21.650 --> 02:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
well so it's a really good addition to
 
02:18:23.889 --> 02:18:23.899 align:start position:0%
the RSA and we fully support it
 
02:18:26.330 --> 02:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
administrator Bailey oversees the
 
02:18:27.889 --> 02:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
program so if you have any specific
 
02:18:29.870 --> 02:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
questions I know Jen is happy to answer
 
02:18:33.049 --> 02:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:37.009 --> 02:18:37.019 align:start position:0%
um just out of curiosity why is it .020
 
02:18:39.049 --> 02:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
not just point zero is that something
 
02:18:40.810 --> 02:18:40.820 align:start position:0%
that's just not technically feasible
 
02:18:43.730 --> 02:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
does everyone have a certain amount of
 
02:18:43.740 --> 02:18:44.929 align:start position:0%
does everyone have a certain amount of
alcohol

02:18:44.929 --> 02:18:44.939 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
02:18:47.150 --> 02:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
that's a great question my understanding
 
02:18:49.669 --> 02:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
on that sir is that it's a it's an
 
02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
industry standard most of the devices
 
02:18:54.230 --> 02:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
although they can be recalibrated my
 
02:18:57.349 --> 02:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the .020 set point
 
02:19:00.650 --> 02:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
not only is what Nitsa recommends but I
 
02:19:02.089 --> 02:19:02.099 align:start position:0%
think they recommend that because the
 
02:19:03.889 --> 02:19:03.899 align:start position:0%
industry that's the standard that
 
02:19:06.830 --> 02:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:09.469 --> 02:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
represent wheeler I have some curiosity
 
02:19:11.089 --> 02:19:11.099 align:start position:0%
too thank you Mr chairman
 
02:19:13.610 --> 02:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
just really what how long have these
 
02:19:15.770 --> 02:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
devices been in use how long have we
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
been using the uh the ignition
 
02:19:20.570 --> 02:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
interlocked preset device that's a great
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
question I have the literature on it
 
02:19:23.570 --> 02:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
Jen's working with it every day so if
 
02:19:26.270 --> 02:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
you want want to take that jump
 
02:19:27.650 --> 02:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone thank you for
 
02:19:28.969 --> 02:19:28.979 align:start position:0%
having us
 
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
um so great question we have been using
 
02:19:34.969 --> 02:19:34.979 align:start position:0%
interlock devices since about 2012.
 
02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
um we have recently expanded that at any
 
02:19:40.969 --> 02:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
given time right now we have about 1300
 
02:19:44.690 --> 02:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
devices actively being used by residents
 
02:19:47.330 --> 02:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so we had looked to
 
02:19:49.610 --> 02:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
expand the rules to meet certain
 
02:19:51.410 --> 02:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
guidelines and this is one of those
 
02:19:54.110 --> 02:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
things that we did with emergency rule
 
02:19:55.849 --> 02:19:55.859 align:start position:0%
making and that's when gel car
 
02:19:58.250 --> 02:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
recommended that we match our law with
 
02:19:58.260 --> 02:19:59.150 align:start position:0%
recommended that we match our law with
that

02:19:59.150 --> 02:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:00.590 align:start position:0%
that
oh

02:20:00.590 --> 02:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:20:03.110 --> 02:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
I missed you said 1300 devices in use
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:09.410 --> 02:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions thank you
 
02:20:11.090 --> 02:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony thank you
 
02:20:12.410 --> 02:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:14.270 --> 02:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
is anyone else here wishes to test found
 
02:20:16.370 --> 02:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
this bill was not done so
 
02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know when I hear if I close the
 
02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
public hearing and we will be in recess
 
03:41:17.870 --> 03:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:17.880 --> 03:41:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:41:19.030 --> 03:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
decomposure structural damage to the
 
03:41:23.450 --> 03:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
home from the decomposing of the body
 
03:41:25.790 --> 03:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
biological risks from toxic fumes
 
03:41:27.950 --> 03:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
emitted from the decomposed Financial
 
03:41:30.410 --> 03:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
loss includes monies spent on hazardous
 
03:41:32.809 --> 03:41:32.819 align:start position:0%
cleaning crews repayment of Maryland's
 
03:41:34.550 --> 03:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
pension checks that Craig continued to
 
03:41:36.410 --> 03:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
benefit from Over the period of her
 
03:41:38.809 --> 03:41:38.819 align:start position:0%
concealed death and the loss of our
 
03:41:41.570 --> 03:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
family's Real Estate Value in her home
 
03:41:43.490 --> 03:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:41:47.510 --> 03:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
and sentimental artifacts these are just
 
03:41:48.889 --> 03:41:48.899 align:start position:0%
a few examples from my personal
 
03:41:51.410 --> 03:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
experience of this situation the
 
03:41:53.870 --> 03:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
financial cost emotional emotional toll
 
03:41:56.150 --> 03:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
and time spent by law enforcement on
 
03:41:57.950 --> 03:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
this case could have been avoided if
 
03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
officials were notified of her death as
 
03:42:02.330 --> 03:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
soon as possible and able to handle it
 
03:42:02.340 --> 03:42:03.769 align:start position:0%
soon as possible and able to handle it
properly

03:42:03.769 --> 03:42:03.779 align:start position:0%
properly
 
03:42:06.889 --> 03:42:06.899 align:start position:0%
if caretakers family members or both are
 
03:42:09.410 --> 03:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
unable to report a death we need to ask
 
03:42:09.420 --> 03:42:10.309 align:start position:0%
unable to report a death we need to ask
why

03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
why
 
03:42:12.110 --> 03:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
it is my belief that there is no
 
03:42:14.510 --> 03:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
altruistic reason to conceal a person's
 
03:42:17.090 --> 03:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
death and that more Sinister reasons lay
 
03:42:19.550 --> 03:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
beyond the actions of hiding it as
 
03:42:21.950 --> 03:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
members of society it is our duty to the
 
03:42:24.349 --> 03:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
deceased to protect and honor them just
 
03:42:25.969 --> 03:42:25.979 align:start position:0%
as we would the living
 
03:42:27.590 --> 03:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
this is something I wish I had the
 
03:42:29.809 --> 03:42:29.819 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do immediately upon the
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
death of my grandmother
 
03:42:33.950 --> 03:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
she was not just my grandmother she was
 
03:42:37.130 --> 03:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
also my best friend it was very very it
 
03:42:39.769 --> 03:42:39.779 align:start position:0%
continues to be very hard I want to
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and your
 
03:42:42.650 --> 03:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
consideration of your support of this
 
03:42:45.170 --> 03:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
bill and in closing I ask that if given
 
03:42:46.910 --> 03:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
the opportunity
 
03:42:50.809 --> 03:42:50.819 align:start position:0%
humbly we could name the bill or law
 
03:42:53.030 --> 03:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
after her Maryland
 
03:42:57.290 --> 03:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:59.269 --> 03:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions for me
 
03:42:59.279 --> 03:43:00.710 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions for me
or

03:43:00.710 --> 03:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:43:00.720 --> 03:43:01.809 align:start position:0%
or
anything

03:43:01.809 --> 03:43:01.819 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:43:05.389 --> 03:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:07.790 --> 03:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
thanks for questioning I'm sorry about
 
03:43:09.530 --> 03:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
everything that happened
 
03:43:11.030 --> 03:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
um have you been able to obtain any
 
03:43:14.929 --> 03:43:14.939 align:start position:0%
restitution from Craig
 
03:43:17.929 --> 03:43:17.939 align:start position:0%
um currently I have sought legal counsel
 
03:43:21.889 --> 03:43:21.899 align:start position:0%
and I'm working with my lawyer and the
 
03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
trustee of Maryland's estate to
 
03:43:28.070 --> 03:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
try to handle this situation
 
03:43:28.080 --> 03:43:29.330 align:start position:0%
try to handle this situation
um

03:43:29.330 --> 03:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:31.849 --> 03:43:31.859 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because there's not laws
 
03:43:35.090 --> 03:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
in place that say what he did was a
 
03:43:35.100 --> 03:43:35.929 align:start position:0%
in place that say what he did was a
crime

03:43:35.929 --> 03:43:35.939 align:start position:0%
crime
 
03:43:35.939 --> 03:43:36.590 align:start position:0%
crime
um

03:43:36.590 --> 03:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:40.070 --> 03:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
there's it's been quite a battle
 
03:43:42.469 --> 03:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
of course yeah
 
03:43:46.130 --> 03:43:46.140 align:start position:0%
um just quickly was was did he also take
 
03:43:47.750 --> 03:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
Social Security checks that we're going
 
03:43:49.010 --> 03:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
to her so
 
03:43:51.349 --> 03:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
so the trustee which was
 
03:43:53.450 --> 03:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
which was so her
 
03:43:55.309 --> 03:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
New York state school system and then
 
03:43:57.229 --> 03:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
also Social Security and everything that
 
03:43:59.929 --> 03:43:59.939 align:start position:0%
had been checked cashed was paid back by
 
03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
that or taken care of by the trustee
 
03:44:04.670 --> 03:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
um and so there is a little Nuance of
 
03:44:07.729 --> 03:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
did Craig commit a crime financially
 
03:44:10.010 --> 03:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
because he was still benefiting from her
 
03:44:12.889 --> 03:44:12.899 align:start position:0%
monthly income that was coming in
 
03:44:15.769 --> 03:44:15.779 align:start position:0%
um because he is a beneficiary of her
 
03:44:18.710 --> 03:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
estate in the long run that is arguably
 
03:44:18.720 --> 03:44:19.790 align:start position:0%
estate in the long run that is arguably
not

03:44:19.790 --> 03:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:44:23.510 --> 03:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
a big issue I guess for you know lack of
 
03:44:26.330 --> 03:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much yeah I think I
 
03:44:27.650 --> 03:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
think we have everything we need thank
 
03:44:31.969 --> 03:44:31.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:43.210 --> 03:44:43.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:46.370 --> 03:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you my name is
 
03:44:48.050 --> 03:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
Jenny Duval I'm the chief medical
 
03:44:50.389 --> 03:44:50.399 align:start position:0%
examiner and
 
03:44:52.550 --> 03:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
um first let me say that I fully support
 
03:44:56.750 --> 03:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended in the in the
 
03:45:00.050 --> 03:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
document as we're passing around the my
 
03:45:02.950 --> 03:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
only uh concern is where the amendment
 
03:45:08.330 --> 03:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
is is um is placed in the statute
 
03:45:11.630 --> 03:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
um by placing it under the office of the
 
03:45:13.729 --> 03:45:13.739 align:start position:0%
chief medical examiner statute statute
 
03:45:18.110 --> 03:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
611 you are restricting the amendment to
 
03:45:21.290 --> 03:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
Medical legal deaths and medical legal
 
03:45:23.870 --> 03:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
deaths are not all deaths in in the
 
03:45:26.870 --> 03:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
state they are deaths that fall under
 
03:45:30.170 --> 03:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
the statute which is 611 b11 there are
 
03:45:35.229 --> 03:45:35.239 align:start position:0%
26 different scenarios or circumstances
 
03:45:37.309 --> 03:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
surrounding a death that mandate
 
03:45:39.889 --> 03:45:39.899 align:start position:0%
reporting it to the medical examiner
 
03:45:43.130 --> 03:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
but most deaths do not fall under those
 
03:45:43.140 --> 03:45:44.530 align:start position:0%
but most deaths do not fall under those
26

03:45:44.530 --> 03:45:44.540 align:start position:0%
26
 
03:45:48.410 --> 03:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
scenarios so if you want to capture all
 
03:45:51.349 --> 03:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
deaths that occur and say all deaths
 
03:45:53.929 --> 03:45:53.939 align:start position:0%
must be reported then it can't be in my
 
03:45:56.090 --> 03:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
statute and it can't reference medical
 
03:45:57.769 --> 03:45:57.779 align:start position:0%
legal cases
 
03:46:01.010 --> 03:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
and that's why I think this amendment
 
03:46:03.969 --> 03:46:03.979 align:start position:0%
um fits better under under
 
03:46:09.110 --> 03:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
the 644 colon 7 which is the abuse of a
 
03:46:12.170 --> 03:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
corpse statute so that refers to any
 
03:46:15.469 --> 03:46:15.479 align:start position:0%
deceased person whose death occurred
 
03:46:17.450 --> 03:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
under any circumstances
 
03:46:19.429 --> 03:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
so I just think it fits better in that
 
03:46:22.610 --> 03:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
statute my other concern is that by by
 
03:46:25.490 --> 03:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
placing it under 611 the medical
 
03:46:27.110 --> 03:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
examiner statute there could be
 
03:46:29.570 --> 03:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences to that would
 
03:46:31.550 --> 03:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
adversely affect our ability to
 
03:46:33.229 --> 03:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
investigate deaths
 
03:46:33.239 --> 03:46:34.490 align:start position:0%
investigate deaths
so

03:46:34.490 --> 03:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:37.190 --> 03:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you Doctor
 
03:46:39.170 --> 03:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
um did you raise these concerns to the
 
03:46:41.030 --> 03:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
Senate while this was over there or is
 
03:46:42.349 --> 03:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
this something that came up late in the
 
03:46:42.359 --> 03:46:43.070 align:start position:0%
this something that came up late in the
game

03:46:43.070 --> 03:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
game
 
03:46:45.229 --> 03:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I wasn't aware at the time
 
03:46:47.510 --> 03:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
that it was it was going through the
 
03:46:47.520 --> 03:46:48.769 align:start position:0%
that it was it was going through the
Senate

03:46:48.769 --> 03:46:48.779 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
03:46:51.229 --> 03:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
um we did raise some concerns then and I
 
03:46:53.269 --> 03:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
believe the police testified at that
 
03:46:53.279 --> 03:46:54.769 align:start position:0%
believe the police testified at that
hearing

03:46:54.769 --> 03:46:54.779 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:46:56.590 --> 03:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
um but I'm not sure it was made clear
 
03:47:00.530 --> 03:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
that what all of my concerns were
 
03:47:02.090 --> 03:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes you have a
 
03:47:02.100 --> 03:47:03.170 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes you have a
question

03:47:03.170 --> 03:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:47:05.750 --> 03:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
dude thank you Mr chairman
 
03:47:07.729 --> 03:47:07.739 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if this is already the law
 
03:47:10.670 --> 03:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
or if this is verbiage for a new law but
 
03:47:13.370 --> 03:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
my question that I have is where it says
 
03:47:15.590 --> 03:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
finds remains which are thought to be
 
03:47:18.410 --> 03:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
thought to be human
 
03:47:21.170 --> 03:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
is that is is this what they're trying
 
03:47:22.190 --> 03:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
to make be a law because my only
 
03:47:24.410 --> 03:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
question is if I was walking along I I
 
03:47:26.510 --> 03:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
can assure you that I do not have the
 
03:47:29.090 --> 03:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
ability to try to decipher what may be
 
03:47:32.269 --> 03:47:32.279 align:start position:0%
human remains or or like animal
 
03:47:33.670 --> 03:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm not
 
03:47:36.769 --> 03:47:36.779 align:start position:0%
right I would think it should just be
 
03:47:36.779 --> 03:47:38.750 align:start position:0%
right I would think it should just be
reported

03:47:38.750 --> 03:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
reported
 
03:47:42.229 --> 03:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
right so the the proposed amendment the
 
03:47:44.030 --> 03:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the amendment
 
03:47:48.170 --> 03:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
um is uh is re refers to reporting
 
03:47:51.650 --> 03:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
failure to report the death of a person
 
03:47:53.630 --> 03:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
um so I think you know we're all
 
03:47:55.010 --> 03:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
thinking of
 
03:47:57.290 --> 03:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
and not skeletal remains or a single
 
03:48:00.769 --> 03:48:00.779 align:start position:0%
bone but we're thinking of a person who
 
03:48:02.870 --> 03:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
died and I think that the thought behind
 
03:48:05.030 --> 03:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is referring to a person who
 
03:48:06.830 --> 03:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
dies outside of a health care facility
 
03:48:09.590 --> 03:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
so someone who dies in a home
 
03:48:11.510 --> 03:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
um where someone who shares at home is
 
03:48:15.170 --> 03:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:16.969 --> 03:48:16.979 align:start position:0%
so the
 
03:48:20.990 --> 03:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
the 611 B12 would remain as is minus the
 
03:48:24.229 --> 03:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
the additions that were proposed is that
 
03:48:27.229 --> 03:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
correct that that would be my wish yes
 
03:48:28.969 --> 03:48:28.979 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:48:32.690 --> 03:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
from representative scitec
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment says a person is
 
03:48:36.830 --> 03:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
guilty of a misdemeanor
 
03:48:36.840 --> 03:48:39.530 align:start position:0%
guilty of a misdemeanor
uh

03:48:39.530 --> 03:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:42.769 --> 03:48:42.779 align:start position:0%
is that what person is responsible for
 
03:48:44.990 --> 03:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
how do you
 
03:48:48.410 --> 03:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
is the person has to be responsible for
 
03:48:52.010 --> 03:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
the care of this person and or if I'm if
 
03:48:53.570 --> 03:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
I'm hiking in the White Mountains and I
 
03:48:56.990 --> 03:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
see a remains am I required to am I that
 
03:48:59.269 --> 03:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
person I
 
03:49:03.290 --> 03:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
I I think person needs
 
03:49:05.809 --> 03:49:05.819 align:start position:0%
the amendment has a problem in my view
 
03:49:08.349 --> 03:49:08.359 align:start position:0%
with the person having a responsibility
 
03:49:13.969 --> 03:49:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:16.190 --> 03:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
yes I think you could certainly tweak
 
03:49:18.349 --> 03:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
the amendment I mean right off the bat
 
03:49:20.210 --> 03:49:20.220 align:start position:0%
the title of the amendment needs to be
 
03:49:22.070 --> 03:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
corrected because it still refers to a
 
03:49:23.389 --> 03:49:23.399 align:start position:0%
medical legal death
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
um and that's part of the problem
 
03:49:28.849 --> 03:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
um you can certainly tweak this
 
03:49:31.190 --> 03:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
amendment and
 
03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
make it more of of the responsible
 
03:49:33.600 --> 03:49:35.630 align:start position:0%
make it more of of the responsible
person

03:49:35.630 --> 03:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:49:37.790 --> 03:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
although maybe it should apply to anyone
 
03:49:40.550 --> 03:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
who's aware that there isn't a decedent
 
03:49:42.590 --> 03:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
and they're not reporting it probably
 
03:49:45.670 --> 03:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
should apply to everyone
 
03:49:48.530 --> 03:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
and that maybe accomplished just by
 
03:49:51.469 --> 03:49:51.479 align:start position:0%
saying whoever becomes aware of a death
 
03:49:53.389 --> 03:49:53.399 align:start position:0%
and it fails to report it something like
 
03:49:56.210 --> 03:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
that okay I think we got it
 
03:50:02.090 --> 03:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:03.590 --> 03:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
um thanks for taking my question could
 
03:50:06.590 --> 03:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
you define medical legal and maybe give
 
03:50:09.550 --> 03:50:09.560 align:start position:0%
us some examples of what's in
 
03:50:13.729 --> 03:50:13.739 align:start position:0%
611-b colon 11. yes so uh as I said and
 
03:50:15.290 --> 03:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
then to give the context of like why
 
03:50:17.929 --> 03:50:17.939 align:start position:0%
this isn't where this law should be
 
03:50:21.830 --> 03:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
understood so 6 11b 11 there are 26
 
03:50:25.429 --> 03:50:25.439 align:start position:0%
they're lettered a to X and they
 
03:50:28.190 --> 03:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
describe certain circumstances that
 
03:50:30.309 --> 03:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
mandate reporting to my office
 
03:50:33.729 --> 03:50:33.739 align:start position:0%
and they are things like
 
03:50:36.530 --> 03:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
deaths where there's some criminal
 
03:50:38.290 --> 03:50:38.300 align:start position:0%
activity involved
 
03:50:43.729 --> 03:50:43.739 align:start position:0%
any suicide any accident any homicide
 
03:50:47.150 --> 03:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
um any traffic related death any firearm
 
03:50:49.969 --> 03:50:49.979 align:start position:0%
related deaths any uh death that's a
 
03:50:52.550 --> 03:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
public health threat or potentially a
 
03:50:54.469 --> 03:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
public health threat
 
03:50:56.870 --> 03:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
um any uh poisoning death which would
 
03:50:59.389 --> 03:50:59.399 align:start position:0%
include all of the overdoses that we're
 
03:51:02.889 --> 03:51:02.899 align:start position:0%
seeing so it's it's targeted to
 
03:51:05.929 --> 03:51:05.939 align:start position:0%
non-natural Deaths so not deaths from
 
03:51:07.969 --> 03:51:07.979 align:start position:0%
natural disease it's targeting
 
03:51:10.670 --> 03:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
non-natural deaths or potentially
 
03:51:12.590 --> 03:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
natural deaths but in a young healthy
 
03:51:15.710 --> 03:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
person where death is not expected and
 
03:51:17.929 --> 03:51:17.939 align:start position:0%
where the death may not be natural or or
 
03:51:20.630 --> 03:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
maybe a public health threat so that's
 
03:51:22.610 --> 03:51:22.620 align:start position:0%
the the idea behind the statute and it's
 
03:51:25.849 --> 03:51:25.859 align:start position:0%
a good statute but it would not include
 
03:51:28.610 --> 03:51:28.620 align:start position:0%
your grandmother you know it would not
 
03:51:31.729 --> 03:51:31.739 align:start position:0%
include someone who has medical problems
 
03:51:36.050 --> 03:51:36.060 align:start position:0%
their death is not unexpected
 
03:51:38.030 --> 03:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
um persons who who die in their sleep
 
03:51:39.889 --> 03:51:39.899 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't necessarily have to be
 
03:51:42.830 --> 03:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
reported to my office unless they're not
 
03:51:45.229 --> 03:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
being followed by a physician or another
 
03:51:53.150 --> 03:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:55.790 --> 03:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so in your proposed amendment
 
03:51:59.330 --> 03:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
you're not referencing 611-b colon 11 at
 
03:52:01.250 --> 03:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
all and
 
03:52:04.490 --> 03:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:09.650 --> 03:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
um this paragraph 611 Dash B colon 12 is
 
03:52:12.530 --> 03:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
just a whole other unrelated thing to
 
03:52:14.269 --> 03:52:14.279 align:start position:0%
their situation and so we don't need to
 
03:52:16.070 --> 03:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
if we want to amend this we don't need
 
03:52:18.410 --> 03:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
to take any of the wording
 
03:52:22.570 --> 03:52:22.580 align:start position:0%
from the bill at all we can strike out
 
03:52:26.330 --> 03:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
the basically dump the bill as is write
 
03:52:28.010 --> 03:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
something new in a new section that
 
03:52:31.010 --> 03:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
captures the intent that yeah I think as
 
03:52:33.530 --> 03:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
long as you leave 611 out of it
 
03:52:39.170 --> 03:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:39.180 --> 03:52:41.450 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:52:41.450 --> 03:52:41.460 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:52:43.309 --> 03:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you very much for taking my
 
03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
question I'm I'm wondering
 
03:52:48.469 --> 03:52:48.479 align:start position:0%
whether it makes sense
 
03:52:51.229 --> 03:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
in some way to have both parts of this
 
03:52:51.239 --> 03:52:52.910 align:start position:0%
in some way to have both parts of this
where

03:52:52.910 --> 03:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:52:56.389 --> 03:52:56.399 align:start position:0%
um it would be a misdemeanor both to
 
03:52:59.210 --> 03:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
report a natural death in as in the case
 
03:53:01.190 --> 03:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
of of your grandmother and I'm very
 
03:53:03.349 --> 03:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
sorry for your loss but also
 
03:53:06.349 --> 03:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
the med sorry medical legal I'm sorry
 
03:53:08.330 --> 03:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
it's an awkward phrase for my mouth
 
03:53:11.150 --> 03:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
um death that you know essentially and I
 
03:53:13.370 --> 03:53:13.380 align:start position:0%
recognize that yours reference your
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
immense proposed amendment references
 
03:53:17.990 --> 03:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
any death but I'm wondering if we need
 
03:53:20.510 --> 03:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
to be more specific for any reason just
 
03:53:22.550 --> 03:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the legalities of
 
03:53:22.560 --> 03:53:23.769 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the legalities of
it

03:53:23.769 --> 03:53:23.779 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:53:26.690 --> 03:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
is there already a penalty for failing
 
03:53:29.929 --> 03:53:29.939 align:start position:0%
to comply with uh 611 uh it there is it
 
03:53:31.729 --> 03:53:31.739 align:start position:0%
says mandatory reporting but there's no
 
03:53:34.370 --> 03:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
penalty referenced so
 
03:53:36.530 --> 03:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean maybe maybe they should both
 
03:53:38.269 --> 03:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
be amended so that there's a penalty
 
03:53:40.070 --> 03:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
that exists in both
 
03:53:41.750 --> 03:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
but I still think you want to capture
 
03:53:44.389 --> 03:53:44.399 align:start position:0%
more than just medical legal cases with
 
03:53:49.130 --> 03:53:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:50.690 --> 03:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
see enough further questions thank you
 
03:53:53.990 --> 03:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:55.550 --> 03:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else wishing to testify
 
03:53:57.830 --> 03:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
did you want to add I saw you yeah sure
 
03:54:04.849 --> 03:54:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:07.070 --> 03:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
if there is a good point
 
03:54:08.410 --> 03:54:08.420 align:start position:0%
better under
 
03:54:11.950 --> 03:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
44-7 and changing the
 
03:54:15.650 --> 03:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
concealing a dead body misdemeanor to a
 
03:54:18.229 --> 03:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
felony and then adding the mandatory
 
03:54:20.389 --> 03:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
reporting rule which would Encompass all
 
03:54:22.610 --> 03:54:22.620 align:start position:0%
deaths and not put anybody in the
 
03:54:26.050 --> 03:54:26.060 align:start position:0%
medical profession at risk in any way
 
03:54:29.689 --> 03:54:29.699 align:start position:0%
kind of sounds like the best
 
03:54:30.950 --> 03:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
um so that's just the comment I wanted
 
03:54:33.229 --> 03:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
to make okay thank you
 
03:54:35.870 --> 03:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else wishing to testify
 
03:54:37.910 --> 03:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
there'd be none I hereby close public
 
03:54:40.309 --> 03:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
hearing and we'll be in recess until 1
 
03:54:40.319 --> 03:54:43.670 align:start position:0%
hearing and we'll be in recess until 1

03:54:45.530 --> 03:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
145
 
03:54:47.330 --> 03:54:47.340 align:start position:0%
why did I give so much time and it
 
04:21:39.710 --> 04:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:39.720 --> 04:21:40.849 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:21:40.849 --> 04:21:40.859 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:21:42.650 --> 04:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
at this point I'm open in a public
 
04:21:46.130 --> 04:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill 209
 
04:21:49.189 --> 04:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
and I recognize
 
04:22:01.969 --> 04:22:01.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:04.910 --> 04:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Mr chair
 
04:22:06.290 --> 04:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
it's good to see everyone good afternoon
 
04:22:08.030 --> 04:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:22:09.830 --> 04:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
my name is Becky Whitley I'm honored to
 
04:22:11.689 --> 04:22:11.699 align:start position:0%
represent Senate District 15 which
 
04:22:13.550 --> 04:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
includes the wonderful communities of
 
04:22:15.530 --> 04:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
Beau Concord Penacook and Hopkinton
 
04:22:17.689 --> 04:22:17.699 align:start position:0%
today I'm proud to introduce Senate Bill
 
04:22:22.070 --> 04:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
209 a bill ensuring menstrual equity in
 
04:22:23.450 --> 04:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
all of our New Hampshire Correctional
 
04:22:23.460 --> 04:22:24.530 align:start position:0%
all of our New Hampshire Correctional
settings

04:22:24.530 --> 04:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
settings
 
04:22:26.510 --> 04:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
so I understand that this committee is
 
04:22:29.030 --> 04:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
pretty familiar with this topic
 
04:22:31.189 --> 04:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
um and I'm grateful to bring for the
 
04:22:33.410 --> 04:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
Senate version and in my opinion this
 
04:22:36.769 --> 04:22:36.779 align:start position:0%
bill supports basic human dignity for
 
04:22:39.170 --> 04:22:39.180 align:start position:0%
women in our County jails our state
 
04:22:40.790 --> 04:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
prisons and our juvenile correction
 
04:22:43.610 --> 04:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
facilities this bill acknowledges that
 
04:22:45.830 --> 04:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
For Those Behind Bars there are some
 
04:22:47.870 --> 04:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessary hurdles to coping with
 
04:22:51.110 --> 04:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
menstruation and managing periods in a
 
04:22:53.570 --> 04:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
healthy and hygienic way so I'm really
 
04:22:56.389 --> 04:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
grateful that this bill was the
 
04:22:59.630 --> 04:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
culmination of work with Advocates with
 
04:23:01.309 --> 04:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
the um the commissioner from the
 
04:23:04.490 --> 04:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and this bill
 
04:23:07.670 --> 04:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
was designed to align actually with an
 
04:23:09.349 --> 04:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
existing policy that the Department of
 
04:23:11.929 --> 04:23:11.939 align:start position:0%
Corrections already has that works to
 
04:23:13.910 --> 04:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
ensure the safety of residents and staff
 
04:23:16.670 --> 04:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
will also ensuring menstrual Equity we
 
04:23:17.929 --> 04:23:17.939 align:start position:0%
also consulted with the county
 
04:23:19.670 --> 04:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
superintendents and got their input on
 
04:23:21.110 --> 04:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
language and I want to thank everyone
 
04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
who was involved in their partnership
 
04:23:24.410 --> 04:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
for this work
 
04:23:26.030 --> 04:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
I think this bill is really important
 
04:23:28.010 --> 04:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
and the subject is really important
 
04:23:31.189 --> 04:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
because menstruation is natural it's a
 
04:23:33.170 --> 04:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
natural monthly occurrence experienced
 
04:23:35.570 --> 04:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
by half the population for much of their
 
04:23:37.370 --> 04:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
lives and it should not be treated
 
04:23:39.710 --> 04:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
differently than any other basic bodily
 
04:23:41.929 --> 04:23:41.939 align:start position:0%
function menstruation is not something
 
04:23:44.750 --> 04:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
to be ashamed of however there is so
 
04:23:46.790 --> 04:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
much stigma stigma and silence around
 
04:23:47.990 --> 04:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
the topic
 
04:23:50.689 --> 04:23:50.699 align:start position:0%
menstrual products like tampons and pads
 
04:23:52.729 --> 04:23:52.739 align:start position:0%
are vital for the health well-being and
 
04:23:54.969 --> 04:23:54.979 align:start position:0%
full participation of women and girls
 
04:23:57.469 --> 04:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
inadequate menstrual support has often
 
04:23:59.750 --> 04:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
been associated with both health and
 
04:24:01.729 --> 04:24:01.739 align:start position:0%
psychosocial issues particularly among
 
04:24:04.309 --> 04:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
our low-income residents
 
04:24:06.889 --> 04:24:06.899 align:start position:0%
lack of access to menstrual products has
 
04:24:08.630 --> 04:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
all can also take a severe emotional
 
04:24:11.809 --> 04:24:11.819 align:start position:0%
toll especially if residents are too
 
04:24:14.030 --> 04:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
embarrassed to take part in daily life
 
04:24:16.670 --> 04:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
within the prison or facility
 
04:24:18.650 --> 04:24:18.660 align:start position:0%
incarcerated people are in the custody
 
04:24:21.349 --> 04:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
of the state and of course rely entirely
 
04:24:23.929 --> 04:24:23.939 align:start position:0%
on prison or jail staff to meet their
 
04:24:26.450 --> 04:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
medical and hygiene needs including the
 
04:24:28.790 --> 04:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
provision of menstrual products the
 
04:24:30.710 --> 04:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
ability to manage menstruation should
 
04:24:33.830 --> 04:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
not be a bonus a reward an entitlement
 
04:24:37.130 --> 04:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
or a favor to be begged or bargained for
 
04:24:39.769 --> 04:24:39.779 align:start position:0%
and that's where this bill comes in
 
04:24:42.410 --> 04:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
this bill takes away that power Dynamic
 
04:24:44.570 --> 04:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
and provides for the provision of the
 
04:24:47.210 --> 04:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
same basic amount of Mentor products for
 
04:24:49.610 --> 04:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
all residents there's also some
 
04:24:51.889 --> 04:24:51.899 align:start position:0%
flexibility built in depending on an
 
04:24:54.410 --> 04:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
individual's unique needs those who
 
04:24:56.570 --> 04:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
menstrate on the panel may know full
 
04:24:58.610 --> 04:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
well that periods can be unpredictable
 
04:25:01.309 --> 04:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
and that not all people menstruate in
 
04:25:03.590 --> 04:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
the same way some people have light
 
04:25:06.050 --> 04:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
flows for a few days while others have a
 
04:25:08.090 --> 04:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
heavier flow for a full week
 
04:25:10.070 --> 04:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
I want to point out that the cost of
 
04:25:11.889 --> 04:25:11.899 align:start position:0%
menstrual products is really negligible
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
when compared to the cost of actually
 
04:25:16.790 --> 04:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
running the facilities and the
 
04:25:17.929 --> 04:25:17.939 align:start position:0%
government already pays for other
 
04:25:20.389 --> 04:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
necessities like toilet paper we don't
 
04:25:22.189 --> 04:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
charge for toilet paper so we shouldn't
 
04:25:24.290 --> 04:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
be charging for menstrual products
 
04:25:26.389 --> 04:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
this bill I think at its core highlights
 
04:25:29.330 --> 04:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
that it's a core human need even and
 
04:25:31.429 --> 04:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
most especially for people in custody
 
04:25:34.070 --> 04:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
and should be treated as such I'm happy
 
04:25:36.410 --> 04:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
to take any questions and I respectfully
 
04:25:38.330 --> 04:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
ask for the committee's support of this
 
04:25:40.550 --> 04:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
bill I will note that this Bill had
 
04:25:42.410 --> 04:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
unanimous support both in the senate
 
04:25:45.290 --> 04:25:45.300 align:start position:0%
committee and on the senate floor it was
 
04:25:47.210 --> 04:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
amended at the request of a number of
 
04:25:48.710 --> 04:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
folks including our commissioner to
 
04:25:49.849 --> 04:25:49.859 align:start position:0%
include our juvenile correction
 
04:25:51.710 --> 04:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
facilities of which of course we have
 
04:25:51.720 --> 04:25:53.090 align:start position:0%
facilities of which of course we have
girls

04:25:53.090 --> 04:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
girls
 
04:25:55.429 --> 04:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
um so that's the biggest Amendment and I
 
04:25:57.170 --> 04:25:57.180 align:start position:0%
think there's a few differences that I'm
 
04:25:58.790 --> 04:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
happy to discuss with the house version
 
04:26:01.189 --> 04:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
if that would if that makes a lot of
 
04:26:02.689 --> 04:26:02.699 align:start position:0%
sense so
 
04:26:02.699 --> 04:26:03.530 align:start position:0%
sense so
um

04:26:03.530 --> 04:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:06.889 --> 04:26:06.899 align:start position:0%
there is a a line in the house version
 
04:26:09.290 --> 04:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
that talks about the provision of
 
04:26:09.300 --> 04:26:10.790 align:start position:0%
that talks about the provision of
underwear

04:26:10.790 --> 04:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
underwear
 
04:26:13.250 --> 04:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
um and I certainly would be happy to add
 
04:26:14.689 --> 04:26:14.699 align:start position:0%
that to the Senate version as well I
 
04:26:16.729 --> 04:26:16.739 align:start position:0%
think that was a great Amendment
 
04:26:18.830 --> 04:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
um it's just not something that we we
 
04:26:20.809 --> 04:26:20.819 align:start position:0%
thought to include in ours so I think
 
04:26:23.990 --> 04:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
certainly I would would be open to that
 
04:26:26.269 --> 04:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
um I think in ours like I said in the
 
04:26:27.830 --> 04:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
Senate version we do include Juvenile
 
04:26:29.450 --> 04:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
Detention facilities I think that's an
 
04:26:32.290 --> 04:26:32.300 align:start position:0%
important thing we also actually Define
 
04:26:34.610 --> 04:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
what an adequate amount of menstrual
 
04:26:36.889 --> 04:26:36.899 align:start position:0%
products is we say that everyone
 
04:26:40.490 --> 04:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
everyone gets 20 right and then of
 
04:26:42.290 --> 04:26:42.300 align:start position:0%
course there's flexibility from there if
 
04:26:43.550 --> 04:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
I need more
 
04:26:45.469 --> 04:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
so I think naming that is really
 
04:26:48.050 --> 04:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
important because again if you name the
 
04:26:49.490 --> 04:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
number then you're taking away that
 
04:26:51.950 --> 04:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
bargaining power Dynamic so I think
 
04:26:53.750 --> 04:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
folks thought that naming that number
 
04:26:56.030 --> 04:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
and having that number in there was an
 
04:26:58.010 --> 04:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
important Baseline um and that is
 
04:26:59.510 --> 04:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
aligned with what the commissioner
 
04:27:01.250 --> 04:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
already uses in her facilities and I
 
04:27:04.130 --> 04:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
think she can speak to the importance of
 
04:27:06.769 --> 04:27:06.779 align:start position:0%
of naming and why that number was
 
04:27:08.330 --> 04:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
arrived at
 
04:27:08.340 --> 04:27:09.469 align:start position:0%
arrived at
um

04:27:09.469 --> 04:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:11.389 --> 04:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
so I think those are the major
 
04:27:11.399 --> 04:27:12.710 align:start position:0%
so I think those are the major
differences

04:27:12.710 --> 04:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
differences
 
04:27:14.349 --> 04:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
um there's some you know minor language
 
04:27:17.990 --> 04:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
issues that I'm happy to address we do
 
04:27:20.750 --> 04:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
Define menstrual hygiene products a
 
04:27:23.030 --> 04:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
little differently and that was
 
04:27:24.469 --> 04:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
um very intentional because I think
 
04:27:26.389 --> 04:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
there are certain menstrual products
 
04:27:28.189 --> 04:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
like cups
 
04:27:30.410 --> 04:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
um that perhaps may not be appropriate
 
04:27:31.790 --> 04:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
for Correctional settings and I thought
 
04:27:33.410 --> 04:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
that was fine and so that's why we were
 
04:27:35.809 --> 04:27:35.819 align:start position:0%
very particular in how we named witch
 
04:27:37.370 --> 04:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
meds for products we are talking about
 
04:27:39.590 --> 04:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
here so I will stop there I'm happy to
 
04:27:41.630 --> 04:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
take any questions and defer you know
 
04:27:43.429 --> 04:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
more technical questions to the able
 
04:27:45.170 --> 04:27:45.180 align:start position:0%
folks behind me
 
04:27:48.530 --> 04:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator um yeah the we we
 
04:27:52.330 --> 04:27:52.340 align:start position:0%
spent an amazing amount of time on this
 
04:27:55.490 --> 04:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
and delved into it pretty deeply so we
 
04:27:56.870 --> 04:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate the Senate doing the same
 
04:27:56.880 --> 04:27:57.590 align:start position:0%
appreciate the Senate doing the same
thing

04:27:57.590 --> 04:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:28:00.050 --> 04:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
and we'll definitely going to um
 
04:28:01.790 --> 04:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
compare these two and see which one is
 
04:28:03.290 --> 04:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
better for the the people that it
 
04:28:05.269 --> 04:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
protects any questions from the
 
04:28:07.010 --> 04:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
04:28:09.050 --> 04:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
I fear everyone here has had their fill
 
04:28:11.389 --> 04:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
of this talk hey you guys are letting me
 
04:28:13.849 --> 04:28:13.859 align:start position:0%
off easy yeah thank you very much for
 
04:28:15.170 --> 04:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
your time thank you thank you I
 
04:28:25.010 --> 04:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:26.389 --> 04:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
what do you need
 
04:28:28.969 --> 04:28:28.979 align:start position:0%

scullingbury thank you Mr chair
 
04:28:41.750 --> 04:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
my name is Anthony skull and Brady I'm a
 
04:28:43.550 --> 04:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
lawyer in Nashua I've been a lawyer for
 
04:28:46.070 --> 04:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
about 20 years some of the cases that
 
04:28:48.110 --> 04:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
I've taken in my career involve people
 
04:28:49.729 --> 04:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
that are incarcerated involved females
 
04:28:52.130 --> 04:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
that are incarcerated and on occasion I
 
04:28:55.610 --> 04:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
have uh sought compensation for people
 
04:28:59.090 --> 04:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
who are injured while in uh incarcerated
 
04:29:01.670 --> 04:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
some of the things that that some of the
 
04:29:02.809 --> 04:29:02.819 align:start position:0%
changes that were made between the
 
04:29:06.050 --> 04:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
Senate bill and the house bill I think
 
04:29:07.910 --> 04:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
are really good there's one change that
 
04:29:10.070 --> 04:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
I want to highlight in particular that I
 
04:29:13.070 --> 04:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
think is probably not the best approach
 
04:29:16.070 --> 04:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the fir the that changes eliminating
 
04:29:18.889 --> 04:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
the number of menstrual hygiene products
 
04:29:21.349 --> 04:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
per individual by setting it at a
 
04:29:23.030 --> 04:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable number as opposed to an
 
04:29:26.090 --> 04:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
actual number it it invites litigation
 
04:29:28.670 --> 04:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
that would be deleterious to the to the
 
04:29:31.550 --> 04:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
County Corrections facilities and to the
 
04:29:33.590 --> 04:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
State Prison I would note though that
 
04:29:36.410 --> 04:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
I've never had a complaint about this in
 
04:29:39.050 --> 04:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
any number of years as a lawyer out of
 
04:29:40.250 --> 04:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
the state prison and it's always been
 
04:29:41.830 --> 04:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
out of County facilities
 
04:29:45.170 --> 04:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
by putting a minimum number there it
 
04:29:47.330 --> 04:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
ensures not only that people get some
 
04:29:49.370 --> 04:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
and have them when they need them and
 
04:29:51.110 --> 04:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
maybe could even ration them themselves
 
04:29:54.250 --> 04:29:54.260 align:start position:0%
but it also eliminates this fuzziness
 
04:29:57.469 --> 04:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
that could invite litigation I would
 
04:29:59.030 --> 04:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
also note that this kind of litigation
 
04:30:02.030 --> 04:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
would be especially tempting because it
 
04:30:03.830 --> 04:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
would only apply to women so there would
 
04:30:05.450 --> 04:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
be Not only would there be an issue
 
04:30:10.550 --> 04:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
related to a 42 USC 1983 which is the
 
04:30:12.950 --> 04:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
federal statute that allows people to
 
04:30:15.769 --> 04:30:15.779 align:start position:0%
hold State officials uh
 
04:30:17.389 --> 04:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
accountable for violations of their
 
04:30:19.010 --> 04:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
federal constitutional rights but
 
04:30:20.809 --> 04:30:20.819 align:start position:0%
because it would only affect women it
 
04:30:22.550 --> 04:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
also have some equal protection
 
04:30:25.370 --> 04:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
components and so I would urge the
 
04:30:28.429 --> 04:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
original number to be restored and that
 
04:30:31.610 --> 04:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
way there is not this essentially uh red
 
04:30:34.130 --> 04:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
flag for litigation
 
04:30:37.250 --> 04:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions I hope
 
04:30:42.229 --> 04:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:43.969 --> 04:30:43.979 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
04:30:46.610 --> 04:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:10.969 --> 04:31:10.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:12.649 --> 04:31:12.659 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chair and members of the
 
04:31:14.269 --> 04:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Devin Quinn I'm the
 
04:31:15.649 --> 04:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
policy director for the New Hampshire
 
04:31:17.870 --> 04:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
women's Foundation we invest in
 
04:31:20.090 --> 04:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
opportunity and equality for the women
 
04:31:21.469 --> 04:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
and girls of New Hampshire through
 
04:31:23.530 --> 04:31:23.540 align:start position:0%
research advocacy
 
04:31:25.969 --> 04:31:25.979 align:start position:0%
and Grant making
 
04:31:25.979 --> 04:31:26.929 align:start position:0%
and Grant making
um

04:31:26.929 --> 04:31:26.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:31.330 --> 04:31:31.340 align:start position:0%
I have passed around two documents
 
04:31:34.070 --> 04:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
I know that this committee is very
 
04:31:35.630 --> 04:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
familiar with this issue is very
 
04:31:37.309 --> 04:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about this issue it's
 
04:31:39.790 --> 04:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
taken a lot of time
 
04:31:42.530 --> 04:31:42.540 align:start position:0%
and has a lot of empathy for this issue
 
04:31:45.889 --> 04:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
so I don't I will let um some of Ophelia
 
04:31:48.710 --> 04:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
Burnett's testimony speak for itself if
 
04:31:50.030 --> 04:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
you want to take a look at that Ophelia
 
04:31:53.450 --> 04:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
could not be here today but she has has
 
04:31:55.729 --> 04:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
been a wonderful Advocate on this issue
 
04:31:58.130 --> 04:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
and presents a lot of experiences of
 
04:32:00.170 --> 04:32:00.180 align:start position:0%
individuals who experience this issue so
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make sure that was in
 
04:32:04.309 --> 04:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
the record you had that with your time I
 
04:32:06.349 --> 04:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to just focus on the differences
 
04:32:07.849 --> 04:32:07.859 align:start position:0%
between the house bill and the Senate
 
04:32:09.410 --> 04:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
bill just to kind of get down to what's
 
04:32:11.090 --> 04:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
actually different about them since I
 
04:32:14.210 --> 04:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
know this is an issue you all support
 
04:32:17.330 --> 04:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
um the of so in the top here we have a
 
04:32:17.340 --> 04:32:18.290 align:start position:0%
um the of so in the top here we have a
little

04:32:18.290 --> 04:32:18.300 align:start position:0%
little
 
04:32:21.590 --> 04:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
um spreadsheet a little chart of What's
 
04:32:22.849 --> 04:32:22.859 align:start position:0%
um different about the House and Senate
 
04:32:26.149 --> 04:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
bills mostly um the rest is the same
 
04:32:28.010 --> 04:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
um all all of these three things that
 
04:32:29.570 --> 04:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
are different are really great and I
 
04:32:31.370 --> 04:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
think should probably be adopted into a
 
04:32:32.450 --> 04:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
final bill
 
04:32:36.110 --> 04:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh the house bill includes underwear and
 
04:32:37.429 --> 04:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
the Senate bill doesn't and I know
 
04:32:38.929 --> 04:32:38.939 align:start position:0%
that's something that this committee
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
really did great work in adding so I
 
04:32:45.130 --> 04:32:45.140 align:start position:0%
would recommend that you consider adding
 
04:32:48.290 --> 04:32:48.300 align:start position:0%
new underwear to the Senate version of
 
04:32:50.750 --> 04:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
this bill based on that work you did the
 
04:32:52.790 --> 04:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
only thing I might say is that I know
 
04:32:54.710 --> 04:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee when I watched that it
 
04:32:58.250 --> 04:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
you had wanted to do new underwear but
 
04:32:59.689 --> 04:32:59.699 align:start position:0%
then in the language it came out as in
 
04:33:01.849 --> 04:33:01.859 align:start position:0%
new condition so I don't know if that
 
04:33:04.131 --> 04:33:04.141 align:start position:0%
could be read as um
 
04:33:05.689 --> 04:33:05.699 align:start position:0%
if it was sanitize a new condition
 
04:33:07.730 --> 04:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
that's a question I have so just
 
04:33:09.650 --> 04:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
wondering if you wanted it to say new or
 
04:33:11.170 --> 04:33:11.180 align:start position:0%
new condition
 
04:33:14.449 --> 04:33:14.459 align:start position:0%
the Senate Bill includes
 
04:33:16.310 --> 04:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
um both of them include both bills
 
04:33:16.320 --> 04:33:17.289 align:start position:0%
um both of them include both bills
include

04:33:17.289 --> 04:33:17.299 align:start position:0%
include
 
04:33:19.730 --> 04:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
jails and the prison but the Senate Bill
 
04:33:22.310 --> 04:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
also includes Youth detention facilities
 
04:33:24.230 --> 04:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
the student Youth Center or whatever
 
04:33:28.209 --> 04:33:28.219 align:start position:0%
would be applicable in that RSA section
 
04:33:31.810 --> 04:33:31.820 align:start position:0%
so I would recommend you consider adding
 
04:33:34.310 --> 04:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
youth facilities as well because we know
 
04:33:37.670 --> 04:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
that people menstruate in Youth Services
 
04:33:39.590 --> 04:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:33:41.029 --> 04:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
um the final difference and which has
 
04:33:43.789 --> 04:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
been brought up a few times is um really
 
04:33:46.730 --> 04:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
defining adequacy as a number
 
04:33:50.090 --> 04:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
um adequacy and sufficiency so I know
 
04:33:53.150 --> 04:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
that in them the in the house
 
04:33:54.349 --> 04:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee there was a great
 
04:33:56.390 --> 04:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
discussion on timeliness
 
04:33:57.769 --> 04:33:57.779 align:start position:0%
um there's a discussion of should it be
 
04:33:59.510 --> 04:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
one hour or should it be a reasonable
 
04:34:01.310 --> 04:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
time or
 
04:34:03.949 --> 04:34:03.959 align:start position:0%
um uh different questions around
 
04:34:06.769 --> 04:34:06.779 align:start position:0%
timeliness which was really helpful I
 
04:34:11.390 --> 04:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
think when we get to the issue of why
 
04:34:13.490 --> 04:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
some folks are getting mental hygiene
 
04:34:16.070 --> 04:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
products in prisons and jails and some
 
04:34:18.830 --> 04:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
aren't it really comes down to that
 
04:34:20.990 --> 04:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
there's either a really a system or
 
04:34:23.090 --> 04:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
there's kind of a lack of a system and
 
04:34:27.590 --> 04:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
so the the women's prison and many jails
 
04:34:31.269 --> 04:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
have a a good practice a best practice
 
04:34:34.609 --> 04:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
where there's a standard amount in
 
04:34:37.070 --> 04:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
practice that that are handed out or
 
04:34:38.990 --> 04:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
doled out in efficient manner ever you
 
04:34:40.490 --> 04:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
know at the beginning of a four week
 
04:34:43.789 --> 04:34:43.799 align:start position:0%
period at the so that it meets with a
 
04:34:44.929 --> 04:34:44.939 align:start position:0%
menstrual cycle
 
04:34:47.990 --> 04:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's probably good for um prisons and
 
04:34:50.330 --> 04:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
jails I imagine because it's it's an
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
orderly fashion it's a functional system
 
04:34:54.949 --> 04:34:54.959 align:start position:0%
it's also really good for people who are
 
04:34:57.170 --> 04:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
incarcerated who menstruate because
 
04:34:59.150 --> 04:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
um they can count on those paths and
 
04:35:01.369 --> 04:35:01.379 align:start position:0%
tampons they can count on having them
 
04:35:02.810 --> 04:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
um ahead of time they don't have to wait
 
04:35:04.730 --> 04:35:04.740 align:start position:0%
until they're
 
04:35:07.490 --> 04:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
um on their period to ask and then on
 
04:35:10.250 --> 04:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
the other side is just a few gels that
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
are not in that system and it's really
 
04:35:14.650 --> 04:35:14.660 align:start position:0%
more of an ad hoc system
 
04:35:17.510 --> 04:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
and someone has to wait until they're in
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
need to ask wait for a corrections
 
04:35:22.910 --> 04:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
officer to come around ask for it wait
 
04:35:25.730 --> 04:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
to receive it it might not be in the
 
04:35:28.189 --> 04:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
amount or the type they need and they
 
04:35:29.750 --> 04:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
might go through that an hour later and
 
04:35:31.369 --> 04:35:31.379 align:start position:0%
need more and so it's kind of a system
 
04:35:32.949 --> 04:35:32.959 align:start position:0%
or an ad hoc system
 
04:35:37.070 --> 04:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
and sufficiency or adequacy really and
 
04:35:39.051 --> 04:35:39.061 align:start position:0%
timeliness are the issues having enough
 
04:35:42.109 --> 04:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
and having them at the right time and so
 
04:35:44.570 --> 04:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
the Senate version that actually puts a
 
04:35:46.789 --> 04:35:46.799 align:start position:0%
minimum number and to be clear this is a
 
04:35:50.869 --> 04:35:50.879 align:start position:0%
minimum number not a maximum or a or a
 
04:35:52.670 --> 04:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
specific only to that number it's a
 
04:35:55.250 --> 04:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
minimum number I think that's the only
 
04:36:00.131 --> 04:36:00.141 align:start position:0%
way that a number could actually achieve
 
04:36:04.490 --> 04:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
adequacy without as Tony had mentioned
 
04:36:06.830 --> 04:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
having to litigate what adequacy means
 
04:36:09.230 --> 04:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
or what sufficiency means because a
 
04:36:12.410 --> 04:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
corrections officer might think
 
04:36:14.769 --> 04:36:14.779 align:start position:0%
three tampons is sufficient or adequate
 
04:36:17.269 --> 04:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
and so if you're debating sufficiency
 
04:36:19.429 --> 04:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
and adequacy you're putting the very
 
04:36:21.650 --> 04:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
people we're trying to fix this issue
 
04:36:23.090 --> 04:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
for in a position where they would have
 
04:36:24.890 --> 04:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
to litigate that
 
04:36:26.689 --> 04:36:26.699 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
04:36:26.699 --> 04:36:27.289 align:start position:0%
so I think
um

04:36:27.289 --> 04:36:27.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:30.650 --> 04:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
by putting a number to it
 
04:36:32.750 --> 04:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know we thought about costs and I
 
04:36:33.830 --> 04:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
don't think that that's going to be
 
04:36:35.570 --> 04:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
burning some costs based on what I've
 
04:36:38.449 --> 04:36:38.459 align:start position:0%
heard from superintendents we thought
 
04:36:40.849 --> 04:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
about safety issues and that's why
 
04:36:43.189 --> 04:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
there's language in there about safety
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
and not having too many products in a
 
04:36:48.470 --> 04:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
Cell that's actually very near identical
 
04:36:50.349 --> 04:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
language in the House and Senate version
 
04:36:53.330 --> 04:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
but it does come down to um you know
 
04:36:56.330 --> 04:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
perhaps it would be burdensome for a
 
04:36:58.730 --> 04:36:58.740 align:start position:0%
jail to keep track of that number if
 
04:37:01.970 --> 04:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
they kept to that ad hoc system but
 
04:37:03.051 --> 04:37:03.061 align:start position:0%
that's really the point what we're
 
04:37:04.970 --> 04:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
trying to move away from is that it
 
04:37:06.830 --> 04:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
would no longer be burdensome to make
 
04:37:08.990 --> 04:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
sure they got a basic or minimum number
 
04:37:11.689 --> 04:37:11.699 align:start position:0%
if they implemented A system that we see
 
04:37:13.429 --> 04:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
as a best practice at the prison in many
 
04:37:17.510 --> 04:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:19.189 --> 04:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
so those are the three differences I'm
 
04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions I lay them out
 
04:37:28.010 --> 04:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:30.109 --> 04:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much for your
 
04:37:35.949 --> 04:37:35.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:38.810 --> 04:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
and the chair I recognizes commissioner
 
04:37:52.670 --> 04:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:54.769 --> 04:37:54.779 align:start position:0%
good afternoon a honorable committee for
 
04:37:56.269 --> 04:37:56.279 align:start position:0%
the record Helen Hanks commissioner of
 
04:37:58.310 --> 04:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections
 
04:38:01.310 --> 04:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
um uh it's really a an honor and a
 
04:38:03.289 --> 04:38:03.299 align:start position:0%
privilege when the state takes the
 
04:38:04.970 --> 04:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections long-standing
 
04:38:06.769 --> 04:38:06.779 align:start position:0%
practice and says this is so good it
 
04:38:08.869 --> 04:38:08.879 align:start position:0%
should be in law so whether you choose
 
04:38:10.429 --> 04:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
the house bill version or the Senate
 
04:38:13.250 --> 04:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
version we will continue to do the right
 
04:38:15.590 --> 04:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
thing by those who are in our facilities
 
04:38:18.051 --> 04:38:18.061 align:start position:0%
and who menstruate
 
04:38:20.631 --> 04:38:20.641 align:start position:0%
um I do want to just point out the
 
04:38:22.429 --> 04:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
differences between the two bill you we
 
04:38:24.590 --> 04:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
just talked about key areas for the
 
04:38:28.310 --> 04:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
Department are the definitions of a
 
04:38:30.170 --> 04:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
menstrual hygiene product that does have
 
04:38:32.330 --> 04:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
meaning we don't want products and that
 
04:38:34.330 --> 04:38:34.340 align:start position:0%
could be used as a tool to actually
 
04:38:39.230 --> 04:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
throw blood at people on line 16 of the
 
04:38:41.570 --> 04:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill I just want to point out
 
04:38:45.709 --> 04:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
this is a unintentional error on line 16
 
04:38:47.390 --> 04:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
it says the superintendent of each
 
04:38:49.449 --> 04:38:49.459 align:start position:0%
County correctional facility
 
04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
that should say the warden or director
 
04:38:58.369 --> 04:38:58.379 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:00.529 --> 04:39:00.539 align:start position:0%
just as a note
 
04:39:00.539 --> 04:39:03.051 align:start position:0%
just as a note
um

04:39:03.051 --> 04:39:03.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:05.449 --> 04:39:05.459 align:start position:0%
and the inclusion of of Youth is
 
04:39:06.949 --> 04:39:06.959 align:start position:0%
obviously incredibly important so
 
04:39:09.650 --> 04:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
whichever bill is ultimately the final
 
04:39:11.689 --> 04:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
bill you know the department is here to
 
04:39:13.789 --> 04:39:13.799 align:start position:0%
be a resource to acknowledge that this
 
04:39:15.051 --> 04:39:15.061 align:start position:0%
should not be a conversation in
 
04:39:18.109 --> 04:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities and that
 
04:39:18.119 --> 04:39:19.010 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities and that
um

04:39:19.010 --> 04:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:21.470 --> 04:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
I was sitting here thinking as I do
 
04:39:24.230 --> 04:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
spontaneously every day that the
 
04:39:27.051 --> 04:39:27.061 align:start position:0%
question of adequate amount versus
 
04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
saying I'm going to give you 20 of these
 
04:39:33.170 --> 04:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
types of products if you give 20 of
 
04:39:35.570 --> 04:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
these types of products at a you know
 
04:39:37.610 --> 04:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
systematic period of time in a month
 
04:39:41.208 --> 04:39:41.218 align:start position:0%
you're not dealing with someone who you
 
04:39:42.170 --> 04:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
know there's always going to be someone
 
04:39:44.090 --> 04:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
who does harm right I mean that's what
 
04:39:45.590 --> 04:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
we see across every profession in the
 
04:39:46.730 --> 04:39:46.740 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire whether you're a
 
04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
teacher a counselor or doctor wherever
 
04:39:50.990 --> 04:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
you are I was thinking about the term
 
04:39:52.490 --> 04:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
adequacy and really putting a lot of
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
thought to it you can have a person say
 
04:39:55.970 --> 04:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
well you have three today you can come
 
04:39:56.990 --> 04:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
back and I'll give you three tomorrow
 
04:39:59.750 --> 04:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
you can have four today you have one
 
04:39:59.760 --> 04:40:01.250 align:start position:0%
you can have four today you have one
today

04:40:01.250 --> 04:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:40:02.990 --> 04:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
um I think we're all just trying to make
 
04:40:05.448 --> 04:40:05.458 align:start position:0%
sure that this conversation and our law
 
04:40:08.810 --> 04:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
has a passes are reasonableness test and
 
04:40:11.090 --> 04:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
and tries to make sure the person that's
 
04:40:12.288 --> 04:40:12.298 align:start position:0%
going to do harm
 
04:40:14.448 --> 04:40:14.458 align:start position:0%
doesn't do harm in the best way that we
 
04:40:16.610 --> 04:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
can handle it for women in these
 
04:40:17.810 --> 04:40:17.820 align:start position:0%
situations in our correctional
 
04:40:19.490 --> 04:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
facilities and I appreciate you all for
 
04:40:23.448 --> 04:40:23.458 align:start position:0%
thinking about this topic in a way that
 
04:40:25.070 --> 04:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have anticipated spending so
 
04:40:27.170 --> 04:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
much time on but ultimately we're a
 
04:40:29.990 --> 04:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
resource for you we want to be that and
 
04:40:31.788 --> 04:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
we would appreciate the definition
 
04:40:33.948 --> 04:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
remaining the same the correction that I
 
04:40:36.770 --> 04:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
pointed out and the specific inclusion
 
04:40:38.630 --> 04:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
of Youth uh youth women who are
 
04:40:40.850 --> 04:40:40.860 align:start position:0%
menstruating in our state with that and
 
04:40:42.650 --> 04:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
certainly Avail myself to any questions
 
04:40:48.770 --> 04:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:50.448 --> 04:40:50.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:40:51.708 --> 04:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
commissioner I just wanted to clarify
 
04:40:53.930 --> 04:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
because I've been taking notes since our
 
04:40:57.948 --> 04:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
whole conversation so 622 37a
 
04:41:00.350 --> 04:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
you would like the verbiage to say the
 
04:41:02.510 --> 04:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
warden or superintendent of each is that
 
04:41:03.890 --> 04:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
the words that you said representative
 
04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for that it's Warden or
 
04:41:07.430 --> 04:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
director director in state corrections
 
04:41:09.288 --> 04:41:09.298 align:start position:0%
we do not have superintendents thank you
 
04:41:11.868 --> 04:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
04:41:14.990 --> 04:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
and I just have one quick question
 
04:41:15.000 --> 04:41:16.490 align:start position:0%
and I just have one quick question
um

04:41:16.490 --> 04:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:19.128 --> 04:41:19.138 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that you've examined it but
 
04:41:23.030 --> 04:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
just for for me how is 20 adequate are
 
04:41:24.890 --> 04:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
we or is that generally an adequate
 
04:41:28.850 --> 04:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
amount that the key important part here
 
04:41:31.070 --> 04:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
is the second following sentence that
 
04:41:32.810 --> 04:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
we're giving out a minimum a combination
 
04:41:35.090 --> 04:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
of 20 items and that second sentence
 
04:41:36.890 --> 04:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
that says an individual May request
 
04:41:39.110 --> 04:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
additional products
 
04:41:41.810 --> 04:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
mostly based on their their person at no
 
04:41:44.690 --> 04:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
cost that's important
 
04:41:47.330 --> 04:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
um that's critical they mean something
 
04:41:49.910 --> 04:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
together they don't mean something apart
 
04:41:52.250 --> 04:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
and so whichever you decide the approach
 
04:41:53.510 --> 04:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
has to say
 
04:41:55.670 --> 04:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
we are reasonable we know you may need
 
04:41:58.310 --> 04:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
more I will add at the state level I
 
04:42:00.110 --> 04:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
don't know what the county level we give
 
04:42:02.448 --> 04:42:02.458 align:start position:0%
these at no cost and in our commissary
 
04:42:06.470 --> 04:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
you can choose to buy more right we just
 
04:42:07.730 --> 04:42:07.740 align:start position:0%
don't want this to be a conversation
 
04:42:08.868 --> 04:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
when people are trying to seek
 
04:42:08.878 --> 04:42:10.490 align:start position:0%
when people are trying to seek
rehabilitation

04:42:10.490 --> 04:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation
 
04:42:12.110 --> 04:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
would it not
 
04:42:13.850 --> 04:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
and I understand what you're saying
 
04:42:16.610 --> 04:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
where it says um an individual May
 
04:42:16.620 --> 04:42:18.050 align:start position:0%
where it says um an individual May
request

04:42:18.050 --> 04:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
request
 
04:42:20.448 --> 04:42:20.458 align:start position:0%
um but oftentimes we know that when we
 
04:42:22.910 --> 04:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
request things we are told no
 
04:42:24.530 --> 04:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
um would it not be better to say shall
 
04:42:27.708 --> 04:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
be supplied at their request versus the
 
04:42:32.030 --> 04:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:33.770 --> 04:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
04:42:35.208 --> 04:42:35.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:42:37.190 --> 04:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner um just I just wanted to
 
04:42:39.350 --> 04:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
ask um and I don't know if you can
 
04:42:41.868 --> 04:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
answer this for the county facilities
 
04:42:45.830 --> 04:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
um but the if we're dispensing 20
 
04:42:48.530 --> 04:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
whether pads tampons whatever
 
04:42:50.690 --> 04:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
um are the inmates allowed to keep those
 
04:42:53.150 --> 04:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
in their cell all 20 does would that
 
04:42:55.190 --> 04:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
happen both in the state and County
 
04:42:58.128 --> 04:42:58.138 align:start position:0%
facilities I can speak to the the State
 
04:42:59.330 --> 04:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections that's you
 
04:43:00.830 --> 04:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
keep them in yourself okay I couldn't
 
04:43:02.868 --> 04:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
speak to the county I could assume for
 
04:43:04.550 --> 04:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
the county but I can tell you in state
 
04:43:06.230 --> 04:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
corrections stay in your room
 
04:43:08.448 --> 04:43:08.458 align:start position:0%
great travel with one on your person if
 
04:43:10.310 --> 04:43:10.320 align:start position:0%

yeah that was I just was thinking about
 
04:43:13.550 --> 04:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
the timeliness I mean it's good to great
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
that we've given 20 but if they don't
 
04:43:16.430 --> 04:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
have access to them so thank you thank
 
04:43:16.440 --> 04:43:19.610 align:start position:0%
have access to them so thank you thank

04:43:19.610 --> 04:43:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:21.110 --> 04:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you Mr
 
04:43:22.850 --> 04:43:22.860 align:start position:0%
chairman representative Murphy touched
 
04:43:25.670 --> 04:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
on my question but when you what so you
 
04:43:27.530 --> 04:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
get 20. is that
 
04:43:29.930 --> 04:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
20 at the beginning of the month or I
 
04:43:31.010 --> 04:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
was a little bit confused by something
 
04:43:33.050 --> 04:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
you said or do you get doled out that
 
04:43:34.788 --> 04:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
20. representative wheeler I appreciate
 
04:43:36.288 --> 04:43:36.298 align:start position:0%
the question I didn't actually say those
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
things we give them in a steady supply
 
04:43:41.750 --> 04:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
to the to the person in need
 
04:43:45.350 --> 04:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
um we have a a process but again we have
 
04:43:48.590 --> 04:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
also a total property policy which is a
 
04:43:50.448 --> 04:43:50.458 align:start position:0%
a larger conversation for comparative
 
04:43:53.570 --> 04:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
and a person can have in their room a
 
04:43:56.090 --> 04:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
certain amount of property so that point
 
04:43:59.090 --> 04:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
of not having so much excess of this
 
04:44:01.070 --> 04:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
product but there's also rules and
 
04:44:02.628 --> 04:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
regulations around excess of other
 
04:44:05.390 --> 04:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
products too not to be a hazard
 
04:44:08.330 --> 04:44:08.340 align:start position:0%
um so on a regular basis even if it was
 
04:44:10.368 --> 04:44:10.378 align:start position:0%
daily we have a system that allows us to
 
04:44:12.948 --> 04:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
respond but people are not at a point
 
04:44:14.628 --> 04:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
where they only have 20 products in
 
04:44:16.850 --> 04:44:16.860 align:start position:0%
their room and then on you know day 21
 
04:44:19.128 --> 04:44:19.138 align:start position:0%
they don't have any it's a it's a
 
04:44:21.230 --> 04:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
rolling availability just says you it's
 
04:44:23.510 --> 04:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
as normative in our Correctional
 
04:44:25.310 --> 04:44:25.320 align:start position:0%

05:13:11.690 --> 05:13:11.700 align:start position:0%
to master canine handlers cut a roof
 
05:13:14.208 --> 05:13:14.218 align:start position:0%
a hole in the roof of the house to
 
05:13:21.050 --> 05:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:23.448 --> 05:13:23.458 align:start position:0%
under Massachusetts law at the time
 
05:13:25.788 --> 05:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
emergency medical care and
 
05:13:28.010 --> 05:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
transportation to a veterinary hospital
 
05:13:31.490 --> 05:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
for Nero was not permitted the unit
 
05:13:35.150 --> 05:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
Commander at the scene made quote one of
 
05:13:36.948 --> 05:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
the most decisions of difficult
 
05:13:39.470 --> 05:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
decisions of his life end quote and
 
05:13:42.050 --> 05:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
placed Nero into his Cruiser
 
05:13:44.690 --> 05:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
an emergency medicine physician who was
 
05:13:47.270 --> 05:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
also at the scene went into the cruiser
 
05:13:50.270 --> 05:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
and together they rushed Nero to a
 
05:13:51.948 --> 05:13:51.958 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Hospital
 
05:13:55.368 --> 05:13:55.378 align:start position:0%
by this time Nero was gasping for air
 
05:13:58.128 --> 05:13:58.138 align:start position:0%
The Physician intubated Nero with a
 
05:14:00.530 --> 05:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
drinking straw which was the only tool
 
05:14:02.448 --> 05:14:02.458 align:start position:0%
that he had available to him in the
 
05:14:06.470 --> 05:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
cruiser to that enabled Nero to breathe
 
05:14:08.510 --> 05:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
the prolonged delay and access to
 
05:14:11.330 --> 05:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
treatment seriously jeopardized Nero's
 
05:14:13.970 --> 05:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
chance of survival and inflicted hours
 
05:14:16.070 --> 05:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
of suffering for the dog
 
05:14:18.050 --> 05:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
in fact you wouldn't have those two
 
05:14:21.410 --> 05:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
recovery pictures of Nero today had that
 
05:14:23.990 --> 05:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
unit Commander not enabled Nero to be
 
05:14:26.750 --> 05:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
transported in a cruiser Nero would have
 
05:14:26.760 --> 05:14:28.250 align:start position:0%
transported in a cruiser Nero would have
died

05:14:28.250 --> 05:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
died
 
05:14:30.650 --> 05:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
Nero underwent surgery that night and
 
05:14:32.570 --> 05:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
spent weeks with canine officers
 
05:14:35.208 --> 05:14:35.218 align:start position:0%
sleeping with Nero in his cage Around
 
05:14:36.410 --> 05:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
the Clock
 
05:14:40.368 --> 05:14:40.378 align:start position:0%
Nero was a despondent until Sean's Widow
 
05:14:43.430 --> 05:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
placed one of Sean's shirts under Nero's
 
05:14:46.368 --> 05:14:46.378 align:start position:0%
head for the first time Nero's tale
 
05:14:49.670 --> 05:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
slowly wagged when he smelled Sean's
 
05:14:49.680 --> 05:14:50.690 align:start position:0%
slowly wagged when he smelled Sean's
scent

05:14:50.690 --> 05:14:50.700 align:start position:0%
scent
 
05:14:52.788 --> 05:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
when Nero was released from the hospital
 
05:14:55.368 --> 05:14:55.378 align:start position:0%
one of the first things Nero did was
 
05:14:58.730 --> 05:14:58.740 align:start position:0%
climb into his Cruiser and licked the
 
05:15:02.330 --> 05:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
headrest where Sean sent remained these
 
05:15:04.788 --> 05:15:04.798 align:start position:0%
are illustrations of the bond that
 
05:15:08.270 --> 05:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
exists between a canine and its Handler
 
05:15:10.850 --> 05:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
at the time Nero was fairly new in his
 
05:15:12.830 --> 05:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
career as a patrol drug but
 
05:15:15.830 --> 05:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the extent of his injuries
 
05:15:17.448 --> 05:15:17.458 align:start position:0%
combined with the traumatic
 
05:15:20.330 --> 05:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
circumstances forced Nero into early
 
05:15:20.340 --> 05:15:22.010 align:start position:0%
circumstances forced Nero into early
retirement

05:15:22.010 --> 05:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
05:15:24.770 --> 05:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
delays in care of this nature combined
 
05:15:27.530 --> 05:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
with a possibly unnecessary retirement
 
05:15:30.288 --> 05:15:30.298 align:start position:0%
do not need to be repeated for any
 
05:15:33.890 --> 05:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
canine in any law enforcement agency
 
05:15:36.050 --> 05:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
the events that occurred came at a
 
05:15:37.850 --> 05:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
significant cost to the Yarmouth Police
 
05:15:40.610 --> 05:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
Department the acquisition of a canine
 
05:15:43.490 --> 05:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
animal the extensive initial and ongoing
 
05:15:46.310 --> 05:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
training for both the canine and its
 
05:15:48.890 --> 05:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
Handler in addition to the Daily care
 
05:15:51.288 --> 05:15:51.298 align:start position:0%
and support requires substantial
 
05:15:54.708 --> 05:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
monetary Investments these Investments
 
05:15:57.230 --> 05:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
are completely lost when a wounded
 
05:16:00.350 --> 05:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
canine cannot receive timely care that
 
05:16:02.810 --> 05:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
could result in recovery and a return to
 
05:16:02.820 --> 05:16:04.070 align:start position:0%
could result in recovery and a return to
duty

05:16:04.070 --> 05:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
duty
 
05:16:06.530 --> 05:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
the emergency care and transportation of
 
05:16:08.570 --> 05:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
a canine that's wounded in the line of
 
05:16:12.470 --> 05:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
duty are cost savings measures
 
05:16:14.350 --> 05:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
since its passage in Massachusetts
 
05:16:17.810 --> 05:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
Nero's law has been invoked twice once
 
05:16:20.690 --> 05:16:20.700 align:start position:0%
in July and most recently in December
 
05:16:24.288 --> 05:16:24.298 align:start position:0%
there is a need for a law of this nature
 
05:16:26.510 --> 05:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts teaching and training
 
05:16:29.448 --> 05:16:29.458 align:start position:0%
is ongoing for Nero's law across our
 
05:16:32.448 --> 05:16:32.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:36.830 --> 05:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
canines live and work and die for their
 
05:16:40.368 --> 05:16:40.378 align:start position:0%
handlers as we saw in the case of the
 
05:16:44.628 --> 05:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
canine kit when he dove into uh
 
05:16:46.730 --> 05:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
he saw what officers did not see
 
05:16:50.170 --> 05:16:50.180 align:start position:0%
initially and Dove right into the
 
05:16:55.010 --> 05:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
gunfire and save three officers lives
 
05:16:59.930 --> 05:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:03.250 --> 05:17:03.260 align:start position:0%
they work 24 7
 
05:17:06.170 --> 05:17:06.180 align:start position:0%
365 days a year
 
05:17:08.270 --> 05:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
and if the officer has a family the
 
05:17:11.868 --> 05:17:11.878 align:start position:0%
canine becomes a member of that family
 
05:17:14.390 --> 05:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
so I ask you
 
05:17:17.030 --> 05:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
which one of you would let a beloved
 
05:17:18.830 --> 05:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
family member
 
05:17:20.868 --> 05:17:20.878 align:start position:0%
who serves the public
 
05:17:23.510 --> 05:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
suffer and be close to death
 
05:17:25.610 --> 05:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
and not rush
 
05:17:29.628 --> 05:17:29.638 align:start position:0%
to acquire immediate emergency
 
05:17:32.270 --> 05:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
medical help
 
05:17:34.670 --> 05:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
there are some things that have happened
 
05:17:37.490 --> 05:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
that we can't change
 
05:17:40.010 --> 05:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
but this lies something we can change
 
05:17:43.490 --> 05:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
and we have changed Massachusetts Rhode
 
05:17:46.850 --> 05:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
Island Maine Connecticut's effort is
 
05:17:46.860 --> 05:17:48.230 align:start position:0%
Island Maine Connecticut's effort is
underway

05:17:48.230 --> 05:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
underway
 
05:17:50.448 --> 05:17:50.458 align:start position:0%
across the country we see rapidly
 
05:17:52.930 --> 05:17:52.940 align:start position:0%
growing interest among First Responders
 
05:17:55.730 --> 05:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
veterinarians in the general public for
 
05:17:58.970 --> 05:17:58.980 align:start position:0%
needed legislation like Max's law
 
05:18:02.570 --> 05:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
in fact 46 percent of all states have
 
05:18:05.030 --> 05:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
either passed a version of Max's law or
 
05:18:07.490 --> 05:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
have similar efforts underway
 
05:18:10.850 --> 05:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
Colorado led the way
 
05:18:13.550 --> 05:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
we hope that New Hampshire will follow
 
05:18:16.788 --> 05:18:16.798 align:start position:0%
suit with Max's law to support canines
 
05:18:20.390 --> 05:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
their handlers law enforcement and the
 
05:18:20.400 --> 05:18:21.830 align:start position:0%
their handlers law enforcement and the
public

05:18:21.830 --> 05:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:18:25.490 --> 05:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
in the posthumous crato of our son Sean
 
05:18:27.650 --> 05:18:27.660 align:start position:0%

I was Sean's
boss

05:19:29.750 --> 05:19:29.760 align:start position:0%

favorable report
 
05:19:48.530 --> 05:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
on your bill known as Max's law
 
05:19:51.410 --> 05:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
it has very special meaning to me
 
05:19:55.910 --> 05:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:58.970 --> 05:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
uh Massachusetts passed it last year
 
05:20:02.990 --> 05:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
on the anniversary of Sean's murder
 
05:20:04.430 --> 05:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell you a little bit of the
 
05:20:07.610 --> 05:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
story you heard from Mrs Gannon and Mr
 
05:20:10.610 --> 05:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
Gannon I mean those are the parents of a
 
05:20:12.650 --> 05:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
murdered police officer
 
05:20:16.970 --> 05:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:19.368 --> 05:20:19.378 align:start position:0%
it was so Nero's law
 
05:20:22.550 --> 05:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
is inspired out of tragic events that
 
05:20:26.208 --> 05:20:26.218 align:start position:0%
took place on April 12th 2018. back on
 
05:20:28.670 --> 05:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
that day I was the Deputy Chief of
 
05:20:28.680 --> 05:20:29.690 align:start position:0%
that day I was the Deputy Chief of
Police

05:20:29.690 --> 05:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
Police
 
05:20:32.628 --> 05:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
for the Yarmouth Police Department
 
05:20:34.910 --> 05:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
we received information that a violent
 
05:20:36.170 --> 05:20:36.180 align:start position:0%
career Criminal
 
05:20:40.670 --> 05:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
with 125 prior charges
 
05:20:42.770 --> 05:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
was at a house
 
05:20:46.128 --> 05:20:46.138 align:start position:0%
he was wanted on outstanding warrants
 
05:20:48.288 --> 05:20:48.298 align:start position:0%
we had information that he was armed
 
05:20:51.050 --> 05:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
illegally and we knew him we knew he was
 
05:20:51.060 --> 05:20:52.970 align:start position:0%
illegally and we knew him we knew he was
dangerous

05:20:52.970 --> 05:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
05:20:59.270 --> 05:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:02.570 --> 05:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
and I heard them screaming on the radio
 
05:21:12.110 --> 05:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:14.690 --> 05:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
so I raced as fast as I could to the
 
05:21:14.700 --> 05:21:16.310 align:start position:0%
so I raced as fast as I could to the
scene

05:21:16.310 --> 05:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
scene
 
05:21:19.850 --> 05:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
I learned that canine Sergeant Sean
 
05:21:25.490 --> 05:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:29.150 --> 05:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:32.390 --> 05:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
and then I learned through my radio that
 
05:21:33.590 --> 05:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
he had died
 
05:21:36.650 --> 05:21:36.660 align:start position:0%
at the hospital despite everyone doing
 
05:21:40.430 --> 05:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
their best and looking back he probably
 
05:21:42.170 --> 05:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
died at the house
 
05:21:45.230 --> 05:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
but they rescued him and did everything
 
05:21:48.110 --> 05:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
they could to save him
 
05:21:50.628 --> 05:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
but meanwhile the shooter was in the
 
05:21:50.638 --> 05:21:53.150 align:start position:0%
but meanwhile the shooter was in the
house

05:21:53.150 --> 05:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:55.970 --> 05:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
and so was Nero
 
05:21:58.128 --> 05:21:58.138 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:22:00.830 --> 05:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
the SWAT team came and
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
help came from everywhere and I was
 
05:22:05.930 --> 05:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
right there the whole time
 
05:22:08.030 --> 05:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
from three o'clock in the afternoon till
 
05:22:13.868 --> 05:22:13.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:17.690 --> 05:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
and Mrs Gannon talked about it
 
05:22:23.628 --> 05:22:23.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:26.090 --> 05:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
we knew that he had murdered my officer
 
05:22:28.010 --> 05:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
my brother
 
05:22:32.170 --> 05:22:32.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:34.610 --> 05:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
and he walked out of that building with
 
05:22:38.628 --> 05:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:40.910 --> 05:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'll never forget that sight and that
 
05:22:43.070 --> 05:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
feeling and
 
05:22:48.170 --> 05:22:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:51.050 --> 05:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
and but the mission wasn't done we
 
05:22:53.448 --> 05:22:53.458 align:start position:0%
needed to find narrow
 
05:22:55.190 --> 05:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
and we needed to make sure there was no
 
05:23:00.770 --> 05:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:02.690 --> 05:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
so the SWAT team went in and they do
 
05:23:04.970 --> 05:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
what they do
 
05:23:07.250 --> 05:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
but I'll never forget the sight of them
 
05:23:10.190 --> 05:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
carrying out Nero you know he was still
 
05:23:10.200 --> 05:23:16.010 align:start position:0%
carrying out Nero you know he was still
alive

05:23:16.010 --> 05:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:16.020 --> 05:23:23.868 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:23:23.868 --> 05:23:23.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:26.448 --> 05:23:26.458 align:start position:0%
you know gasping for for air he was
 
05:23:28.970 --> 05:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
bleeding to death choking to death and
 
05:23:28.980 --> 05:23:30.110 align:start position:0%
bleeding to death choking to death and
nobody

05:23:30.110 --> 05:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
nobody
 
05:23:33.110 --> 05:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
could legally help him
 
05:23:35.750 --> 05:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
all the EMTs all the paramedics all the
 
05:23:38.690 --> 05:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
ambulances sitting there
 
05:23:41.570 --> 05:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
um the hands were tied
 
05:23:41.580 --> 05:23:43.010 align:start position:0%
um the hands were tied
so

05:23:43.010 --> 05:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:23:46.910 --> 05:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
the police took over as as mentioned a
 
05:23:49.610 --> 05:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
doctor from the SWAT team jumped in back
 
05:23:51.110 --> 05:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
of a cruiser
 
05:23:54.350 --> 05:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
Peter McClellan um
 
05:23:56.750 --> 05:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
a retired Yarmouth officer who was
 
05:23:58.310 --> 05:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
called to the scene
 
05:24:02.150 --> 05:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
because we knew if Nero was alive
 
05:24:05.628 --> 05:24:05.638 align:start position:0%
somebody would have to handle him
 
05:24:07.730 --> 05:24:07.740 align:start position:0%
and Peter was
 
05:24:09.770 --> 05:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
a canine Handler
 
05:24:12.470 --> 05:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
he raised Nero as a puppy
 
05:24:22.190 --> 05:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:22.200 --> 05:24:23.650 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:24:23.650 --> 05:24:23.660 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:24:26.990 --> 05:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
so a Barnesville police officer drove a
 
05:24:27.000 --> 05:24:27.948 align:start position:0%
so a Barnesville police officer drove a
cruiser

05:24:27.948 --> 05:24:27.958 align:start position:0%
cruiser
 
05:24:30.770 --> 05:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
a doctor sat in the back
 
05:24:33.350 --> 05:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
Nero was on Peter's lap
 
05:24:35.208 --> 05:24:35.218 align:start position:0%
and they did the best they could to keep
 
05:24:37.070 --> 05:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
him alive
 
05:24:39.288 --> 05:24:39.298 align:start position:0%
and he was transported to the Veterinary
 
05:24:39.298 --> 05:24:42.470 align:start position:0%
and he was transported to the Veterinary
Hospital

05:24:42.470 --> 05:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:46.490 --> 05:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:49.430 --> 05:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
and for a week
 
05:24:53.030 --> 05:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
police officers never left Nero
 
05:24:55.910 --> 05:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
Peter McClellan slept in the cage with
 
05:24:57.890 --> 05:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
him at the hospital
 
05:25:02.750 --> 05:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:06.170 --> 05:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
and I was there when when that picture
 
05:25:08.750 --> 05:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
was taken that you may have
 
05:25:12.530 --> 05:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
we knew that Nero was coming out
 
05:25:14.750 --> 05:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
we ordered Sean's Cruiser to be brought
 
05:25:18.288 --> 05:25:18.298 align:start position:0%
to the scene Sean's Cruiser
 
05:25:20.628 --> 05:25:20.638 align:start position:0%
and when Nero came out I was standing
 
05:25:22.310 --> 05:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
right there
 
05:25:24.650 --> 05:25:24.660 align:start position:0%
and he was so skinny
 
05:25:28.970 --> 05:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
he's covered in scars stitches
 
05:25:32.330 --> 05:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
and I saw his eyes you know staring at
 
05:25:34.670 --> 05:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
Sean's Cruiser and he was looking for
 
05:25:34.680 --> 05:25:37.250 align:start position:0%
Sean's Cruiser and he was looking for
Sean

05:25:37.250 --> 05:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:40.128 --> 05:25:40.138 align:start position:0%
and then I open the back door where the
 
05:25:43.850 --> 05:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
Nero goes and he jumped right in
 
05:25:49.368 --> 05:25:49.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:49.378 --> 05:25:53.448 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:25:53.448 --> 05:25:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:57.050 --> 05:25:57.060 align:start position:0%
after we laid Sean to rest and after I
 
05:26:00.410 --> 05:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
handed the folded flag to Mrs Gannon
 
05:26:05.208 --> 05:26:05.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:07.310 --> 05:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
we just kept working and doing what we
 
05:26:10.128 --> 05:26:10.138 align:start position:0%
could to to heal our officers and honors
 
05:26:10.138 --> 05:26:12.050 align:start position:0%
could to to heal our officers and honors
on

05:26:12.050 --> 05:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:26:17.150 --> 05:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:19.550 --> 05:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
with the help of veterinarians and and
 
05:26:19.560 --> 05:26:20.930 align:start position:0%
with the help of veterinarians and and
uh

05:26:20.930 --> 05:26:20.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:26:23.270 --> 05:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
people and police officers and and rep
 
05:26:25.430 --> 05:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
Crocker was the the representative at
 
05:26:28.730 --> 05:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
the time I was a police officer
 
05:26:33.650 --> 05:26:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:37.010 --> 05:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
so that was a message to me after 40
 
05:26:39.470 --> 05:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
Years of serving
 
05:26:39.480 --> 05:26:40.550 align:start position:0%
Years of serving
um

05:26:40.550 --> 05:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:43.190 --> 05:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
I needed to retire from the job that I
 
05:26:46.250 --> 05:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
loved and run for office
 
05:26:49.430 --> 05:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
to do something I've never done
 
05:26:52.190 --> 05:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
probably a lot like you you know we
 
05:26:54.948 --> 05:26:54.958 align:start position:0%
we run for office to to Serve and
 
05:26:57.890 --> 05:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
Protect and to help and for me it was to
 
05:27:00.650 --> 05:27:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:06.350 --> 05:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:09.110 --> 05:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's not easy to make a law
 
05:27:12.368 --> 05:27:12.378 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing as a no-brainer
 
05:27:15.470 --> 05:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
it failed the first time and then High
 
05:27:16.788 --> 05:27:16.798 align:start position:0%
filed it
 
05:27:19.430 --> 05:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
and honestly I never worked so hard to
 
05:27:21.288 --> 05:27:21.298 align:start position:0%
to bring people together to get
 
05:27:21.298 --> 05:27:23.628 align:start position:0%
to bring people together to get
co-sponsors

05:27:23.628 --> 05:27:23.638 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors
 
05:27:26.208 --> 05:27:26.218 align:start position:0%
tell the story of Sean just kind of like
 
05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:32.750 --> 05:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:27:36.070 --> 05:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
for me you know as a rookie
 
05:27:39.230 --> 05:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative in Massachusetts
 
05:27:42.230 --> 05:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
we got it done in 10 months
 
05:27:44.750 --> 05:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
and I thank Governor Baker and all my
 
05:27:47.330 --> 05:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
colleagues for coming together to do the
 
05:27:49.310 --> 05:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
right thing
 
05:27:51.050 --> 05:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
and then there was a matter of well
 
05:27:53.930 --> 05:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
where do we do the signing of this bill
 
05:27:57.770 --> 05:27:57.780 align:start position:0%
that took so long and so much blood
 
05:28:01.010 --> 05:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
and uh I asked Governor Baker if he
 
05:28:02.090 --> 05:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
would come to Yarmouth police
 
05:28:02.100 --> 05:28:03.650 align:start position:0%
would come to Yarmouth police
headquarters

05:28:03.650 --> 05:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
headquarters
 
05:28:08.030 --> 05:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
and sign it on the day of the tragedy
 
05:28:10.310 --> 05:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
and he said Steve I would be honored but
 
05:28:13.310 --> 05:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
is that okay with the ganons
 
05:28:15.770 --> 05:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
and they said yes
 
05:28:19.730 --> 05:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
so if you can just picture uh four years
 
05:28:21.890 --> 05:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
to the day
 
05:28:23.868 --> 05:28:23.878 align:start position:0%
Governor Baker lieutenant governor
 
05:28:26.690 --> 05:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
Polito all my colleagues
 
05:28:29.930 --> 05:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
Mrs Gannon missed again and
 
05:28:31.850 --> 05:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
Sean's Widow
 
05:28:36.110 --> 05:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
and Nero and about 50 police dogs and
 
05:28:38.690 --> 05:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
everybody was there
 
05:28:41.030 --> 05:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
and not at Yarmouth Police Headquarters
 
05:28:43.730 --> 05:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
but behind it
 
05:28:48.410 --> 05:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:51.410 --> 05:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
about five years ago and he said Deputy
 
05:28:53.690 --> 05:28:53.700 align:start position:0%
what if we cleared these Woods
 
05:28:55.970 --> 05:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
and we made a canine training center
 
05:28:58.190 --> 05:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
because we should be able to train our
 
05:29:01.070 --> 05:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:04.788 --> 05:29:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:07.970 --> 05:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
so we cleared those woods and we built a
 
05:29:11.150 --> 05:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
one million dollar Training Center
 
05:29:14.690 --> 05:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
it's called the canine sergeant Sean M
 
05:29:18.650 --> 05:29:18.660 align:start position:0%
Gannon police canine Center
 
05:29:21.830 --> 05:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
and that is where the bill was signed in
 
05:29:23.030 --> 05:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
that building
 
05:29:26.330 --> 05:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:28.788 --> 05:29:28.798 align:start position:0%
it's doing the right thing

05:29:56.868 --> 05:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
because the bill wasn't signed yet
 
05:29:59.930 --> 05:29:59.940 align:start position:0%

D'Alessandro had referenced
 
05:32:35.570 --> 05:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
if I could direct your attention to line
 
05:32:37.490 --> 05:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
number 20.
 
05:32:39.590 --> 05:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
the last two words in that sentence
 
05:32:41.750 --> 05:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
ambulance services we'd like to strike
 
05:32:43.550 --> 05:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
those and replace them with the word
 
05:32:43.560 --> 05:32:44.930 align:start position:0%

I've had the distinct opportunity to
 
05:33:30.470 --> 05:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
work with these animals that are beyond
 
05:33:32.570 --> 05:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
amazing in their abilities
 
05:33:34.128 --> 05:33:34.138 align:start position:0%
all around New Hampshire we have
 
05:33:36.650 --> 05:33:36.660 align:start position:0%
operational canines demonstrating their
 
05:33:39.590 --> 05:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
capabilities from our detection dogs who
 
05:33:39.600 --> 05:33:41.090 align:start position:0%
capabilities from our detection dogs who
can

05:33:41.090 --> 05:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:33:43.430 --> 05:33:43.440 align:start position:0%

Narcotics explosives or accelerants
 
05:33:48.410 --> 05:33:48.420 align:start position:0%
to our tracking dogs who are asked to
 
05:33:49.850 --> 05:33:49.860 align:start position:0%
find Alzheimer's patients or small
 
05:33:51.288 --> 05:33:51.298 align:start position:0%
children who have wandered sometimes
 
05:33:53.570 --> 05:33:53.580 align:start position:0%

criminals to even our comfort dogs who
 
05:34:03.050 --> 05:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
are there for people in their time of
 
05:34:05.150 --> 05:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
need in a way that humans simply cannot
 
05:34:05.160 --> 05:34:06.830 align:start position:0%
need in a way that humans simply cannot
be

05:34:06.830 --> 05:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:34:08.810 --> 05:34:08.820 align:start position:0%

05:34:10.320 --> 05:34:11.930 align:start position:0%
have a picture of my dog also named
Frankie

05:34:11.930 --> 05:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
Frankie
 
05:34:13.550 --> 05:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
this Senate bill has a very different
 
05:34:16.310 --> 05:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
meaning for me as opposed to that of
 
05:34:18.708 --> 05:34:18.718 align:start position:0%
maybe a Department's Administration who
 
05:34:20.330 --> 05:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
may be looking at the financial aspect
 
05:34:22.190 --> 05:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
of losing a dog
 
05:34:24.590 --> 05:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
or societies want to protect all dogs
 
05:34:26.628 --> 05:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
because we love them
 
05:34:29.810 --> 05:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
as a patrolman and a member of the SWAT
 
05:34:31.310 --> 05:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
team I'm frequently called on sometimes
 
05:34:32.930 --> 05:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the night
 
05:34:34.310 --> 05:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
to respond to the most dangerous
 
05:34:37.788 --> 05:34:37.798 align:start position:0%
situations and once on scene I asked
 
05:34:39.530 --> 05:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
Frankie to quite literally become the
 
05:34:41.390 --> 05:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
tip of the spear
 
05:34:43.310 --> 05:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
I asked him to go first into the unknown
 
05:34:45.410 --> 05:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
while as humans are 40 plus feet behind
 
05:34:47.448 --> 05:34:47.458 align:start position:0%
them sometimes I even ask Frankie to go
 
05:34:49.190 --> 05:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
in alone while I wait safely out of
 
05:34:49.200 --> 05:34:50.690 align:start position:0%
in alone while I wait safely out of
sight

05:34:50.690 --> 05:34:50.700 align:start position:0%
sight
 
05:34:53.570 --> 05:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
and without question fearlessly Frankie
 
05:34:55.090 --> 05:34:55.100 align:start position:0%
will head off into the dark unknown
 
05:34:57.590 --> 05:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
because I asked him to
 
05:34:59.690 --> 05:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
and he'll do this so that he can first
 
05:35:01.368 --> 05:35:01.378 align:start position:0%
encounter whatever danger maybe hiding
 
05:35:03.288 --> 05:35:03.298 align:start position:0%
in a corner or behind a door or lurking
 
05:35:05.330 --> 05:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
in the shadows so that he can take the
 
05:35:06.890 --> 05:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
bullet or the knife or the punch or the
 
05:35:09.948 --> 05:35:09.958 align:start position:0%
kick so that his humans don't have to
 
05:35:12.470 --> 05:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
and this bill will be our way of showing
 
05:35:14.448 --> 05:35:14.458 align:start position:0%
these brave animals that we appreciate
 
05:35:16.128 --> 05:35:16.138 align:start position:0%
their efforts to keep us safe and that
 
05:35:17.510 --> 05:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
we're willing to do
 
05:35:19.128 --> 05:35:19.138 align:start position:0%
whatever we can to help them in their
 
05:35:20.390 --> 05:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
time and need
 
05:35:23.208 --> 05:35:23.218 align:start position:0%
so I would ask you all that you find
 
05:35:25.128 --> 05:35:25.138 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 268
 
05:35:26.990 --> 05:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and thanks so much for
 
05:35:28.730 --> 05:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
your consideration I I can also answer
 
05:35:30.770 --> 05:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have from the
 
05:35:34.730 --> 05:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:36.550 --> 05:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
05:35:39.470 --> 05:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
what would I miss representative Newman
 
05:35:41.510 --> 05:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
could you just repeat what you said
 
05:35:43.128 --> 05:35:43.138 align:start position:0%
about what the change is in the
 
05:35:45.288 --> 05:35:45.298 align:start position:0%
amendment yes
 
05:35:49.070 --> 05:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
um so line number 20 in the amendment in
 
05:35:50.868 --> 05:35:50.878 align:start position:0%
yes in the in the bill that sits before
 
05:35:53.570 --> 05:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
you uh line number 20
 
05:35:55.128 --> 05:35:55.138 align:start position:0%
um the line reads injured in the course
 
05:35:57.350 --> 05:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
of their official duties and no human
 
05:36:01.368 --> 05:36:01.378 align:start position:0%
needs or needs transport or those last
 
05:36:04.490 --> 05:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
two lines ambulance services we'd like
 
05:36:06.830 --> 05:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
to strike those and replace it with the
 
05:36:10.550 --> 05:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:16.910 --> 05:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:18.770 --> 05:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
just further further clarification
 
05:36:19.850 --> 05:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
because I think we're a little bit
 
05:36:21.230 --> 05:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
confused on this side
 
05:36:22.970 --> 05:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
um so the ambulance services that you're
 
05:36:25.368 --> 05:36:25.378 align:start position:0%
seeing is on line 24 that's what you're
 
05:36:26.750 --> 05:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
05:36:29.990 --> 05:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
hey hello oh okay yeah if the members if
 
05:36:31.430 --> 05:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
the members could just hold off the
 
05:36:33.050 --> 05:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
technical questions we have an amendment
 
05:36:34.970 --> 05:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
in the works that encompasses everything
 
05:36:37.190 --> 05:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
that's being discussed I see that's
 
05:36:40.368 --> 05:36:40.378 align:start position:0%
where our confusion came yeah no problem
 
05:36:42.730 --> 05:36:42.740 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the officer
 
05:36:45.410 --> 05:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
representative side Tech
 
05:36:48.230 --> 05:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh as a matter of Interest how long does
 
05:36:52.010 --> 05:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
it take to train an operational dog
 
05:36:53.628 --> 05:36:53.638 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative say it again
 
05:36:55.788 --> 05:36:55.798 align:start position:0%
how long does it take to train one of
 
05:36:59.510 --> 05:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
these I don't know service animals so
 
05:37:02.628 --> 05:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
um for most departments here in Southern
 
05:37:03.708 --> 05:37:03.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:37:05.868 --> 05:37:05.878 align:start position:0%
we all train with the Boston police
 
05:37:07.910 --> 05:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
canine training group
 
05:37:11.868 --> 05:37:11.878 align:start position:0%
so for a training for a patrol dog we go
 
05:37:14.230 --> 05:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
down to Boston every day for 14 weeks
 
05:37:17.390 --> 05:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
dog and Handler so the certification at
 
05:37:20.030 --> 05:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
the end of that 14 weeks is for the team
 
05:37:22.430 --> 05:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
so if that dog were to go to a different
 
05:37:24.170 --> 05:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
Handler they would have to restart that
 
05:37:24.180 --> 05:37:25.390 align:start position:0%
Handler they would have to restart that
program

05:37:25.390 --> 05:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:37:29.150 --> 05:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
once the 14 weeks is done most many dogs
 
05:37:31.190 --> 05:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
many Patrol dogs here in the state are
 
05:37:32.510 --> 05:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
dual certified
 
05:37:34.310 --> 05:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
so they have a secondary certification
 
05:37:37.128 --> 05:37:37.138 align:start position:0%
so for Frankie canine Frankie he's
 
05:37:38.930 --> 05:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
secondary certification is that of
 
05:37:41.868 --> 05:37:41.878 align:start position:0%
explosive ordinance detection EOD he's a
 
05:37:42.890 --> 05:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
bomb dog
 
05:37:45.590 --> 05:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
so we had to go back down to Boston for
 
05:37:47.890 --> 05:37:47.900 align:start position:0%
a 10-week program
 
05:37:51.170 --> 05:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
once those two certifications are done
 
05:37:53.750 --> 05:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
the dogs will have to pass annual
 
05:37:56.690 --> 05:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
certification recertifications put on by
 
05:38:00.288 --> 05:38:00.298 align:start position:0%
national organizations
 
05:38:02.570 --> 05:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
to keep our status with the Boston
 
05:38:05.090 --> 05:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
police training group we also have to go
 
05:38:07.310 --> 05:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
down to two eight hour training days a
 
05:38:07.320 --> 05:38:08.510 align:start position:0%
down to two eight hour training days a
month

05:38:08.510 --> 05:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
month
 
05:38:10.730 --> 05:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
and that's just formal training that
 
05:38:13.190 --> 05:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't count the daily training that a
 
05:38:15.050 --> 05:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
Handler will put his dog through just to
 
05:38:16.910 --> 05:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
ensure that if they do get the call the
 
05:38:19.190 --> 05:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
dog is is ready
 
05:38:21.830 --> 05:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
all of that training is also documented
 
05:38:25.970 --> 05:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
so the the pages and pages of training
 
05:38:25.980 --> 05:38:27.070 align:start position:0%
so the the pages and pages of training
sheets

05:38:27.070 --> 05:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
sheets
 
05:38:33.650 --> 05:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:39.650 --> 05:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:51.708 --> 05:38:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:54.708 --> 05:38:54.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chair Roy members of the
 
05:38:57.470 --> 05:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Stacy Ober and I am
 
05:38:59.030 --> 05:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
the New England manager of government

we were founded in 1884 where a
 
05:39:05.160 --> 05:39:08.208 align:start position:0%
we were founded in 1884 where a
non-profit

05:39:10.970 --> 05:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
canine club that is widely recognized
 
05:39:13.430 --> 05:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
for canine breeding training and
 
05:39:15.830 --> 05:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
responsible dog ownership we represent
 
05:39:18.490 --> 05:39:18.500 align:start position:0%
more than 5 000 clubs across the country
 
05:39:22.128 --> 05:39:22.138 align:start position:0%
including 13 here in New Hampshire
 
05:39:26.208 --> 05:39:26.218 align:start position:0%
and back in 2021 AKC licensed and
 
05:39:28.550 --> 05:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
sanctioned 150 events in New Hampshire
 
05:39:32.930 --> 05:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
where more than 26 000 dogs participated
 
05:39:36.890 --> 05:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
I'm here in support of Senate bill 268.
 
05:39:40.730 --> 05:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
I want to just acknowledge that AKC
 
05:39:43.610 --> 05:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
educates and supports the breeders of
 
05:39:46.190 --> 05:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
these high quality dogs that are bred
 
05:39:48.708 --> 05:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
for their predictable type their
 
05:39:51.230 --> 05:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
instincts and their temperament to
 
05:39:55.970 --> 05:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:57.708 --> 05:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
um we value the contribution that these
 
05:39:59.330 --> 05:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
working dogs make to National Security
 
05:40:01.550 --> 05:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
and the extraordinary role that these
 
05:40:03.288 --> 05:40:03.298 align:start position:0%
dogs play in protecting the peace and
 
05:40:05.448 --> 05:40:05.458 align:start position:0%
security of individuals communities and
 
05:40:08.690 --> 05:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
nations against threats and we honor the
 
05:40:10.730 --> 05:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
Breeders trainers and handlers of these
 
05:40:10.740 --> 05:40:12.590 align:start position:0%
Breeders trainers and handlers of these
dogs

05:40:12.590 --> 05:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
dogs
 
05:40:15.050 --> 05:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
to ensure Public Safety and National
 
05:40:17.390 --> 05:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
Security we support expanded scientific
 
05:40:21.770 --> 05:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
research and breeders who ensure that
 
05:40:23.330 --> 05:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
sufficient numbers of high quality
 
05:40:26.150 --> 05:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
domestically bred dogs are available and
 
05:40:29.390 --> 05:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
we're asking you to pass Senate 268 so
 
05:40:31.970 --> 05:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
that Specialized Care is provided to
 
05:40:33.890 --> 05:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
assure their well-being
 
05:40:37.550 --> 05:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
I know a lay person may be contemplating
 
05:40:39.708 --> 05:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
uh what would be the difference for
 
05:40:42.948 --> 05:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
instance in emergently transporting a
 
05:40:45.050 --> 05:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
police canine in a cruiser with the
 
05:40:46.788 --> 05:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
lights on versus an ambulance that's
 
05:40:49.310 --> 05:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
able to get there expediently and I just
 
05:40:51.708 --> 05:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to emphasize that our emergency
 
05:40:54.890 --> 05:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
medical personnel have the skills for
 
05:40:58.490 --> 05:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
instance to pack a wound open an airway
 
05:41:02.830 --> 05:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
do certain life-saving skills that
 
05:41:04.850 --> 05:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
another you know a police officer
 
05:41:07.190 --> 05:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily have and that's the
 
05:41:09.890 --> 05:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
benefit of knowing they already have the
 
05:41:13.010 --> 05:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
basic skills to be able to provide life
 
05:41:16.610 --> 05:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
saving treatment while the dog is being
 
05:41:18.948 --> 05:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
emergently transported
 
05:41:22.550 --> 05:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
I also wanted to acknowledge that our
 
05:41:26.868 --> 05:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
affiliate AKC reunite works with our AKC
 
05:41:29.990 --> 05:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
clubs to donate police canines to police
 
05:41:32.270 --> 05:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
departments around the United States
 
05:41:34.910 --> 05:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
many police K-9 units are suffering
 
05:41:36.770 --> 05:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
budget cuts and they're unable to
 
05:41:38.810 --> 05:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
solicit money due to town and
 
05:41:41.570 --> 05:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
municipality codes and so the donations
 
05:41:44.868 --> 05:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
from AKC reunite and the AKC clubs allow
 
05:41:46.970 --> 05:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
the police department's need for a new
 
05:41:50.208 --> 05:41:50.218 align:start position:0%
canine to become a reality a maximum of
 
05:41:52.850 --> 05:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
one Grant per department and a total of
 
05:41:57.948 --> 05:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
250 grants will be awarded in 2023. this
 
05:42:00.530 --> 05:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
is a three to one match grant program up
 
05:42:03.650 --> 05:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
to ten thousand dollars in response to
 
05:42:06.470 --> 05:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
the Braintree Massachusetts police
 
05:42:08.990 --> 05:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
department losing canine kit for
 
05:42:11.270 --> 05:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
instance we were able to produce a check
 
05:42:13.788 --> 05:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
for ten thousand dollars to go towards
 
05:42:16.430 --> 05:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
replacing their police K-9 for them so I
 
05:42:20.090 --> 05:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
did bring a copy of the application if
 
05:42:22.250 --> 05:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
anyone's interested and it's available
 
05:42:24.708 --> 05:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
online as well for anyone that might
 
05:42:26.868 --> 05:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
have a community that's looking to
 
05:42:28.490 --> 05:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
acquire a police canine so I thought I
 
05:42:31.510 --> 05:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:33.530 --> 05:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:42:36.890 --> 05:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
um do you if if you know how many
 
05:42:40.010 --> 05:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
um facilities do we have in the area to
 
05:42:43.190 --> 05:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
treat emergency treat canines who are
 
05:42:43.200 --> 05:42:44.390 align:start position:0%
treat emergency treat canines who are
injured

05:42:44.390 --> 05:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
injured
 
05:42:46.310 --> 05:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
that would depend on how many emergency
 
05:42:48.830 --> 05:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
veterinary clinics you have
 
05:42:51.110 --> 05:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
um and I expect someone behind me
 
05:42:53.868 --> 05:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
probably could answer that in
 
05:42:55.310 --> 05:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they're kind of
 
05:42:58.010 --> 05:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
geographically by region where they're
 
05:43:01.010 --> 05:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
available and on the implementation of
 
05:43:03.530 --> 05:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
Nero's law the protocols would lay that
 
05:43:05.448 --> 05:43:05.458 align:start position:0%
out in terms of what's what's the
 
05:43:07.550 --> 05:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
nearest emergency veterinary clinic to
 
05:43:07.560 --> 05:43:08.510 align:start position:0%
nearest emergency veterinary clinic to
you

05:43:08.510 --> 05:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:43:10.868 --> 05:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:43:14.690 --> 05:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:17.510 --> 05:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
do you know of any training for the EMTs
 
05:43:19.910 --> 05:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
that are in these ambulances for the
 
05:43:22.730 --> 05:43:22.740 align:start position:0%
dogs because I've only seen one course I
 
05:43:24.170 --> 05:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
tried to sign up for it and it was full
 
05:43:26.990 --> 05:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
before I could even get there well it's
 
05:43:28.850 --> 05:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
I think it's kind of the concept of if
 
05:43:31.788 --> 05:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
you build it they will come once the
 
05:43:35.270 --> 05:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
bill passed in Massachusetts uh for
 
05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
instance Robert Kraft made available
 
05:43:39.948 --> 05:43:39.958 align:start position:0%
Gillette Stadium and they had a large
 
05:43:42.410 --> 05:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
training that was put on there
 
05:43:44.930 --> 05:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
um I think there were four groups of 40
 
05:43:47.750 --> 05:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
that rotated through so it may not be
 
05:43:50.208 --> 05:43:50.218 align:start position:0%
readily available now but I imagine that
 
05:43:53.208 --> 05:43:53.218 align:start position:0%
once the bill passes again that would be
 
05:43:55.910 --> 05:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
part of the implementation I know a lot
 
05:43:58.430 --> 05:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
of our clubs also will donate for
 
05:43:58.440 --> 05:43:59.750 align:start position:0%
of our clubs also will donate for
instance

05:43:59.750 --> 05:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
instance
 
05:44:01.910 --> 05:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
um canine muzzles and other equipment
 
05:44:04.010 --> 05:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
that might be necessarily that's not
 
05:44:07.070 --> 05:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
readily available but um the handlers
 
05:44:09.590 --> 05:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
themselves would have on site for their
 
05:44:12.230 --> 05:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
police K-9 that kind of equipment you
 
05:44:13.368 --> 05:44:13.378 align:start position:0%
know where it would be readily available
 
05:44:14.990 --> 05:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:44:17.510 --> 05:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:44:19.970 --> 05:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
05:44:39.590 --> 05:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:39.600 --> 05:44:42.708 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:44:42.708 --> 05:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:45.590 --> 05:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Dr Cara
 
05:44:47.690 --> 05:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
batchelder and I'm here in today in
 
05:44:50.510 --> 05:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
support of Senate Bill 268. I've been
 
05:44:52.010 --> 05:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
employed as an emergency and Critical
 
05:44:53.270 --> 05:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
Care Veterinarian at the Veterinary
 
05:44:54.890 --> 05:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
Emergency Center in Manchester for about
 
05:44:57.410 --> 05:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
nine years and during that time I've had
 
05:44:58.970 --> 05:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
the privilege of working with the
 
05:45:00.708 --> 05:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
Manchester Police Department's K-9 unit
 
05:45:03.110 --> 05:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
which has allowed me to see just the
 
05:45:05.030 --> 05:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
unique bond that these dogs and their
 
05:45:06.830 --> 05:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
handlers have and how important it is to
 
05:45:08.750 --> 05:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
keep them healthy and fully able to
 
05:45:10.670 --> 05:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
function at their job
 
05:45:14.150 --> 05:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
so unlike your typical house family dog
 
05:45:16.610 --> 05:45:16.620 align:start position:0%
these dogs are in unique high-risk
 
05:45:16.620 --> 05:45:17.590 align:start position:0%
these dogs are in unique high-risk
situations

05:45:17.590 --> 05:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
situations
 
05:45:19.670 --> 05:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
that potentially can result in
 
05:45:21.288 --> 05:45:21.298 align:start position:0%
life-threatening injuries or exposures
 
05:45:23.090 --> 05:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
and this can include anything from
 
05:45:25.910 --> 05:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
gunshot wounds stab wounds heat related
 
05:45:28.670 --> 05:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
illnesses illicit drug exposures and
 
05:45:31.430 --> 05:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
intoxications burn injuries and other
 
05:45:33.470 --> 05:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
blunt force trauma injuries
 
05:45:35.930 --> 05:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately in most instances our
 
05:45:37.548 --> 05:45:37.558 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Community doesn't have the
 
05:45:39.830 --> 05:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
resources to respond immediately to
 
05:45:41.208 --> 05:45:41.218 align:start position:0%
emergencies when they occur in the
 
05:45:43.368 --> 05:45:43.378 align:start position:0%
fields and as a result there's a large
 
05:45:45.288 --> 05:45:45.298 align:start position:0%
gap that exists in the provision of care
 
05:45:48.230 --> 05:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
for our operational canines on scene at
 
05:45:49.850 --> 05:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
the point of injury and during transport
 
05:45:52.250 --> 05:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
to a Veterinary facility
 
05:45:53.448 --> 05:45:53.458 align:start position:0%
um the military's been using their
 
05:45:55.190 --> 05:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
Medics to perform field triage
 
05:45:56.990 --> 05:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
stabilization and transport of their
 
05:45:58.548 --> 05:45:58.558 align:start position:0%
operational canines for quite some time
 
05:46:00.048 --> 05:46:00.058 align:start position:0%
with very good results
 
05:46:01.970 --> 05:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
and so while there's not an organized
 
05:46:03.590 --> 05:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Emergency Medical Services
 
05:46:06.048 --> 05:46:06.058 align:start position:0%
Program here in New Hampshire similar to
 
05:46:08.448 --> 05:46:08.458 align:start position:0%
military Medics our EMTs and paramedics
 
05:46:11.570 --> 05:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
are in the ideal situation
 
05:46:14.448 --> 05:46:14.458 align:start position:0%
to close that Gap in care and perform
 
05:46:16.850 --> 05:46:16.860 align:start position:0%
the nested Theory the necessary tasks to
 
05:46:19.010 --> 05:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
stabilize the dogs in the field
 
05:46:21.288 --> 05:46:21.298 align:start position:0%
so as a result when the dogs reach a
 
05:46:23.390 --> 05:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
Veterinary facility their odds of the
 
05:46:25.010 --> 05:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
successful recovery are significantly
 
05:46:27.650 --> 05:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
increased two of my colleagues and I
 
05:46:29.208 --> 05:46:29.218 align:start position:0%
attended an extensive three-day course
 
05:46:31.670 --> 05:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
in Portland Maine on Advanced first aid
 
05:46:33.830 --> 05:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
for operational canines the goals of
 
05:46:35.930 --> 05:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
this course were to teach handlers and
 
05:46:37.610 --> 05:46:37.620 align:start position:0%
emergency medical responders how to
 
05:46:39.230 --> 05:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
recognize situations where pre-hospital
 
05:46:42.110 --> 05:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
care was indicated how to stabilize the
 
05:46:45.590 --> 05:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
dogs and try to avoid preventable deaths
 
05:46:47.390 --> 05:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
so it was amazing to see during this
 
05:46:49.368 --> 05:46:49.378 align:start position:0%
course how the EMS Personnel were able
 
05:46:51.110 --> 05:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
to do with just a little bit of guidance
 
05:46:53.330 --> 05:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
take their already existing skill set
 
05:46:55.128 --> 05:46:55.138 align:start position:0%
and tools and just translate them into
 
05:46:58.490 --> 05:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
canines we're working my team and I are
 
05:47:01.970 --> 05:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
working with our New Hampshire EMS teams
 
05:47:04.128 --> 05:47:04.138 align:start position:0%
here to set up a similar program for
 
05:47:06.830 --> 05:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
training so that hopefully once we get
 
05:47:08.930 --> 05:47:08.940 align:start position:0%
everything in place we can start rolling
 
05:47:11.690 --> 05:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
out training for for our own handlers
 
05:47:13.970 --> 05:47:13.980 align:start position:0%
and EMS
 
05:47:15.708 --> 05:47:15.718 align:start position:0%
um and hopefully this will allow us to
 
05:47:17.690 --> 05:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
close the gap in care and provide the
 
05:47:19.610 --> 05:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
care that our operational canines in New
 
05:47:21.708 --> 05:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire deserve so I thank you for
 
05:47:24.350 --> 05:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
considering Senate Bill 268 and can
 
05:47:25.670 --> 05:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
certainly take any questions if there
 
05:47:27.288 --> 05:47:27.298 align:start position:0%
are any
 
05:47:29.208 --> 05:47:29.218 align:start position:0%
um if I could
 
05:47:31.368 --> 05:47:31.378 align:start position:0%
ask you the um same question asked
 
05:47:33.230 --> 05:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
before how many facilities are available
 
05:47:35.750 --> 05:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to treat canines on an
 
05:47:37.610 --> 05:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
emergency basis like an emergency room
 
05:47:39.948 --> 05:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
type thing yeah so
 
05:47:43.610 --> 05:47:43.620 align:start position:0%
um there are eight ER type of hospitals
 
05:47:46.850 --> 05:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
that in theory could perform most of
 
05:47:50.990 --> 05:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
these skills there are three hospitals
 
05:47:53.390 --> 05:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
that are that contain Specialists so
 
05:47:55.090 --> 05:47:55.100 align:start position:0%
like boarded surgeons
 
05:47:55.100 --> 05:47:56.770 align:start position:0%
like boarded surgeons
criticalists

05:47:56.770 --> 05:47:56.780 align:start position:0%
criticalists
 
05:47:59.570 --> 05:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologists the the more advanced
 
05:48:02.930 --> 05:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
skills and then really any general
 
05:48:05.510 --> 05:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
practice could do you know your basic
 
05:48:07.490 --> 05:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
stabilization if needed so especially
 
05:48:10.190 --> 05:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
for up north where there's not as many
 
05:48:12.470 --> 05:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals if they needed to go there
 
05:48:14.330 --> 05:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
first and then be transported later to a
 
05:48:16.310 --> 05:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
specialty facility that certainly is an
 
05:48:19.430 --> 05:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
option is there like a rotating schedule
 
05:48:22.070 --> 05:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
like which ones are open 24 hours so
 
05:48:24.830 --> 05:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
that the officers know what the closest
 
05:48:27.650 --> 05:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
one to them is at any given time so I'm
 
05:48:30.170 --> 05:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
I have a list that I have to provide to
 
05:48:32.090 --> 05:48:32.100 align:start position:0%
our Ems for once we get our training
 
05:48:34.070 --> 05:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
program in place unfortunately because
 
05:48:36.110 --> 05:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
there's a shortage of Veterinary staff
 
05:48:38.390 --> 05:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
not every place is open 24 hours
 
05:48:38.400 --> 05:48:40.250 align:start position:0%
not every place is open 24 hours
consistently

05:48:40.250 --> 05:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
consistently
 
05:48:42.470 --> 05:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
um so we'll provide that to them so that
 
05:48:44.690 --> 05:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
any first responder who who goes will
 
05:48:46.910 --> 05:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
have that as part of their you know they
 
05:48:48.410 --> 05:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
have EMS protocols so that could be
 
05:48:50.208 --> 05:48:50.218 align:start position:0%
included in their potentially if they
 
05:48:54.288 --> 05:48:54.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:00.610 --> 05:49:00.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:05.510 --> 05:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:09.110 --> 05:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
Justin romanello ramello
 
05:49:14.750 --> 05:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:20.090 --> 05:49:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:21.470 --> 05:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
05:49:23.330 --> 05:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
um really just a couple clarifications
 
05:49:25.070 --> 05:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
and certainly here for a question so my
 
05:49:26.690 --> 05:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
name is Justin Romano I'm the chief of
 
05:49:28.250 --> 05:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Ems for the State of New
 
05:49:31.070 --> 05:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we regulate all EMS providers
 
05:49:32.810 --> 05:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
05:49:35.270 --> 05:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
um so I don't have the numbers but I
 
05:49:37.610 --> 05:49:37.620 align:start position:0%
will tell you what has changed in the um
 
05:49:40.070 --> 05:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
in the bill before you so under the
 
05:49:43.010 --> 05:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
first section which is definitions we
 
05:49:45.230 --> 05:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
are removing emergency providers that
 
05:49:47.330 --> 05:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
definition and we're removing treatment
 
05:49:49.910 --> 05:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
definition because that's previously
 
05:49:52.970 --> 05:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
defined in 153 A2 which is the
 
05:49:56.030 --> 05:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
definitions for all of RSA 153.
 
05:49:58.850 --> 05:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
and that's changes the order so you only
 
05:50:00.948 --> 05:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
have three definitions for one for law
 
05:50:03.830 --> 05:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer which is a b is
 
05:50:05.628 --> 05:50:05.638 align:start position:0%
going to be operational canine and C
 
05:50:07.850 --> 05:50:07.860 align:start position:0%
would be official duties
 
05:50:10.010 --> 05:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
the only other change under definitions
 
05:50:11.510 --> 05:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
would be within the law enforcement
 
05:50:13.850 --> 05:50:13.860 align:start position:0%
officer section and that's referring to
 
05:50:15.948 --> 05:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
the appropriate RSA that will Define
 
05:50:18.770 --> 05:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
what a law enforcement officer is and
 
05:50:20.750 --> 05:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
then it adds as you read in front of you
 
05:50:22.910 --> 05:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
the the addition of National Guard to
 
05:50:24.730 --> 05:50:24.740 align:start position:0%
that and that's what officer Warner was
 
05:50:26.510 --> 05:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that's what you're
 
05:50:28.610 --> 05:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
05:50:31.250 --> 05:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
um and then the second change
 
05:50:33.650 --> 05:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
uh that actually off somewhere I was
 
05:50:36.010 --> 05:50:36.020 align:start position:0%
referring to is under section two
 
05:50:40.128 --> 05:50:40.138 align:start position:0%
and it's the last uh phrase in section
 
05:50:43.128 --> 05:50:43.138 align:start position:0%
two it removes ambulance services
 
05:50:45.708 --> 05:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
and it adds treatment and that would be
 
05:50:47.510 --> 05:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
in line with other language within the
 
05:50:48.890 --> 05:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
language there's no such thing as
 
05:50:50.570 --> 05:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
ambulance services in the state it's
 
05:50:52.610 --> 05:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
treatment and transport if that makes
 
05:50:52.620 --> 05:50:54.590 align:start position:0%
treatment and transport if that makes
sense

05:50:54.590 --> 05:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
sense
 
05:50:56.628 --> 05:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
and then I'm certainly available to
 
05:50:58.310 --> 05:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
answer any questions I think there's a
 
05:50:59.810 --> 05:50:59.820 align:start position:0%
couple questions that very previously
 
05:51:01.490 --> 05:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
asked that I could answer and put more
 
05:51:05.150 --> 05:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:06.890 --> 05:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
true if you heard a question you've
 
05:51:09.590 --> 05:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to answer so the way we see this
 
05:51:13.190 --> 05:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh once if if this is passed uh it will
 
05:51:15.830 --> 05:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
fall within our normal EMS protocols and
 
05:51:17.510 --> 05:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
it will be what we call a prerequisite
 
05:51:19.970 --> 05:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
protocol which is an additional protocol
 
05:51:22.368 --> 05:51:22.378 align:start position:0%
that EMS providers have available to
 
05:51:24.650 --> 05:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
them through their licensed units
 
05:51:26.810 --> 05:51:26.820 align:start position:0%
and what that allows for is
 
05:51:29.448 --> 05:51:29.458 align:start position:0%
relationships and so it encourages
 
05:51:32.030 --> 05:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
relationships between the officers so
 
05:51:33.590 --> 05:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement officers that have
 
05:51:36.230 --> 05:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
the canines and our EMS providers and
 
05:51:38.690 --> 05:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
the units as well as you know the
 
05:51:40.070 --> 05:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals so who's going to be available
 
05:51:43.548 --> 05:51:43.558 align:start position:0%
24 hours a day and other services that
 
05:51:45.170 --> 05:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
may be needed so there's an additional
 
05:51:47.570 --> 05:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
application process for our prerequisite
 
05:51:50.390 --> 05:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
protocols so the division as well as the
 
05:51:51.890 --> 05:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
boards that
 
05:51:54.170 --> 05:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
um that provide guidance for EMS within
 
05:51:56.510 --> 05:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
the state all understand that everybody
 
05:51:58.368 --> 05:51:58.378 align:start position:0%
is has the appropriate oversight the
 
05:52:00.350 --> 05:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
relationships are there so there's
 
05:52:02.288 --> 05:52:02.298 align:start position:0%
there's nobody kind of left high and dry
 
05:52:05.390 --> 05:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
and so to your question as far as the
 
05:52:07.970 --> 05:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
number of hospitals the way I I view the
 
05:52:09.530 --> 05:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
prerequisite protocol it's going to
 
05:52:11.570 --> 05:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
outline all the hospitals that are
 
05:52:14.150 --> 05:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
available and then as an example for
 
05:52:16.310 --> 05:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester Manchester fire as a
 
05:52:19.010 --> 05:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
non-transport EMS agency in AMR as a
 
05:52:21.590 --> 05:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
transport agency will understand what
 
05:52:23.510 --> 05:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
hospital that the canine Handler prefers
 
05:52:25.788 --> 05:52:25.798 align:start position:0%
for their canine what's available for a
 
05:52:28.010 --> 05:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
given time so all this will be kind of
 
05:52:29.628 --> 05:52:29.638 align:start position:0%
ironed out within that prerequisite
 
05:52:34.970 --> 05:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:34.980 --> 05:52:35.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:52:35.810 --> 05:52:35.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:37.010 --> 05:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
that's really the only other
 
05:52:38.208 --> 05:52:38.218 align:start position:0%
clarification unless there's any
 
05:52:39.288 --> 05:52:39.298 align:start position:0%
questions I certainly can answer
 
05:52:41.390 --> 05:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
anything for the EMS system
 
05:52:43.368 --> 05:52:43.378 align:start position:0%
representative sailing
 
05:52:45.708 --> 05:52:45.718 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm I'm just sorry just
 
05:52:47.030 --> 05:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
thinking back about all the different
 
05:52:47.040 --> 05:52:48.770 align:start position:0%
thinking back about all the different
testimony

05:52:48.770 --> 05:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:52:50.390 --> 05:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
um I recognize that obviously if there's
 
05:52:51.770 --> 05:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
a human who needs transport to an
 
05:52:53.930 --> 05:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
emergency room as well as a canine that
 
05:52:56.090 --> 05:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
the human should get it first
 
05:52:58.788 --> 05:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
is it possible within an ambulance to
 
05:53:01.250 --> 05:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
have them both go and that's just a
 
05:53:03.048 --> 05:53:03.058 align:start position:0%
practical I don't I've not been inside
 
05:53:05.270 --> 05:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
an ambulance except to take my kids on
 
05:53:07.670 --> 05:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
tours so sure so there's there's many
 
05:53:09.110 --> 05:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
different types of ambulances that are
 
05:53:10.970 --> 05:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
out there some are easier to transport
 
05:53:12.470 --> 05:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
multiple patients
 
05:53:16.670 --> 05:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
um than than others I think that um
 
05:53:18.708 --> 05:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
you know the treatment and transport are
 
05:53:20.628 --> 05:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
two different things right and so the
 
05:53:22.670 --> 05:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
ability to treat is the one piece and
 
05:53:24.170 --> 05:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
then how we can transport you know and I
 
05:53:25.670 --> 05:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
think there's flexibilities within that
 
05:53:29.150 --> 05:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
so if there was a situation where
 
05:53:30.708 --> 05:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
um there's no access to an ambulance
 
05:53:32.990 --> 05:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
immediately and and the K-9 needs to be
 
05:53:35.030 --> 05:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
transported we have the benefits of of
 
05:53:37.070 --> 05:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
having a left and right to treat
 
05:53:38.448 --> 05:53:38.458 align:start position:0%
um and then we could find potentially
 
05:53:40.970 --> 05:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
other vehicles at that time but I think
 
05:53:42.770 --> 05:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
what this bill does
 
05:53:45.288 --> 05:53:45.298 align:start position:0%
um is it provides that left and right to
 
05:53:47.570 --> 05:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
to really say this is at the EMT level
 
05:53:50.030 --> 05:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
what treatment modalities can be done at
 
05:53:51.530 --> 05:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
the advanced level at the paramedic
 
05:53:54.048 --> 05:53:54.058 align:start position:0%
level where we didn't have that before
 
05:53:56.208 --> 05:53:56.218 align:start position:0%
um so it wasn't only just the ability to
 
05:53:58.970 --> 05:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
whether to treat and transport or not it
 
05:54:00.650 --> 05:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
was it was this really was kind of the
 
05:54:02.868 --> 05:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
Wild Wild West right and so we've seen
 
05:54:04.548 --> 05:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
in other states where this provides that
 
05:54:06.170 --> 05:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
left and right
 
05:54:08.448 --> 05:54:08.458 align:start position:0%
um and yes absolutely if if there was a
 
05:54:10.010 --> 05:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
case where
 
05:54:11.930 --> 05:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
um we need the the transport you know
 
05:54:14.150 --> 05:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
two people we see a person in a canine
 
05:54:18.410 --> 05:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:20.510 --> 05:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
yeah just um
 
05:54:22.190 --> 05:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
they go to two different places
 
05:54:24.470 --> 05:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
obviously sure so
 
05:54:26.690 --> 05:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
if they were transporting to um
 
05:54:28.430 --> 05:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
obviously the human would be dropped off
 
05:54:30.590 --> 05:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
and then the canine would drop wherever
 
05:54:33.230 --> 05:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
the is that yeah I mean I think that
 
05:54:33.240 --> 05:54:34.070 align:start position:0%
the is that yeah I mean I think that
it's

05:54:34.070 --> 05:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:54:34.080 --> 05:54:34.670 align:start position:0%
it's
um

05:54:34.670 --> 05:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:36.770 --> 05:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
you know I what we certainly don't want
 
05:54:37.850 --> 05:54:37.860 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:54:39.530 --> 05:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
um in any type of you know whether it's
 
05:54:41.390 --> 05:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
admin rule that we create well for this
 
05:54:43.970 --> 05:54:43.980 align:start position:0%
or protocol is is say that you have to
 
05:54:45.288 --> 05:54:45.298 align:start position:0%
do this in a particular order like
 
05:54:46.970 --> 05:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
there's got to be some flexibilities for
 
05:54:48.890 --> 05:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
our providers and I think our our Pro
 
05:54:50.690 --> 05:54:50.700 align:start position:0%
EMS protocols and our patient care
 
05:54:53.510 --> 05:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
protocols allow for that flexibility
 
05:54:55.670 --> 05:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
um and and what's best at the time for
 
05:54:57.048 --> 05:54:57.058 align:start position:0%
all patients
 
05:54:59.090 --> 05:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
um and what's available at the time for
 
05:55:00.770 --> 05:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
all transport modalities and that sort
 
05:55:02.208 --> 05:55:02.218 align:start position:0%
of thing so
 
05:55:03.708 --> 05:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
um you know I think we have that
 
05:55:05.030 --> 05:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility in here to ensure
 
05:55:06.948 --> 05:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
everybody's receiving the care that they
 
05:55:06.958 --> 05:55:08.030 align:start position:0%
everybody's receiving the care that they
need

05:55:08.030 --> 05:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
need
 
05:55:09.770 --> 05:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
um and and have access to the transport
 
05:55:12.048 --> 05:55:12.058 align:start position:0%
mechanisms and you know my thought is in
 
05:55:14.090 --> 05:55:14.100 align:start position:0%
in some of these instances you might you
 
05:55:15.948 --> 05:55:15.958 align:start position:0%
know have if you know you have a
 
05:55:17.270 --> 05:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
potential for a couple patients you're
 
05:55:18.530 --> 05:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
going to have some ambulances standing
 
05:55:19.970 --> 05:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
by potentially assuming it's available
 
05:55:21.650 --> 05:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
in the system
 
05:55:23.810 --> 05:55:23.820 align:start position:0%
um again that treatment is key I think
 
05:55:26.868 --> 05:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
in any case there's there's you know if
 
05:55:28.430 --> 05:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
we didn't have the ability to treat
 
05:55:30.890 --> 05:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
appropriately with the training you know
 
05:55:32.270 --> 05:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
if there wasn't an ambulance available
 
05:55:35.270 --> 05:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know our providers you know might
 
05:55:37.010 --> 05:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
have first been a little flustered at
 
05:55:38.208 --> 05:55:38.218 align:start position:0%
the time where now they have treatment
 
05:55:39.470 --> 05:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
modalities and potentially have
 
05:55:41.030 --> 05:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
treatment when I was in place so they
 
05:55:43.490 --> 05:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
could stabilize until you know that next
 
05:55:46.010 --> 05:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
ambulance is available
 
05:55:46.020 --> 05:55:47.390 align:start position:0%
ambulance is available
okay

05:55:47.390 --> 05:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:55:50.390 --> 05:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
would we I'm wondering if we need to add
 
05:55:51.770 --> 05:55:51.780 align:start position:0%
something in the amendment you were
 
05:55:53.628 --> 05:55:53.638 align:start position:0%
talking about that just says
 
05:55:55.730 --> 05:55:55.740 align:start position:0%
that sort of gives the flexibility in
 
05:55:58.070 --> 05:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
terms of co-transporting if that's the
 
05:55:59.990 --> 05:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
only option I just don't know if we need
 
05:56:01.788 --> 05:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
to add that in I'd prefer to leave the
 
05:56:03.650 --> 05:56:03.660 align:start position:0%
flexibility to the commanders on the
 
05:56:05.570 --> 05:56:05.580 align:start position:0%
scene as long as it's not prohibited for
 
05:56:07.128 --> 05:56:07.138 align:start position:0%
them to make the call
 
05:56:09.590 --> 05:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
um on the ground versus dictating from
 
05:56:13.070 --> 05:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
here but we'll look at it
 
05:56:18.650 --> 05:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:21.350 --> 05:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
I understand that in Massachusetts
 
05:56:22.548 --> 05:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
um there's some training that was
 
05:56:24.530 --> 05:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
required on the part of ambulance uh
 
05:56:28.368 --> 05:56:28.378 align:start position:0%
drivers I and the the effective date on
 
05:56:30.470 --> 05:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
this particular bill is immediately upon
 
05:56:30.480 --> 05:56:31.970 align:start position:0%
this particular bill is immediately upon
passage

05:56:31.970 --> 05:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
passage
 
05:56:34.070 --> 05:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
um given the experience in Massachusetts
 
05:56:36.650 --> 05:56:36.660 align:start position:0%
that you've had a chance to see
 
05:56:40.788 --> 05:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
um uh what is your opinion around the
 
05:56:42.948 --> 05:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
effective date should we leave it as is
 
05:56:46.750 --> 05:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:49.368 --> 05:56:49.378 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
05:56:51.948 --> 05:56:51.958 align:start position:0%
much different than how this how this is
 
05:56:53.090 --> 05:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
written compared to what Massachusetts
 
05:56:53.100 --> 05:56:54.410 align:start position:0%
written compared to what Massachusetts
did

05:56:54.410 --> 05:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
did
 
05:56:56.208 --> 05:56:56.218 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
05:56:59.448 --> 05:56:59.458 align:start position:0%
so Massachusetts basically said that
 
05:57:02.448 --> 05:57:02.458 align:start position:0%
every licensed unit every provider has
 
05:57:06.590 --> 05:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
to must uh treat and transport a K-9 and
 
05:57:09.650 --> 05:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
I think that whereas this may it allows
 
05:57:11.810 --> 05:57:11.820 align:start position:0%
for us to put it into a prerequisite
 
05:57:15.650 --> 05:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
protocol and allows for a licensed unit
 
05:57:17.990 --> 05:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
that may support canine operations so
 
05:57:20.150 --> 05:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
we'll use Manchester as an example it
 
05:57:22.430 --> 05:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
allows them to provide care so we're not
 
05:57:25.250 --> 05:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
going to have 301 Services license units
 
05:57:27.530 --> 05:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
providing care we're giving them the
 
05:57:29.330 --> 05:57:29.340 align:start position:0%
flexibility to decide if they want to do
 
05:57:33.230 --> 05:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
that and so with that again I keep
 
05:57:34.850 --> 05:57:34.860 align:start position:0%
saying the prerequisite protocol we can
 
05:57:38.030 --> 05:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
outline what what skills are going to be
 
05:57:40.310 --> 05:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
or um sorry what scope of practice and
 
05:57:41.690 --> 05:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
treatment modalities are going to be
 
05:57:44.390 --> 05:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
allowed at any particular level and then
 
05:57:46.250 --> 05:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
it's the Departments that that's
 
05:57:48.110 --> 05:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
choosing to apply for this it's their
 
05:57:50.330 --> 05:57:50.340 align:start position:0%
job didn't go out and get that training
 
05:57:52.010 --> 05:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
and I think we could support it as a
 
05:57:53.628 --> 05:57:53.638 align:start position:0%
state we can provide we can't certainly
 
05:57:55.430 --> 05:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
support the entire state to provide
 
05:57:57.170 --> 05:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
training we don't have do the way this
 
05:57:59.690 --> 05:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
is written but we can provide access to
 
05:58:01.190 --> 05:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
the various programs that are out there
 
05:58:03.170 --> 05:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
and there are quite a few
 
05:58:05.030 --> 05:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
um and so like a department that just
 
05:58:07.788 --> 05:58:07.798 align:start position:0%
has EMTs they're not going to need a
 
05:58:09.350 --> 05:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
three-day course you know Massachusetts
 
05:58:11.990 --> 05:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
I believe their entire curriculum with
 
05:58:15.048 --> 05:58:15.058 align:start position:0%
the Practical portion and the the online
 
05:58:17.170 --> 05:58:17.180 align:start position:0%
portions about four hours
 
05:58:19.548 --> 05:58:19.558 align:start position:0%
but I think that different with
 
05:58:21.288 --> 05:58:21.298 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts this is allowing our
 
05:58:24.048 --> 05:58:24.058 align:start position:0%
agencies to do it if they wish and our
 
05:58:25.190 --> 05:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
providers to do it through those
 
05:58:27.350 --> 05:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
agencies but it's not every single
 
05:58:29.090 --> 05:58:29.100 align:start position:0%
service is going to have they have the
 
05:58:30.530 --> 05:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity but they don't have to do it
 
05:58:32.510 --> 05:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense right
 
05:58:35.208 --> 05:58:35.218 align:start position:0%
and one quick follow-up
 
05:58:37.670 --> 05:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure you answered my question
 
05:58:40.070 --> 05:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
just around the effective date uh sure
 
05:58:40.080 --> 05:58:41.810 align:start position:0%
just around the effective date uh sure
so

05:58:41.810 --> 05:58:41.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:58:44.270 --> 05:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
so as of once this becomes effective our
 
05:58:46.310 --> 05:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
departments and license units will have
 
05:58:49.548 --> 05:58:49.558 align:start position:0%
the ability to to do it and then uh we
 
05:58:51.948 --> 05:58:51.958 align:start position:0%
will give them the protocols and all
 
05:58:53.570 --> 05:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
that through our normal protocols so
 
05:58:56.030 --> 05:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
even though it's effective at that point
 
05:58:57.770 --> 05:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
we they still have the opportunity to
 
05:58:59.208 --> 05:58:59.218 align:start position:0%
apply for it and we still would be able
 
05:59:01.190 --> 05:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
to satisfy anything we don't need I
 
05:59:02.270 --> 05:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
don't believe we need any type of grace
 
05:59:05.330 --> 05:59:05.340 align:start position:0%
period the only other piece to this
 
05:59:06.830 --> 05:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
um in
 
05:59:09.470 --> 05:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
it's only from my perspective is that I
 
05:59:10.730 --> 05:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
believe that the board of veterinary
 
05:59:11.930 --> 05:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
medicine is going to have to make
 
05:59:13.548 --> 05:59:13.558 align:start position:0%
modifications to their administrative
 
05:59:16.190 --> 05:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
rules and we will work with them to put
 
05:59:18.708 --> 05:59:18.718 align:start position:0%
in interim rules but again that's just
 
05:59:21.890 --> 05:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
from my perspective because they have
 
05:59:24.470 --> 05:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
the Veterinarian Practice Act that's
 
05:59:26.570 --> 05:59:26.580 align:start position:0%
going to have to they're going to have
 
05:59:28.190 --> 05:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
to have an administrative rule the 308
 
05:59:30.948 --> 05:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
that's going to allow for EMS providers
 
05:59:33.110 --> 05:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
to be waived from providing care under
 
05:59:34.610 --> 05:59:34.620 align:start position:0%
that act
 
05:59:36.948 --> 05:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
um we there's other avenues of EMS care
 
05:59:39.170 --> 05:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
that we do that one of those is mobile
 
05:59:41.030 --> 05:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
integrated Healthcare we have a waiver
 
05:59:42.410 --> 05:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
in place with the Department of Health
 
05:59:45.650 --> 05:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
and Human Services that waives licensed
 
05:59:48.410 --> 05:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
EMS providers from having to be licensed
 
05:59:50.868 --> 05:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
as Home Health Care agents and that's to
 
05:59:52.310 --> 05:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
facilitate us providing community
 
05:59:53.750 --> 05:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
paramedicine and mobile integrated
 
05:59:56.208 --> 05:59:56.218 align:start position:0%
Healthcare and I see us I see the board
 
05:59:59.030 --> 05:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
of veterinary medicine and oplc having
 
06:00:01.430 --> 06:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
to add in administrative rules under 308
 
06:00:03.288 --> 06:00:03.298 align:start position:0%
to facilitate that
 
06:00:05.330 --> 06:00:05.340 align:start position:0%
um but as far as timelines I certainly
 
06:00:07.490 --> 06:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
can't speak for another agency
 
06:00:08.810 --> 06:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:00:10.910 --> 06:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
represent Peru
 
06:00:10.920 --> 06:00:13.548 align:start position:0%
represent Peru
so

06:00:13.548 --> 06:00:13.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:00:15.230 --> 06:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
06:00:17.150 --> 06:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
yep we're gonna
 
06:00:19.548 --> 06:00:19.558 align:start position:0%
my department police department has a
 
06:00:20.750 --> 06:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
dog so we're probably going to jump in
 
06:00:23.868 --> 06:00:23.878 align:start position:0%
on this but if there's a department that
 
06:00:25.368 --> 06:00:25.378 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a dog probably saying hey
 
06:00:27.530 --> 06:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
we don't need to do this but the next
 
06:00:30.350 --> 06:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
town over comes in and their dogs there
 
06:00:31.970 --> 06:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
if they're not
 
06:00:34.070 --> 06:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
in that protocol are we prohibiting them
 
06:00:35.868 --> 06:00:35.878 align:start position:0%
from transporting
 
06:00:37.910 --> 06:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think so I think
 
06:00:37.920 --> 06:00:38.628 align:start position:0%
I don't think so I think
um

06:00:38.628 --> 06:00:38.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:40.310 --> 06:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
my colleagues in the back State Police
 
06:00:42.350 --> 06:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
they they have 20 operational dogs
 
06:00:44.090 --> 06:00:44.100 align:start position:0%
throughout the state they're all over
 
06:00:47.030 --> 06:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
the place I think that departments that
 
06:00:50.330 --> 06:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
cover larger areas will have to
 
06:00:52.368 --> 06:00:52.378 align:start position:0%
um and we'll certainly work with with
 
06:00:54.770 --> 06:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
them to Foster those relationships but
 
06:00:55.430 --> 06:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to have
 
06:00:57.350 --> 06:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
relationships with multiple multiple
 
06:00:59.270 --> 06:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
other departments and I think you know
 
06:01:00.890 --> 06:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
down the road I was speaking with again
 
06:01:04.850 --> 06:01:04.860 align:start position:0%
and uh before before the testimony
 
06:01:07.310 --> 06:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
um I think you know once we'll down the
 
06:01:09.410 --> 06:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
road we'll find that there might be some
 
06:01:11.448 --> 06:01:11.458 align:start position:0%
baseline protocol that we can issue like
 
06:01:13.670 --> 06:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
CPR you know that maybe every department
 
06:01:16.010 --> 06:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
will or every provider should learn that
 
06:01:18.310 --> 06:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
but I think at first starting with this
 
06:01:20.750 --> 06:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
seeing how many departments are are
 
06:01:22.070 --> 06:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
going to take part in this you know
 
06:01:23.570 --> 06:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
really finding out how many dogs and
 
06:01:25.430 --> 06:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
departments are out there that that own
 
06:01:28.610 --> 06:01:28.620 align:start position:0%
canines uh or operational canines I
 
06:01:30.470 --> 06:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
think uh
 
06:01:33.110 --> 06:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
one point or down the road we might get
 
06:01:35.330 --> 06:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
to where it's a general protocol to to
 
06:01:38.090 --> 06:01:38.100 align:start position:0%
take care of that but for right now it's
 
06:01:40.250 --> 06:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
going to be you know if if Nashua has
 
06:01:43.190 --> 06:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
has a a canine uh you know obviously
 
06:01:44.570 --> 06:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
Nashua fire department has a
 
06:01:47.570 --> 06:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
non-transport AMR as a transport but it
 
06:01:49.190 --> 06:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
might be adventitious if they find that
 
06:01:51.770 --> 06:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
they go to other communities you know to
 
06:01:53.628 --> 06:01:53.638 align:start position:0%
to provide you know may or SWAT team
 
06:01:55.250 --> 06:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
goes out to provide services to
 
06:01:57.288 --> 06:01:57.298 align:start position:0%
Merrimack well maybe Merrimack Fire
 
06:01:59.270 --> 06:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
would would need to to take part of this
 
06:02:02.628 --> 06:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
and we have other prerequisite protocols
 
06:02:03.948 --> 06:02:03.958 align:start position:0%
specifically going back to mobile and
 
06:02:05.208 --> 06:02:05.218 align:start position:0%
creative Healthcare where multiple
 
06:02:07.430 --> 06:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
departments are taking part in in that
 
06:02:09.890 --> 06:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
specific protocol so I really think that
 
06:02:11.628 --> 06:02:11.638 align:start position:0%
it can work
 
06:02:11.638 --> 06:02:13.730 align:start position:0%
it can work
oh

06:02:13.730 --> 06:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
oh
 
06:02:16.128 --> 06:02:16.138 align:start position:0%
so what I would like to see is that they
 
06:02:17.690 --> 06:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
can at least transport they may not be
 
06:02:20.390 --> 06:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
able to apply any care but I think just
 
06:02:21.948 --> 06:02:21.958 align:start position:0%
putting him in the bus and transporting
 
06:02:24.350 --> 06:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
is better than letting them sit there or
 
06:02:25.850 --> 06:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
on the back of the cruiser so I actually
 
06:02:28.250 --> 06:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
made that note and so I I appreciate
 
06:02:30.288 --> 06:02:30.298 align:start position:0%
that um I I was thinking about the same
 
06:02:32.868 --> 06:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
thing so I mean the the bill as written
 
06:02:36.288 --> 06:02:36.298 align:start position:0%
right uh and if if it goes into RSA it
 
06:02:37.548 --> 06:02:37.558 align:start position:0%
will allow for the treatment and
 
06:02:40.430 --> 06:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
transport so any any ambulance so we
 
06:02:42.830 --> 06:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
have 476 ambulances give or take away
 
06:02:45.708 --> 06:02:45.718 align:start position:0%
about now 167 transport and license
 
06:02:48.230 --> 06:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
transport in a unit so that gives them
 
06:02:50.330 --> 06:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
the ability to transport it makes that
 
06:02:53.090 --> 06:02:53.100 align:start position:0%
appropriate and and so I what I could
 
06:02:55.190 --> 06:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
see is going back to the Nashville
 
06:02:57.770 --> 06:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
example so Nashville SWAT team they
 
06:02:59.810 --> 06:02:59.820 align:start position:0%
they're a licensed non-transport service
 
06:03:03.170 --> 06:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
in the in the state their Medics could
 
06:03:04.910 --> 06:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
actually take part in this prerequisite
 
06:03:07.250 --> 06:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
protocol and so it's it's allowing their
 
06:03:09.170 --> 06:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
Medics to be the treatment perspective
 
06:03:12.010 --> 06:03:12.020 align:start position:0%
and then AMR as the the contract that
 
06:03:14.330 --> 06:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
non-contractor transport service has the
 
06:03:16.010 --> 06:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
transport they work synergistically
 
06:03:18.590 --> 06:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
together and and they can injured canine
 
06:03:20.570 --> 06:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
gets to the appropriate resource so I
 
06:03:21.708 --> 06:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
think that we don't need to make any
 
06:03:23.750 --> 06:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
modifications to facilitate that that's
 
06:03:23.760 --> 06:03:24.830 align:start position:0%
modifications to facilitate that that's
here

06:03:24.830 --> 06:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:03:26.868 --> 06:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
um but absolutely it would be I didn't
 
06:03:29.030 --> 06:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
want to see a rule prohibiting no I
 
06:03:30.890 --> 06:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think so at all sir
 
06:03:34.548 --> 06:03:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:37.310 --> 06:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:03:38.270 --> 06:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
your testimony you've been very
 
06:03:41.330 --> 06:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
informative are you aware of any good
 
06:03:43.850 --> 06:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
reason as to why it's currently illegal
 
06:03:48.590 --> 06:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
to transport a critically injured canine
 
06:03:48.600 --> 06:03:49.850 align:start position:0%
to transport a critically injured canine
so

06:03:49.850 --> 06:03:49.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:03:52.490 --> 06:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
um from the Bureau of EMS division of
 
06:03:55.010 --> 06:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
fire standard training EMS in in within
 
06:03:57.910 --> 06:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
153 and 5900 I do not see anything
 
06:04:01.548 --> 06:04:01.558 align:start position:0%
however in learning more about this what
 
06:04:03.470 --> 06:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
is prohibitive right now is the
 
06:04:05.868 --> 06:04:05.878 align:start position:0%
Veterinarian Practice Act which is
 
06:04:08.208 --> 06:04:08.218 align:start position:0%
um you know through the the the sorry
 
06:04:10.730 --> 06:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
the vets that I would say is prohibitive
 
06:04:13.190 --> 06:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
because that's saying specifically that
 
06:04:17.030 --> 06:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
any treatment is is required to be a
 
06:04:19.788 --> 06:04:19.798 align:start position:0%
veterinarian or a veterinarian clinic
 
06:04:23.750 --> 06:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:27.770 --> 06:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
I think that what this bill will do is
 
06:04:29.810 --> 06:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's some sort of
 
06:04:31.788 --> 06:04:31.798 align:start position:0%
waiver in place for our providers to
 
06:04:33.830 --> 06:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
provide that care which into the
 
06:04:36.170 --> 06:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
veterinarian care act but then it also
 
06:04:38.150 --> 06:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
provides that left and right I made
 
06:04:40.128 --> 06:04:40.138 align:start position:0%
mention of earlier like I think you know
 
06:04:42.410 --> 06:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
our Protocols are robust for human
 
06:04:42.420 --> 06:04:43.970 align:start position:0%
our Protocols are robust for human
patients

06:04:43.970 --> 06:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
patients
 
06:04:47.150 --> 06:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
um and it allows you know our providers
 
06:04:49.070 --> 06:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
to to treat all patients of State
 
06:04:51.410 --> 06:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
Statewide EMS protocols
 
06:04:54.410 --> 06:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
um and and we could do a lot in
 
06:04:56.810 --> 06:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
we need that left and right I think for
 
06:04:59.030 --> 06:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
our canines there's a reason why there's
 
06:05:01.010 --> 06:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
a Board of Medicine in in that sort of
 
06:05:03.410 --> 06:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
airport of veterinarian care so I think
 
06:05:04.850 --> 06:05:04.860 align:start position:0%
it's important and I think that's why
 
06:05:08.150 --> 06:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:09.770 --> 06:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
06:05:09.780 --> 06:05:14.090 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
oh

06:05:14.090 --> 06:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:16.730 --> 06:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
so is that something we should put in
 
06:05:18.590 --> 06:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
this bill that repeals that veterinarian
 
06:05:20.690 --> 06:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
part I don't I know my opinion I don't
 
06:05:21.948 --> 06:05:21.958 align:start position:0%
want to I don't think we need to repeal
 
06:05:24.650 --> 06:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
it I just think I think what this RSA
 
06:05:26.570 --> 06:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
will do and we've seen in other places I
 
06:05:30.288 --> 06:05:30.298 align:start position:0%
made mention the mih piece so 153 you
 
06:05:32.030 --> 06:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
know that's obviously it's an RSA it's a
 
06:05:34.430 --> 06:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
law and that's going to facilitate
 
06:05:37.490 --> 06:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
change within the administrative rules
 
06:05:39.650 --> 06:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
for the veterinarian boards
 
06:05:41.990 --> 06:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and so I think this is fine the way
 
06:05:44.030 --> 06:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
it is because it's a law even though
 
06:05:46.368 --> 06:05:46.378 align:start position:0%
it's a law that governs you know EMS I
 
06:05:48.170 --> 06:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
still think it needs to be applied to
 
06:05:50.330 --> 06:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
those administrative rules because I'd
 
06:05:52.010 --> 06:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
hate to run into a roadblock I don't
 
06:05:54.288 --> 06:05:54.298 align:start position:0%
think I've I've looked into it I've
 
06:05:55.788 --> 06:05:55.798 align:start position:0%
spoken to my colleagues I think I don't
 
06:06:02.590 --> 06:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:05.090 --> 06:06:05.100 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your time thank you does
 
06:06:06.590 --> 06:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to testify who's not
 
06:06:08.090 --> 06:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
testified on this bill
 
06:06:09.890 --> 06:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
seeing Nana hereby closest public
 
06:06:09.900 --> 06:06:13.970 align:start position:0%
seeing Nana hereby closest public
hearing

06:06:13.970 --> 06:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:13.980 --> 06:06:19.310 align:start position:0%
 
that

06:06:19.310 --> 06:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:25.490 --> 06:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:27.410 --> 06:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
at this point I'm open to public hearing
 
06:06:32.750 --> 06:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:44.750 --> 06:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:54.770 --> 06:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:56.750 --> 06:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
oh thank you very much
 
06:07:02.690 --> 06:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:04.368 --> 06:07:04.378 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:07:20.750 --> 06:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:20.760 --> 06:07:36.548 align:start position:0%
 
somebody

06:07:36.548 --> 06:07:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:38.990 --> 06:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
great thank you so much thank you Mr
 
06:07:40.910 --> 06:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
chair good afternoon again members of
 
06:07:42.650 --> 06:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
06:07:44.150 --> 06:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
Becky Whitley and I'm honored to serve
 
06:07:45.890 --> 06:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
Senate District 15 which includes
 
06:07:48.830 --> 06:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
Concord Beau Penacook and Hopkinton
 
06:07:51.350 --> 06:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
so today I am proud to introduce Senate
 
06:07:54.110 --> 06:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
Bill 251 establishing a committee to
 
06:07:56.628 --> 06:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
study the long-term impact of the New
 
06:08:00.048 --> 06:08:00.058 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Adult Parole system folks in
 
06:08:02.510 --> 06:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
this committee may be well versed in
 
06:08:04.430 --> 06:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
what the system does but if not
 
06:08:06.530 --> 06:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
probation and parole is actually
 
06:08:09.530 --> 06:08:09.540 align:start position:0%
designed to lower prison populations and
 
06:08:11.990 --> 06:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
help people succeed in the community but
 
06:08:15.830 --> 06:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
we have new data available to us that is
 
06:08:17.330 --> 06:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
suggesting it might have the opposite
 
06:08:17.340 --> 06:08:18.230 align:start position:0%
suggesting it might have the opposite
effect

06:08:18.230 --> 06:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
effect
 
06:08:19.970 --> 06:08:19.980 align:start position:0%
the Council of state government again
 
06:08:21.890 --> 06:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
who was actually just recently here in
 
06:08:24.410 --> 06:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
the state their Justice Center recently
 
06:08:26.270 --> 06:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
engaged Corrections and Community
 
06:08:29.330 --> 06:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
Supervision leaders in 50 states to
 
06:08:31.128 --> 06:08:31.138 align:start position:0%
develop the first complete picture of
 
06:08:33.530 --> 06:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
how probation and parole violations make
 
06:08:36.948 --> 06:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
up States prison populations the Council
 
06:08:39.170 --> 06:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
of State government's analysis showed
 
06:08:41.750 --> 06:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
that 45 percent of State Prison
 
06:08:44.690 --> 06:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
admissions Nationwide are actually due
 
06:08:47.208 --> 06:08:47.218 align:start position:0%
to violations of probation or parole for
 
06:08:49.850 --> 06:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
new offenses or technical violations
 
06:08:52.010 --> 06:08:52.020 align:start position:0%
so folks may be well aware that
 
06:08:53.990 --> 06:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
technical violations such as missing
 
06:08:55.850 --> 06:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
appointments with supervision officers
 
06:08:58.548 --> 06:08:58.558 align:start position:0%
or failing drug tests account for nearly
 
06:09:01.128 --> 06:09:01.138 align:start position:0%
one-fourth of all state prison
 
06:09:02.990 --> 06:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
admissions I think that was a pretty
 
06:09:04.970 --> 06:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
startling statistic when I heard it and
 
06:09:07.070 --> 06:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
I was pretty shocked about it but
 
06:09:09.770 --> 06:09:09.780 align:start position:0%
actually what was even more startling to
 
06:09:11.708 --> 06:09:11.718 align:start position:0%
me was the statistic in New Hampshire
 
06:09:14.810 --> 06:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
whereas nationally it's 45 percent of
 
06:09:18.048 --> 06:09:18.058 align:start position:0%
our prison population are due to these
 
06:09:21.530 --> 06:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
probation violations in New Hampshire 60
 
06:09:23.990 --> 06:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
percent of State Prison admissions are
 
06:09:26.750 --> 06:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
due to supervision violations and I
 
06:09:28.850 --> 06:09:28.860 align:start position:0%
think that disparity with the rest of
 
06:09:31.128 --> 06:09:31.138 align:start position:0%
the country tells me that it's really
 
06:09:32.868 --> 06:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
time to just study this issue in New
 
06:09:35.090 --> 06:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to make sure that the entire
 
06:09:37.788 --> 06:09:37.798 align:start position:0%
system has the impact and the effect
 
06:09:40.610 --> 06:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
that it was designed to have
 
06:09:43.010 --> 06:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
I think a committee uh could answer
 
06:09:45.470 --> 06:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
questions like how many people in New
 
06:09:48.410 --> 06:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are on probation or parole how
 
06:09:50.448 --> 06:09:50.458 align:start position:0%
are technical violations handled in New
 
06:09:52.610 --> 06:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire compared to other states what
 
06:09:54.410 --> 06:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
impact does supervision violations have
 
06:09:56.690 --> 06:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
on our local jails in New Hampshire in
 
06:09:58.610 --> 06:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
terms of cost how do New Hampshire
 
06:10:00.650 --> 06:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
policies impact the length of time that
 
06:10:02.930 --> 06:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
people are on probation and parole what
 
06:10:04.610 --> 06:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
types of new offenses are people on
 
06:10:06.610 --> 06:10:06.620 align:start position:0%
supervision being sent to prison for
 
06:10:09.048 --> 06:10:09.058 align:start position:0%
what has New Hampshire done to scale up
 
06:10:10.730 --> 06:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
implementation of supervision practice
 
06:10:13.788 --> 06:10:13.798 align:start position:0%
practices and programs designed to
 
06:10:15.490 --> 06:10:15.500 align:start position:0%
actually reduce new Criminal behavior
 
06:10:18.048 --> 06:10:18.058 align:start position:0%
and of course what's important for this
 
06:10:19.850 --> 06:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
legislature to consider is how much do
 
06:10:22.250 --> 06:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
we invest annually in supervision
 
06:10:23.750 --> 06:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
and how much of the supervision
 
06:10:26.570 --> 06:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
violations actually cost our state
 
06:10:29.030 --> 06:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
so I think it's also important to take
 
06:10:31.250 --> 06:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to re to review best
 
06:10:33.590 --> 06:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
practices what does the research tells
 
06:10:35.868 --> 06:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
us that is most effective and for this
 
06:10:37.788 --> 06:10:37.798 align:start position:0%
legislator to make recommendations and
 
06:10:39.650 --> 06:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
practices that will help deliver better
 
06:10:43.368 --> 06:10:43.378 align:start position:0%
outcomes for people who are on uh or
 
06:10:45.830 --> 06:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
under supervision for families for our
 
06:10:48.530 --> 06:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
communities to ensure that the all the
 
06:10:50.510 --> 06:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
money that we do spend on this system is
 
06:10:52.070 --> 06:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
used efficiently
 
06:10:54.350 --> 06:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions but I am
 
06:10:57.708 --> 06:10:57.718 align:start position:0%
certainly not an expert on this issue
 
06:10:59.750 --> 06:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
um I think it's worthy of study based on
 
06:11:03.048 --> 06:11:03.058 align:start position:0%
this uh data that we have seen but I am
 
06:11:04.368 --> 06:11:04.378 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions that I ask
 
06:11:05.628 --> 06:11:05.638 align:start position:0%
for the committee's support of this Bill
 
06:11:08.570 --> 06:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Senator
 
06:11:10.430 --> 06:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
um you probably are an expert on
 
06:11:12.590 --> 06:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
scheduling do you think that we will
 
06:11:15.470 --> 06:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
have enough time to give this a serious
 
06:11:17.570 --> 06:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
look between now and the deadline or do
 
06:11:19.010 --> 06:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
you think this would be better as a
 
06:11:19.020 --> 06:11:21.590 align:start position:0%
you think this would be better as a
commission

06:11:21.590 --> 06:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:23.750 --> 06:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
so we did put I uh thank you for that
 
06:11:26.208 --> 06:11:26.218 align:start position:0%
question we did put it as a committee I
 
06:11:26.218 --> 06:11:27.048 align:start position:0%
question we did put it as a committee I
think

06:11:27.048 --> 06:11:27.058 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:11:29.930 --> 06:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
um commissions can be you know they have
 
06:11:31.670 --> 06:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
their benefits and having more people at
 
06:11:34.490 --> 06:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
the table but they can take longer I
 
06:11:37.310 --> 06:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
think um we have all the data at our
 
06:11:38.930 --> 06:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
fingertips we just have to collate it
 
06:11:40.310 --> 06:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
which is why we thought a committee was
 
06:11:42.350 --> 06:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
better suited to do that
 
06:11:43.850 --> 06:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:11:45.708 --> 06:11:45.718 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler last question of
 
06:11:47.448 --> 06:11:47.458 align:start position:0%
the day Mr chairman and I thank you for
 
06:11:51.430 --> 06:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh recognizing me so my promises
 
06:11:54.350 --> 06:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
thank you but I just wanted you to
 
06:11:55.670 --> 06:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
repeat the statistic that you said at
 
06:11:56.990 --> 06:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
the beginning of your testimony it was
 
06:12:00.470 --> 06:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
45 to 60 in the state but what was
 
06:12:02.930 --> 06:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
um so the it was the council state
 
06:12:05.448 --> 06:12:05.458 align:start position:0%
government their analysis said that 45
 
06:12:08.628 --> 06:12:08.638 align:start position:0%
of State Prison admissions Nationwide
 
06:12:11.150 --> 06:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
are due to violations of probation or
 
06:12:13.010 --> 06:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
parole for new offenses or technical
 
06:12:17.030 --> 06:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
violations but in New Hampshire 60 of
 
06:12:18.410 --> 06:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
State Prison admissions are due to
 
06:12:22.030 --> 06:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
supervision violations so it's a pretty
 
06:12:27.770 --> 06:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:31.730 --> 06:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:33.890 --> 06:12:33.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
06:12:36.048 --> 06:12:36.058 align:start position:0%
um are you aware that the legislative
 
06:12:38.810 --> 06:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
budget assistant did a pretty
 
06:12:40.730 --> 06:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
comprehensive review of the parole
 
06:12:43.850 --> 06:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
system I think it was in 2019 and
 
06:12:45.470 --> 06:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
um have you had a chance to look at that
 
06:12:46.670 --> 06:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
and do you think it would be something
 
06:12:49.670 --> 06:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
that would factor into what you would
 
06:12:51.590 --> 06:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
like this commission to do yeah I'm
 
06:12:52.970 --> 06:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
aware of it
 
06:12:54.170 --> 06:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
um and I think it would absolutely
 
06:12:56.390 --> 06:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
inform the work of the committee thank
 
06:13:00.650 --> 06:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:02.390 --> 06:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions thank you
 
06:13:06.590 --> 06:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:08.990 --> 06:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes Mr Joseph Les
 
06:13:09.000 --> 06:13:20.530 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes Mr Joseph Les
Collins

06:13:20.530 --> 06:13:20.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:22.788 --> 06:13:22.798 align:start position:0%

06:13:25.670 --> 06:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
my name is Joseph Wisconsin I will be
 
06:13:26.868 --> 06:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
representing the American civil
 
06:13:29.030 --> 06:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
liberties Union and myself in full
 
06:13:32.270 --> 06:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
support of this Senate Bill 251
 
06:13:34.910 --> 06:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
you heard many statistics and data
 
06:13:36.230 --> 06:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
points about the parole system
 
06:13:37.788 --> 06:13:37.798 align:start position:0%
specifically for New Hampshire that I
 
06:13:40.610 --> 06:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
don't want to go over again what I do
 
06:13:42.048 --> 06:13:42.058 align:start position:0%
want to highlight though is the fact
 
06:13:44.628 --> 06:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire does rank in the
 
06:13:46.990 --> 06:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
bottom 10 percent for
 
06:13:49.430 --> 06:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
four monthly admissions Across the
 
06:13:49.440 --> 06:13:50.270 align:start position:0%
four monthly admissions Across the
Nation

06:13:50.270 --> 06:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
Nation
 
06:13:51.770 --> 06:13:51.780 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I know that we strive
 
06:13:53.810 --> 06:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
for excellence so to be in the the
 
06:13:56.330 --> 06:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
bottom of the the nation especially for
 
06:13:58.310 --> 06:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
a statistic like that I think is is
 
06:14:00.350 --> 06:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
quite embarrassing and problematic for
 
06:14:03.110 --> 06:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire community
 
06:14:06.948 --> 06:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
the as we heard like around 50 or more
 
06:14:09.110 --> 06:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
of people that are admitted each month
 
06:14:10.910 --> 06:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire prison is for a
 
06:14:12.530 --> 06:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
violation of parole
 
06:14:14.570 --> 06:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
into the cost of sixty four thousand
 
06:14:17.570 --> 06:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
dollars annually uh myself when I first
 
06:14:19.788 --> 06:14:19.798 align:start position:0%
started uh my prison sentence it was
 
06:14:21.230 --> 06:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
only twenty two thousand dollars it's at
 
06:14:22.730 --> 06:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
sixty four thousand dollars now annually
 
06:14:24.650 --> 06:14:24.660 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire Community payers to
 
06:14:27.708 --> 06:14:27.718 align:start position:0%
uh to fund uh the cost of incarcerating
 
06:14:29.390 --> 06:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
people and I think that we have
 
06:14:31.190 --> 06:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
alternative solutions that could be used
 
06:14:33.048 --> 06:14:33.058 align:start position:0%
one of them being the halfway house
 
06:14:34.970 --> 06:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
system where there is a seven day
 
06:14:36.890 --> 06:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
sanction that is allowed for individuals
 
06:14:39.410 --> 06:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
uh for violating their parole instead of
 
06:14:40.910 --> 06:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
sending them back to the prison system
 
06:14:44.930 --> 06:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
and last year alone uh it was used it
 
06:14:46.430 --> 06:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
was not used once
 
06:14:49.010 --> 06:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
and so I think that we need to take a
 
06:14:51.350 --> 06:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
look at some of the ways that we are uh
 
06:14:53.390 --> 06:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
applying Corrections and are we backing
 
06:14:56.090 --> 06:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
the system up or are we uh creating
 
06:14:58.910 --> 06:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
blockages for people uh while they are
 
06:15:00.350 --> 06:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
trying to transition
 
06:15:02.030 --> 06:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
one of the last things I would like to
 
06:15:04.670 --> 06:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh to say in closing is that last year
 
06:15:06.170 --> 06:15:06.180 align:start position:0%
while we were working on the study
 
06:15:08.990 --> 06:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
committee bill for the truth and
 
06:15:11.150 --> 06:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
sentencing as a matter of fact I
 
06:15:13.128 --> 06:15:13.138 align:start position:0%
received a letter from the parole
 
06:15:16.490 --> 06:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
department that had stated uh that had
 
06:15:18.070 --> 06:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
what they had done is they had backdated
 
06:15:21.350 --> 06:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh supervisor fees to the day that I had
 
06:15:23.330 --> 06:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
come out of prison my parole officer
 
06:15:24.948 --> 06:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
when I first came home had recognized
 
06:15:26.750 --> 06:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
that I did a lot of volunteer work and
 
06:15:28.910 --> 06:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
chose not to charge me supervisor fees
 
06:15:30.890 --> 06:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
to remain out in the community while I
 
06:15:32.690 --> 06:15:32.700 align:start position:0%
was doing the volunteer work through
 
06:15:35.270 --> 06:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
diversion works and and a mentorship
 
06:15:37.548 --> 06:15:37.558 align:start position:0%
program however I got a letter that
 
06:15:39.110 --> 06:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
backdated it to the day and said that I
 
06:15:41.930 --> 06:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
owed that money in full or I would be in
 
06:15:44.030 --> 06:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
violation of My Parole which essentially
 
06:15:45.948 --> 06:15:45.958 align:start position:0%
means that if I didn't pay that money in
 
06:15:47.448 --> 06:15:47.458 align:start position:0%
full I would have gone back to prison
 
06:15:49.250 --> 06:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
regard even though I was in the middle
 
06:15:51.170 --> 06:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
of the work that I was doing
 
06:15:53.510 --> 06:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
for some people on parole that that I
 
06:15:54.590 --> 06:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
just would like to paint a picture of
 
06:15:55.730 --> 06:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
what that does getting a letter like
 
06:15:57.650 --> 06:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
that that's that that's panic panic sets
 
06:15:59.448 --> 06:15:59.458 align:start position:0%
in immediately for some people which
 
06:16:02.330 --> 06:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
then starts uh um starts to overwhelm
 
06:16:04.910 --> 06:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
their sense of logic and reasoning and
 
06:16:06.650 --> 06:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
after that Panic they start to compare
 
06:16:08.690 --> 06:16:08.700 align:start position:0%
you know the maybe the negative
 
06:16:09.770 --> 06:16:09.780 align:start position:0%
experiences they had with the
 
06:16:11.270 --> 06:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
incarceration system as opposed to what
 
06:16:13.190 --> 06:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
they have built out and then that sets a
 
06:16:15.530 --> 06:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
thought process and what we need to do
 
06:16:18.410 --> 06:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
is evaluate are we setting people up for
 
06:16:20.510 --> 06:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
failure through the checks and balances
 
06:16:21.890 --> 06:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
that we have in the system or are we
 
06:16:23.090 --> 06:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
creating something that's really going
 
06:16:28.610 --> 06:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:30.350 --> 06:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
I just would like to know one of the
 
06:16:31.670 --> 06:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
questions to come out of this commission
 
06:16:33.948 --> 06:16:33.958 align:start position:0%
if this committee is established is are
 
06:16:37.070 --> 06:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
we still benefiting from the the
 
06:16:38.990 --> 06:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
situations of incarcerated or formally

06:17:34.430 --> 06:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
be based on a monthly system
 
06:17:35.930 --> 06:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
