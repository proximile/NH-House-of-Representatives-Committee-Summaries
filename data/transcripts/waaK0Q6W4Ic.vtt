00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
this bill on his behalf Senate Bill 162

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
vaccinations for dogs cats and ferrets
 
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
this bill makes the initial period for
 
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
an exemption from the rabies vaccination
 
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
for dogs cats and animals annual with
 
00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:54.139 align:start position:0%

the other two pieces that Senator Pearl
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
wished for me to introduce to the
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
committee was that he had worked with
 
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture to get
 
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
this language set for this bill I
 
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
believe there are a couple people who
 
00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:09.539 align:start position:0%
want to speak on this as well behind me
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
and this bill was also brought on behalf
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
of a constituent unfortunately I won't
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
be able to take any questions and that
 
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
will conclude my introduction
 
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I appreciate it
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
does everyone have a copy of SB 162
 
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
in their possession okay thank you
 
00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:32.699 align:start position:0%
so thank you madam chair we can proceed
 
00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:37.139 align:start position:0%
then of our next speaker on this bill is
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner Sean Jasper from the
 
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture good morning
 
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.670 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture good morning
commissioner

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.670 align:start position:0%
commissioner
foreign

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:48.419 align:start position:0%
is for one year and then thereafter it's
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
every three
 
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
and then in this case we're talking
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
about an exemption so there is actually
 
00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
no rabies vaccination this is just
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
certifying on a yearly basis that there
 
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
is a an issue that would not be in the
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
animal's best interest to to have that
 
00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:08.699 align:start position:0%
vaccination I appreciate that thank you
 
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative smart good morning
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
hi guys good morning everybody thank you
 
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.230 align:start position:0%
madam chair
um

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.430 align:start position:0%
 
what

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
I guess I I don't understand what would
 
00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
be the harm in the animals what is
 
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
harming The Animals by having a rabies
 
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.290 align:start position:0%
harming The Animals by having a rabies
vaccination

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
um that is something that I think the
 
00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:31.139 align:start position:0%
gentleman who is going to speak after
 
00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:33.539 align:start position:0%
after me could could speak to I'm not
 
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
really familiar with the health issue
 
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.389 align:start position:0%
really familiar with the health issue
um

00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
you know the real difference here is
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
that instead of going to two
 
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
veterinarians every time every year this
 
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
would just be one so it's really having
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
the initial certification and then
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
than just saying all right you only need
 
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
to go to one instead of two can I ask
 
00:08:59.690 --> 00:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
them yes but just to clarify your
 
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
question because I've been on uh we've
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
heard rabies bills in the past and uh as
 
00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
I understand there are some uh pet
 
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
owners who say that they're pets after
 
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:14.220 align:start position:0%
they get a rabies vaccination get
 
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
extremely sick
 
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
they have reactions just as humans may
 
00:09:20.329 --> 00:09:20.339 align:start position:0%
have some reactions to certain
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
vaccinations as well
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
so in order for them to protect their
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
animals from having these kinds of
 
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.690 align:start position:0%
animals from having these kinds of
reactions

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:28.700 align:start position:0%
reactions
 
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:31.580 align:start position:0%
which some of them are life-threatening
 
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:34.860 align:start position:0%
they ask for exemptions from the rabies
 
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
vaccination requirement so all animal so
 
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
not everybody's Exempted only if they
 
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
have a reaction exactly
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you madam
 
00:09:52.009 --> 00:09:52.019 align:start position:0%
chair I guess I I also have a brief
 
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
question with lines I guess nine and a
 
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
half through
 
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.370 align:start position:0%
half through
12.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:57.380 align:start position:0%
12.
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
what happens in the event that there
 
00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:02.459 align:start position:0%
isn't a local animal control officer who
 
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
would be the presiding authority over
 
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.750 align:start position:0%
would be the presiding authority over
that

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:12.530 align:start position:0%
that
uh

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
uh local well the police are always the
 
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
local animal control office they may not
 
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
have somebody designated all they
 
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
believe they do but that is a police
 
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
function to be
 
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
um Animal Control
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
so in the event that there's not a
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
specific follow-up Madam chair yes sure
 
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so in the event
 
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
that there isn't a specific named local
 
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.430 align:start position:0%
that there isn't a specific named local
rabies

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
rabies
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
Control Authority you would that would
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
bother the police yes and I you know in
 
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
In fairness this whole issue we know
 
00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:47.459 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot more unvaccinated
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
animals out there who should be
 
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinated but who are not uh than there
 
00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:55.019 align:start position:0%
ever would be animals that would be
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
exempt under this
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
so there is that issue you know not
 
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
unfortunately not every pet owner is
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
responsible in not only every pet owner
 
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
gets a rabies vaccination for their
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
animal as required
 
00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:09.959 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
for the commissioner
 
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much uh
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper as I told you I
 
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
would be a very poor substitute for Dr
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
Crawford I'm sorry uh representative
 
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.930 align:start position:0%
Crawford I'm sorry uh representative
Bixby

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
Bixby
 
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.470 align:start position:0%
Bixby
um

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.329 --> 00:11:29.339 align:start position:0%
having heard this presented in the
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
Senate I think one thing that came out
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
there and if you you can confirm this is
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
that one of the reasons for
 
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
having the re being reduced from needing
 
00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:43.019 align:start position:0%
three signatures initially to one
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
signature thereafter is that the three
 
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
signatures become a bit of a paperwork
 
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
work burden for the Department is that
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
correct uh I would imagine it would
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
would be we I don't believe we have many
 
00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
exemptions but I would say that that is
 
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
another issue when uh and after the
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
initial exemption really does not seem
 
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
to serve a real purpose
 
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:14.579 align:start position:0%
I would like to call now Chuck Douglas
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:19.079 align:start position:0%
microphone good morning
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
as the speaker
 
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959 align:start position:0%
did not say
 
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
um this actually is and I know you've
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
heard it uh actually a basically a
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Bill to clean up
 
00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
the requirement that representative
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
Bixby noted which is that if you want to
 
00:13:07.449 --> 00:13:07.459 align:start position:0%
have your dog cat exempt from rabies
 
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
because they had in the case of my dog
 
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
an anaphylactic shock the dog almost
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
died at Russell Animal Hospital here in
 
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.290 align:start position:0%
died at Russell Animal Hospital here in
Concord

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
Concord
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
they were able to save her little four
 
00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
pound Yorkie but
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
it led me to look into this whole
 
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
question of rabies and the exemption
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
the law already has the exemption so
 
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:35.700 align:start position:0%
we're not asking you to expand or
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
subtract from what the law is
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
but every single year
 
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:45.260 align:start position:0%
to get our dog
 
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
registered annually in our town
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
we have to get the vet at Russell to
 
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
reaffirm that she would get an
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
anaphylactic shock and die
 
00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:01.019 align:start position:0%
then we've got the fun part of finding a
 
00:14:01.019 --> 00:14:02.810 align:start position:0%
then we've got the fun part of finding a
diplomat

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
diplomat
 
00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
uh in the veterinary field that's like a
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
board-certified surgeon
 
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
try to find one of those in the North
 
00:14:11.399 --> 00:14:12.970 align:start position:0%
try to find one of those in the North
country

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:12.980 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
try to find a vet anywhere you've got a
 
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
long waiting period then you've got to
 
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
find one who is a diplomat
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
and then Dr Crawford the State Vet has
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
to sign off
 
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
so all this would do
 
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:32.060 align:start position:0%
is save a lot of paperwork
 
00:14:35.329 --> 00:14:35.339 align:start position:0%
because after the first
 
00:14:38.569 --> 00:14:38.579 align:start position:0%
time the dog or cat has been certified
 
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:41.060 align:start position:0%
to be exempt
 
00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.610 align:start position:0%
to be exempt
thereafter

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:42.620 align:start position:0%
thereafter
 
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:47.300 align:start position:0%
it would just need their vet to annually
 
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
recertify so we're not trying to avoid
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
a vat looking at the situation for your
 
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.329 align:start position:0%
a vat looking at the situation for your
pet

00:14:55.329 --> 00:14:55.339 align:start position:0%
pet
 
00:14:55.339 --> 00:14:57.290 align:start position:0%
pet
but

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.150 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
it's very onerous and I don't know how
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
people out in the rural areas do it I
 
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
mean we're in Concord area it's you can
 
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
find a diplomat he comes to caves once a
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
week so we have to schedule our magic
 
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
day when he's going to be there
 
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
he doesn't know anything about the dog
 
00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:18.899 align:start position:0%
but he figures well if Russell Animal
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
Hospital says it's okay it's good with
 
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.069 align:start position:0%
Hospital says it's okay it's good with
me

00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
then we have to go to Sean's office and
 
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
have Dr Crawford sign off and to do that
 
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
every year I predict there are a lot of
 
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
citizens who aren't doing it at all
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
because they can't they can't find a
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
diplomat they don't know about the law
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
or they don't care we care but we would
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
like to make this process a little bit
 
00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:48.779 align:start position:0%
simpler and that's really all it does
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's no hidden agenda no secret
 
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
ball being hidden from you where in
 
00:15:57.889 --> 00:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
August they'll read you know thousands
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
die from unvaccinated dogs or anything
 
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
in fact the law still says as is our
 
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.370 align:start position:0%
in fact the law still says as is our
case

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
we can't allow our dog Outdoors unless
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
she's on a leash
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
and frankly we don't let her outdoor
 
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
anyway because she's kind of Eagle meat
 
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.490 align:start position:0%
anyway because she's kind of Eagle meat
but

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
um we
 
00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:25.139 align:start position:0%
we also have to have the dog on a leash
 
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
that doesn't change
 
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
so you're not going to have pit bulls
 
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
running around unvaccinated terrorizing
 
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.670 align:start position:0%
running around unvaccinated terrorizing
neighborhoods

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods
 
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
it's very rare but there are animals
 
00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:44.339 align:start position:0%
that just like humans my wife is
 
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
allergic to penicillin
 
00:16:50.829 --> 00:16:50.839 align:start position:0%
I've got a kid that's allergic to latex
 
00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:53.459 align:start position:0%
and that's the same thing in the animal
 
00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:57.380 align:start position:0%
world so it's really that simple
 
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
it would be in the interest of everyone
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
who has gone through the process of
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
getting their dogged or cat
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
properly exempt to just not have to
 
00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:14.459 align:start position:0%
fight to find this second vet every year
 
00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:18.419 align:start position:0%
as well as Dr Crawford so it's a it's a
 
00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:20.819 align:start position:0%
way to simplify the process
 
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
be glad to take any questions Madam
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
chair thank you very much a question
 
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
representative germano thank you madam
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
questions and and I think you've
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
answered at least part of my question
 
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
and something you just said so and
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
looking at lines nine through eleven and
 
00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:39.539 align:start position:0%
then 12 and 13 uh there would seem to be
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
kind of two scenarios here right nine
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
through eleven referred to an Exempted
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
animal Shelby remain uh maintained in
 
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
strict rabies isolation under conditions
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
that are at the discretion Etc until sex
 
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
time is the medical condition has been
 
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
resolved right so if there's a temporary
 
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
I imagine if an animal has an illness
 
00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
right and a vaccination at that time is
 
00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
delayed or right and then at that point
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
your local veterinarian could determine
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
that it is safe to uh to have the
 
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
vaccination or uh another scenario is
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
the case that you just as I said
 
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
answered I think in terms of if it's
 
00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
just because the animal uh would die as
 
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
a result of the shot in that case you
 
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
just have to maintain those isolation
 
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.750 align:start position:0%
just have to maintain those isolation
procedures

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:27.299 align:start position:0%
rare I think the more common is if they
 
00:18:30.529 --> 00:18:30.539 align:start position:0%
are exempt because they've had
 
00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:33.140 align:start position:0%
a bad bad reaction
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
they the dog once they recover or the
 
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
cat may be fine
 
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
but because they're unvaccinated you
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
can't let them out
 
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
unless they're under your control
 
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
so you either have to be a house pet
 
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
which our little Yorkie is I mean she
 
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't even like to go outside she
 
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't know what green grass is she's
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
happy inside but like cats some cats
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
don't even like going outside so fine so
 
00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
they're exempt but every year we still
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
have to have the vet sign off on it
 
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
because there are maybe situations where
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
they recover or their immune system
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
changes and they're able to be
 
00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:18.950 align:start position:0%
changes and they're able to be
vaccinated

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
00:19:24.169 --> 00:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
um but that's I I think the norm is just
 
00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:27.299 align:start position:0%
that they're more like house pets
 
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
thank you sir thank you madam chair
 
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
00:19:30.179 --> 00:19:31.370 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
committee

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative coulon
 
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
oh yeah thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm just
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
wondering if you know by any chance how
 
00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:42.299 align:start position:0%
you guys qualified the animals on the
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
bill that says dogs cats and ferrets I'm
 
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
just wondering why
 
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059 align:start position:0%
um other animals were left out of the
 
00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:54.539 align:start position:0%
party like a guinea pig or a goat or
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
chinchilla or something like that well
 
00:19:59.330 --> 00:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
section one
 
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
uh which you don't see in the bill
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
because it's unchanged in the law and
 
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799 align:start position:0%
section one's been around a long time
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
and it says every dog cat and ferret
 
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
three months of age and older
 
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
I do not know
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
why it was limited to that
 
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
decades ago but that's the way it reads
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
so if you have a cow or a horse that's a
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
totally different
 
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
situation this is more
 
00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:31.559 align:start position:0%
the town Clerks
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
annually you know collect uh I don't
 
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
know 25 bucks or something to register
 
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
your pet
 
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.029 align:start position:0%
your pet
um

00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
I know when we lived in Beau our town
 
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
clerk every year knew we were going to
 
00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:48.539 align:start position:0%
be late because we had to get all these
 
00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
magic signatures
 
00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
and medulla Nayak said I wish the
 
00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
legislature would simplify this because
 
00:20:59.330 --> 00:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
the clerks have to babysit people who
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
need these exemptions
 
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
why chinchillas or other animals I I
 
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell you we're only
 
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
I think the reality is dogs and cats are
 
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
going to be the overwhelming yeah number
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
of pets that are involved here yeah
 
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you that's what I understand yeah
 
00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:23.820 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah I think
 
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
another aspect of that is that in terms
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
of uh roots of transmission uh
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
dogs and cats and ferrets are more
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
likely to bite I mean yes sheep can get
 
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
rabies but they're not you're unlikely
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
to be bitten by a rabid sheep whereas
 
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
the likelihood with with dogs cast and
 
00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
ferrets is higher
 
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.409 align:start position:0%
ferrets is higher
yeah

00:21:48.409 --> 00:21:48.419 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:52.740 align:start position:0%

legislative aide and we'll be
 
00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:15.539 align:start position:0%
introducing Senate bill 211. this bill
 
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
adds to the requirements for background
 
00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
investigations and criminal records
 
00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:21.539 align:start position:0%

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
waste facilities for permit applicants
 
00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
and this is relative as that of joe red
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
to background investigations of solid
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
waste and Hazardous Waste Facility
 
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
permit applicants Senator Pearl wanted
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
me to mention to the committee that Des
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
wanted the bill so Senator Pearl had
 
00:23:42.649 --> 00:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
this filed and there were some redrafts
 
00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
with language but eventually we settled
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
on the amended version that came out of
 
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
the Senate and that Des agreed to this
 
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
language as well as the stakeholders who
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
had some influence with this bill once
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
again unfortunately I won't be able to
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:02.340 align:start position:0%

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
questions so I will then now uh ask
 
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
director wimsat from nhdes to come up
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
and speak
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
um in support of this bill
 
00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair and members of
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record my name
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
is Mike Wimsatt my service director of
 
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services Waste Management
 
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
Division and I appreciate the
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come before you today to
 
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
testify on Senate bill 211. so uh as uh
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from Senator Pearl's
 
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
office indicated this is a this bill is
 
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
a request of New Hampshire Des
 
00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
um and we and we fully support the bill
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh so for many years New Hampshire law
 
00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
has required that applicants for both
 
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
solid waste and hazardous waste permits
 
00:24:58.570 --> 00:24:58.580 align:start position:0%
for facilities
 
00:25:00.529 --> 00:25:00.539 align:start position:0%
basically submit to a background
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
performance history check at the time of
 
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
their application and and the reason for
 
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
that is really to ensure that an
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
applicant who is seeking to run a solid
 
00:25:12.169 --> 00:25:12.179 align:start position:0%
or a hazardous waste facility has the
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
reliability expertise Integrity
 
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
competence to operate a facility and as
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
part of that in addition to Performance
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
history there is a requirement to do a
 
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
background check of criminal records
 
00:25:27.529 --> 00:25:27.539 align:start position:0%
background check of the key officers and
 
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
employees of the of the of the proposed
 
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
facility and one of the reasons for that
 
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
is that we are directed that uh we may
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
deny a permit to someone who is Seeking
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
a a house space or solid waste facility
 
00:25:42.649 --> 00:25:42.659 align:start position:0%
permit if they have been convicted of a
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
felony in the previous five years prior
 
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
to the application so the only way to
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
know that for sure
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
is to conduct a multi-state background
 
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
criminal investigation a records check
 
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
for those parties and so that has been
 
00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
done for a number of years but in just
 
00:25:59.690 --> 00:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
recently the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
Justice uh informed us that the language
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
and the statues which has been there for
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
decades in both the Hazardous race and
 
00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
the solid waste statute isn't properly
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
constructed to facilitate use of the
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
federal criminal background system so
 
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
the FBI basically the way that these
 
00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
background investigations are conducted
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
and and I would know they're conducted
 
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
in for many occupations uh people who
 
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
work in the schools uh bus drivers that
 
00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:27.419 align:start position:0%
sort of thing are all submitted to this
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
kind of a records check and it's pretty
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
commonly done pretty frequent it's done
 
00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
through the New Hampshire State Police
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
but as part of that and of course they
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
can do everything in state but for a
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
multi-state across the country
 
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:41.700 align:start position:0%
background investigation they go through
 
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
an FBI database the Federal Bureau of
 
00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
Investigations and the FBI is very
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
particular that if you're going to use
 
00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
that system the enabling language and
 
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
the statutes that enables you to do it
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be constructed in a very
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
particular way and doj is informed us
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
that our current statutes aren't
 
00:27:00.529 --> 00:27:00.539 align:start position:0%
constructed that way so we're seeking to
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
fix this and without this fix we will
 
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
not be able any longer to conduct uh
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
background criminal background
 
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
multi-state criminal background
 
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:09.900 align:start position:0%
investigations so this language would
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
accomplish that we work very closely
 
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
with doj to make sure we had the right
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
wording and we uh certainly uh support
 
00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
this and hope that you will find it uh
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
approvable uh and with that I'll leave
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
it and be happy to answer any questions
 
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.570 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:27:33.769 --> 00:27:33.779 align:start position:0%
director for taking my question just out
 
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
of curiosity
 
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.289 align:start position:0%
of curiosity
um

00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:36.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
have there been any issues with anyone
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
applying for these permits that we have
 
00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
found uh
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
a problem with in the past my and this
 
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
this precedes my time as director but my
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
understanding is there was one facility
 
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
a solid waste facility where one of the
 
00:27:57.529 --> 00:27:57.539 align:start position:0%
key officers had indeed been convicted
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
of a felony in the previous five years
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
and they were informed that that would
 
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
not that that permit would not issue
 
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
with that person in in in in leadership
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
in the company and as a result that
 
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
permit did not issue
 
00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
so director wimsat this is let me just
 
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
restate and say that so this change to
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
statute just brings our language into
 
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
line with what's required with
 
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
um FBI background checks that's correct
 
00:28:36.649 --> 00:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
that's interesting so it's really more
 
00:28:39.649 --> 00:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
it's a it's housekeeping but
 
00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
um in a manner which complies with
 
00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:45.179 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:48.900 align:start position:0%
that's fair statement okay thank you
 
00:28:51.409 --> 00:28:51.419 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions
 
00:28:51.419 --> 00:28:52.130 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions
um

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
I'd like the anyone else wish to speak
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to Blue sheet for this
 
00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.909 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to Blue sheet for this
please

00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:00.919 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
and there has been no comments online
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
thank you and we have uh Senator Pearl
 
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh registered Pro support for this bill
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
on the blue sheet with that I'm going to
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
close out the hearing for sb211
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
and we are just a minute shy of our 9 30
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
for SB 23 and I want to bring to the
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
attention of the committee
 
00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:46.669 align:start position:0%
attention of the committee
um

00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:50.169 --> 00:29:50.179 align:start position:0%
I received back from our house Clerk
 
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
a senate message
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
for a bill that we had HB 152 having to
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
do with soil and plant additives
 
00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:02.930 align:start position:0%
do with soil and plant additives
um

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
and that bill came back with an
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
amendment from the Senate which we are
 
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
asked whether we are going to concur or
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
non-concur with this change
 
00:30:16.559 --> 00:30:17.810 align:start position:0%
non-concur with this change
um

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
I believe I discussed this with uh
 
00:30:24.169 --> 00:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
Senator Bixby and and I'm sorry
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
represent I'm getting ahead of myself
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
here representative Bixby I'm getting my
 
00:30:30.889 --> 00:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
senators and representatives all mixed
 
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
up today
 
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
um but uh apparently they they changed
 
00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
some wording in here uh regarding the
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
purchase of uh fertilizer
 
00:30:45.049 --> 00:30:45.059 align:start position:0%
um the the statement is penalty payments
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
received from the registrant she'll be
 
00:30:48.649 --> 00:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
refunded to the consumer of the
 
00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
fertilizer which has been analyzed and
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
found efficient provided that the
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
purchase is of one half ton or more as
 
00:30:59.950 --> 00:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
I would love you to speak to that
 
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
um and I believe that the committee
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
should concur with this change but go
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
ahead so um when I brought this uh
 
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
before the the senate committee
 
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
um Senator Pearl noted that he had the
 
00:31:21.889 --> 00:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
experience in term uh with uh as a
 
00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
fertilizer dealer and noted that a
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
deficiency in uh of of less than half a
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
ton would uh could add up to a matter of
 
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
a sense or maybe a few dollars and that
 
00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
uh the paperwork burdened to the
 
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
department for uh dealing with a number
 
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
of a very large number of very small
 
00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
fines uh could uh outweigh the benefit
 
00:31:54.049 --> 00:31:54.059 align:start position:0%
that uh would be received that would be
 
00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
gained by that so
 
00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:57.070 align:start position:0%
gained by that so
um

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:00.020 align:start position:0%
uh he he said that he would be fine
 
00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
dropping it from a full-time which is
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
what current law has to a half ton but
 
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
uh dropping it down to you know for any
 
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
amount would uh could create a paperwork
 
00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
burden that outweighed the benefit and I
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
said that I was fine with that uh would
 
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
that change so I think that we should
 
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
concur with this
 
00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:22.850 align:start position:0%
concur with this
um

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
and uh so that that's my my feeling on
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
it okay just by a show of hands are we
 
00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
all okay with concurring with this
 
00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.130 align:start position:0%
all okay with concurring with this
change

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:31.140 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much committee I
 
00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
will now open up um SB 23 which is
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
establishing a study committee on meat
 
00:32:41.039 --> 00:32:42.430 align:start position:0%
establishing a study committee on meat
processing

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
processing
 
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.330 align:start position:0%
processing
and

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.169 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:32:45.169 --> 00:32:45.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
who I have for this speaking I I guess
 
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
is uh Senator Innis
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.169 --> 00:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
Dan Ennis from Bradford New Hampshire
 
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
representing District Seven good morning
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
Madam chair members of the committee for
 
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
giving me my allergies are acting up I'm
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
mildly medicated so speak slowly uh but
 
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
I think we'll be all right
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
um it's the unfairness of spring in New
 
00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.769 align:start position:0%
um it's the unfairness of spring in New
Hampshire

00:33:15.769 --> 00:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
um but it's all good
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
um this bill is being brought forward
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
um to you uh Senate bill 23.
 
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.830 align:start position:0%
um to you uh Senate bill 23.
um

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.850 align:start position:0%
um
okay

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
in part
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
um well in whole
 
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
um because I've learned a lot in the
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
last couple of years about farming in
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
our state and getting things from Farm
 
00:33:38.409 --> 00:33:38.419 align:start position:0%
to Table and some of the difficulties
 
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
that exist in doing so for small farmers
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
and this bill simply establishes a study
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
committee to start to take a look at
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
this particular issue and consider how
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
we might perhaps be able to make things
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit easier for small farmers
 
00:33:57.769 --> 00:33:57.779 align:start position:0%
around our state and this one focuses on
 
00:33:59.810 --> 00:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
what we call non-amenable species so
 
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
this isn't typical cattle or chickens
 
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
but rather would be bison deer elk and
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing and we do have some
 
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
bison farmers in our state there's one
 
00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:11.300 align:start position:0%
in Warner that I'm very familiar with
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
there's an elk farmer in Lee New
 
00:34:15.649 --> 00:34:15.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and some others around the
 
00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:16.570 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and some others around the
place

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:16.580 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:19.859 align:start position:0%
and this sets up a study commission that
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
that consists of members of the the
 
00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:23.899 align:start position:0%
Senate and the house
 
00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:27.179 align:start position:0%
and we'll begin to dive into this issue
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper is here to speak to
 
00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
to it as well and provide a little more
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
insight but the the objective here is to
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
consider how we might be able well to
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
understand the current situation but
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
then to consider how we might be able to
 
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
make things a little bit easier for
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
those small farmers there is one thing
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
about the bill that I think maybe we
 
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
need to adjust and that's in line 31 of
 
00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment actually
 
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
and we have a completion date of
 
00:34:56.329 --> 00:34:56.339 align:start position:0%
November 1st 2023 that may be too
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
aggressive as I think about it and maybe
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
June 30th of 24 would be a a wiser way
 
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
to go with that
 
00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.030 align:start position:0%
to go with that
um

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to take any questions and I
 
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
know the commissioner can answer
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
questions in probably greater detail
 
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
than I
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Innis any questions
 
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
for Senator Ennis
 
00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:22.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.810 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:24.710 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:26.329 --> 00:35:26.339 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh you may be aware that there's a
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
certain reluctance on the part of house
 
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
leadership to take on a lot of study
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
committees yes and one of the issues is
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
that the burden typically falls on the
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
house to field most of the members of
 
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
the committee how would you feel about
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
sharing the weight equally and having
 
00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:52.740 align:start position:0%
two senators and two reps on the
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
committee rather than one and three
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question and I would
 
00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
be delighted actually I know of a
 
00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
senator who'd be perfect for this okay
 
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
so yes thank you thank you
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
okay then
 
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
all right that's an amendment then uh
 
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
that we would be happy to uh
 
00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:16.619 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that representative um and
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
along with that Amendment so you are
 
00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
also suggesting that the um the report
 
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
that's produced should have a due date
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
of June 30th 2024. yes please I think
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
that's reasonable and it gives us enough
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
time to adequately study this okay okay
 
00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair Senator
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
ideally what would you envision that
 
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
committees report
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations I mean if you
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
what what would this commit at the end
 
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:51.300 align:start position:0%
of the day ideally what would they
 
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.030 align:start position:0%
of the day ideally what would they
produce

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
produce
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
they will produce recommendations on
 
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
ways to streamline the process for small
 
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
farmers to ensure that public health is
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
protected right that's important
 
00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:05.220 align:start position:0%
um but in many cases
 
00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.130 align:start position:0%
um but in many cases
um

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
it's it's a little too difficult to get
 
00:37:11.089 --> 00:37:11.099 align:start position:0%
things done and and you'll hear from the
 
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
commissioner in his testimony
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
how it works and and why it can be a
 
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
little bit difficult but you know
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
um I think focusing on the non amenable
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
species to start is a good way to move
 
00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:26.339 align:start position:0%
into this and in the ideal World in a
 
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
year or two
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
um we start looking at other options
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a and you know the
 
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:34.740 align:start position:0%
commissioner can speak to this too if
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
you produce meat birds for example to
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
sell it can be difficult
 
00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
um to get those to Market unless you use
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
a USDA facility and there are some
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
issues in getting time at those
 
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
facilities sometimes that are distance
 
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
away and quite frankly what's important
 
00:37:52.609 --> 00:37:52.619 align:start position:0%
to many of the small farmers in New
 
00:37:55.849 --> 00:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire be included is that animals be
 
00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
treated humanely and you know if you can
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
avoid major processing plants where
 
00:38:02.089 --> 00:38:02.099 align:start position:0%
there's more likely to be disease and
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
find another way I think that makes
 
00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
sense and it will help our small farms
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
to be more productive I could sell a
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
chicken to you from my farm store but I
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
can't sell it to a retailer same bird
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
unless it goes through that USDA
 
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
facility so that's the objective here
 
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
let's help our Farmers while we're
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
protecting the public health make it
 
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
easier to get to Market in the longer
 
00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
term it will take time to do this and
 
00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
maybe I'll run into a wall and that's
 
00:38:32.329 --> 00:38:32.339 align:start position:0%
okay you know but I think it it's
 
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
something we need to explore for our
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
farmers in our small communities around
 
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
the state it's a tough It's A Hard
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
Scrabble business in New Hampshire no no
 
00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:41.700 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of them in our districts
 
00:38:43.849 --> 00:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
yeah I understand yeah I grew up in Ohio
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
where you put a disc in the soil and
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
plant a seed it grows not so much here
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
so we have to be a little more creative
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
and I think anything we can do to smooth
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
the process is helpful thank you great
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murray
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
Madam chair for taking my question
 
00:38:59.810 --> 00:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
um so one of the questions that I didn't
 
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
have was
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you one of the things that I was
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
just about is the scope of the studying
 
00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
committee and and looking at you
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned obviously public health
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
component and then you mentioned things
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
like the USDA access to USDA or avenues
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
that way but are you also looking at
 
00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
educational components to like getting
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
new folks into that
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
that's not specifically in the amendment
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
or the bill
 
00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:26.700 align:start position:0%
um but I don't see anything wrong with
 
00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:31.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
representative coulon
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
um I was just curious if maybe a study
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
commission like this could lead to some
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
sort of um you know voluntary labeling
 
00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
system like New Hampshire grown or
 
00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
something easier to identify food yeah
 
00:39:56.089 --> 00:39:56.099 align:start position:0%
you know produce in New Hampshire by
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
small farmers I think it certainly could
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
yes awesome well we just had breakfast
 
00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:05.099 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire uh young Farmers
 
00:40:07.609 --> 00:40:07.619 align:start position:0%
Coalition so good I'm glad to know there
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
are a few young Farmers out there yeah
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm I'm new to the business but
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's a lot of fun and I think it's
 
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
it's it would be great for our state to
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
continue to maintain our small farms
 
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you the part of our
 
00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
culture honestly
 
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative dutzy
 
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you thank you madam chair
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so just
 
00:40:31.609 --> 00:40:31.619 align:start position:0%
to clarify and I apologize for my
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
ignorance but so if uh so right now if I
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
shoot a deer I can have it butchered for
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
my consumption is that correct that's my
 
00:40:44.089 --> 00:40:44.099 align:start position:0%
understanding yes but if I want to sell
 
00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
it then we have to go through the
 
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
existing process USDA and we know that
 
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
that's all backed up is that pretty much
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
where we're at I'll let the commissioner
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
give you the details on that I think
 
00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
he's better able to speak to the details
 
00:40:58.970 --> 00:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
of deer than I yeah thank you yeah
 
00:41:01.609 --> 00:41:01.619 align:start position:0%
raising deer on a farm not not I know
 
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
some folks do it but I think less common
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Ennis thank you
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate it good to see you
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
I call now uh uh commissioner Sean
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
Jasper from the Department of
 
00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:25.970 align:start position:0%
Jasper from the Department of
Agriculture

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman members of the
 
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
commissioner members of the committee I
 
00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
am still the commissioner
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
tongue tied
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
um so I am in favor of Senate bill 23. I
 
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
I will say though in terms of the
 
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
creation of the state Meat Inspection uh
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
program which we have on the books that
 
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
is still something we support
 
00:42:01.849 --> 00:42:01.859 align:start position:0%
eliminating because it just has no
 
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
potential to survive without extensive
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh State funding I don't see that
 
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
happening and that would not be my top
 
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
priority for the Department anyhow
 
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
however I think there is a lot of value
 
00:42:19.089 --> 00:42:19.099 align:start position:0%
at looking at the non-emanable
 
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
processing question
 
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
um and I really believe that that is
 
00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
about traceability and clear labeling
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
for the consumers
 
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
I think if people choose to buy those
 
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
non-eemenable uh products in there know
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
that they're not USDA inspected and and
 
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
that they know where the product comes
 
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
from that is something they should have
 
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
have the right to do
 
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
um and that's really because that is not
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
under Federal jurisdiction the feds have
 
00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
left that out so say well why not extend
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
that to all other species because we
 
00:42:57.599 --> 00:42:58.430 align:start position:0%
that to all other species because we
can't

00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
so you know that's the simple answer but
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
it in answer to your question yes if you
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
wish to sell deer meat
 
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
um to the public it would have to go
 
00:43:11.329 --> 00:43:11.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to answer any questions
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for um
 
00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:18.839 align:start position:0%
answering the question
 
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
um this this weekend I met with some
 
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:23.220 align:start position:0%
Farmers from Massachusetts who um we
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
were talking about Slaughter and they
 
00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
were they said that the USDA um
 
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh slaughterhouses down there were sort
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
of too expensive for the smaller farms
 
00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:35.220 align:start position:0%
and that there was they still have state
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
inspection in Massachusetts from what
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
from what they told me
 
00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
um for and so the smaller farmers were
 
00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:41.150 align:start position:0%
um for and so the smaller farmers were
bringing

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
bringing
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
were had sort of egregious terms set by
 
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
the state to to do smaller loads
 
00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:48.530 align:start position:0%
the state to to do smaller loads
um

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
and I have to say that I'm I'm puzzled
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
by that I haven't received any evidence
 
00:43:56.349 --> 00:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
of that because the federal laws require
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
the exact same standards
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
at a minimum for a state program as
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
exists for USDA inspection so I'm not
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
sure how that that would work because
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
you would still have to have a state
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
inspector there of course you know
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
everybody else talks about oh well Maine
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
does this Massachusetts does this
 
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
Vermont does that they have his sales
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
and income tax
 
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
and so they throw a lot of money at a
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
lot of things that we don't have money
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
to throw at but the standards are the
 
00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.190 align:start position:0%
to throw at but the standards are the
same

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:28.790 align:start position:0%
same
um

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
what we have done here through the use
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
of Opera funds and next Wednesday we
 
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
should be finally awarding the uh the
 
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
grants we did have
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh 750 000 going out to various
 
00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:47.460 align:start position:0%
processors in the state to expand or
 
00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
modify their facilities there's a lot of
 
00:44:53.089 --> 00:44:53.099 align:start position:0%
good things going on in the processing
 
00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
we expect it to become more available to
 
00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
the farm
 
00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh to the small farmers not only that
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
working with Cooperative Extension will
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
be standing up a
 
00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
mobile class partially online partially
 
00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
on site so that people who are
 
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
interested in learning those skills will
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to do that which
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
should also help with the availability
 
00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
but there is this false narrative at
 
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
least from what I've seen that oh yeah
 
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
we need a state inspection program
 
00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:25.859 align:start position:0%
because it won't be as as rigid won't be
 
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
as expensive I just simply don't know
 
00:45:32.569 --> 00:45:32.579 align:start position:0%
how that that is possible and the only
 
00:45:35.329 --> 00:45:35.339 align:start position:0%
thing I can say is that if you had a
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
state program and you had a few small
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
processes perhaps they send their
 
00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
inspectors here one day here one day and
 
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
those processors might only be open a
 
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
day or two a week and that's a shared
 
00:45:50.329 --> 00:45:50.339 align:start position:0%
resource but the way our program is is
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
set up would be more expensive because
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh the people having the animals
 
00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
slaughtered at a state program would
 
00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
have to pay
 
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
for the full costs of that inspection
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
whereas well I shouldn't say a full full
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
cost I'd have to pay for half cost feds
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
would still pay for half
 
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
but as it is now they're not paying for
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
the federal part of the inspection so
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
um that's not a path unless the
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
legislature said hey we've we've got a
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
million million and a half dollars we
 
00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
don't know what to do with let's put it
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
into a state Meat Inspection program
 
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
I don't think that day will ever come it
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
hasn't arrived and I started hanging
 
00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
around here in 1984 and haven't seen
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby yeah
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
could you just
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
um go over what the current
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
um procedure is for dealing with not
 
00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
MediCal animals so yeah for for an elk
 
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
Farmer for deer Farmer for a bison
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
farmer what do they do now in order to
 
00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
be able to sell their meat other than
 
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
from a Farm Stand
 
00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:01.740 align:start position:0%
well even from a Farm Stand if they are
 
00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:03.290 align:start position:0%
well even from a Farm Stand if they are
not

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.730 align:start position:0%
not
um

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:06.290 align:start position:0%
um
going

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:07.670 align:start position:0%
going
through

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
the USDA inspection
 
00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
and some some facilities will deal with
 
00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
those but some don't want to deal with
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
with a bison
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
the difficulty of those un Untamed
 
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
animals going through that process some
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
won't deal with it
 
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:29.300 align:start position:0%
so there has been nobody who has legally
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
done any of that at this point because
 
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
you have to have a veterinarian on site
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
to inspect the animal
 
00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
pre-mortem and post-mortem there has to
 
00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
be lab testing there has to be you know
 
00:47:47.329 --> 00:47:47.339 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that are supposed to
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
happen I don't have them memorized
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
because they've never happened and
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
nobody's ever requested we did
 
00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
find out that there were sales
 
00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:57.770 align:start position:0%
find out that there were sales
um

00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:01.140 align:start position:0%
of Bison uh I don't know if it was bison
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter abnormenable species out
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
there that had not gone through the
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
process and that's when it was looking
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
looked to be expanded to Elk like during
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
the last legislative session said see
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
there's been no problem with the program
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
we have now when we looked at it and
 
00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
said well gee there's been no problem
 
00:48:21.530 --> 00:48:21.540 align:start position:0%
with it because nobody's actually done
 
00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
it correctly
 
00:48:22.859 --> 00:48:24.170 align:start position:0%
it correctly
so

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:24.829 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:24.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
there is no no shortcut and even those
 
00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
who have large herds have said it just
 
00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
simply too expensive to do it the way
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
so uh so the the Farms that are doing
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
elk and deer are having those animals
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
processed at USDA facilities they would
 
00:48:50.809 --> 00:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
they would have to yes in order to
 
00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
legally sell them and they are and uh
 
00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
for uh they are
 
00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.690 align:start position:0%
for uh they are
um

00:48:59.690 --> 00:48:59.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh where was that going with this um so
 
00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:05.870 align:start position:0%
uh where was that going with this um so
um

00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
do they have more difficulty getting
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
their animals to slaughter facilities
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
than uh someone who is doing a minimal
 
00:49:17.089 --> 00:49:17.099 align:start position:0%
amenable animals
 
00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of schedule that I I wouldn't
 
00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
know I think that would depend on the
 
00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:23.450 align:start position:0%
know I think that would depend on the
facility

00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
um I you know I do know I went to a
 
00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:28.140 align:start position:0%
small processor so let me be clear if I
 
00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:30.260 align:start position:0%
wasn't you don't have to have the animal
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
fully processed at a USDA inspected
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
facility has to be slotted there so you
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
can have it slaughtered there
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
and then taken back to your
 
00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
non-inspected facility you can still
 
00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
then sell it from a store from anywhere
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
as long as it was slaughtered at a
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
facility I and
 
00:49:53.569 --> 00:49:53.579 align:start position:0%
um I don't know the difficulty if
 
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
they're having any more difficulty or
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
not I would suspect probably for alka
 
00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
bison probably not for Elk or deer
 
00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
probably not for bison as I said
 
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
um those are very large and wild animals
 
00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
and I think they would be having much
 
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
more difficulty getting somebody to deal
 
00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
with that since their Slaughter dates
 
00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:16.140 align:start position:0%
are generally full anyhow
 
00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair for taking my
 
00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:20.690 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair for taking my
question

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
um thank you commissioner
 
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
um so one of the questions that I had
 
00:50:25.609 --> 00:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
was whether or not the study committee
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
might take a look at those non-amenable
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
species that we know were being imported
 
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:32.339 align:start position:0%
for sale in New Hampshire from other
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
states and I Know It Grocers uh I have
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
seen some of these non-amentable species
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
on the shelf for sale but they're coming
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
from outside of New Hampshire so I'm
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
curious to know what impact that has uh
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
you're telling me something I I didn't
 
00:50:48.049 --> 00:50:48.059 align:start position:0%
know about so I really can't
 
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
answer it I I would
 
00:50:53.569 --> 00:50:53.579 align:start position:0%
suspect they still have to be inspected
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
for the USDA facility and I would hope
 
00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
that there is traceability I mean where
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
that has become a huge issue with all
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
food products these days so uh certainly
 
00:51:05.569 --> 00:51:05.579 align:start position:0%
something they could look at but I don't
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
for the commissioner
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
um so it seems we've
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
heard for this particular Bill a
 
00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:28.940 align:start position:0%
possible Amendment
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
to be added not only to change the date
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
of the report but also to change the
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
composition of the committee to be two
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
members of the house and two members of
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.890 align:start position:0%
the Senate
representative

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:51:44.809 --> 00:51:44.819 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:51:44.819 --> 00:51:46.130 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
and although I like the idea of two and
 
00:51:50.569 --> 00:51:50.579 align:start position:0%
two I think we should leave it at three
 
00:51:52.849 --> 00:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
reps and two senators just to make sure
 
00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
we have a quorum
 
00:51:58.370 --> 00:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:00.049 --> 00:52:00.059 align:start position:0%
um anybody else have any thoughts on
 
00:52:00.059 --> 00:52:05.349 align:start position:0%
um anybody else have any thoughts on
that

00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh it was three members of the house and
 
00:52:11.569 --> 00:52:11.579 align:start position:0%
one member of the Senate yeah uh we
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
might want to make it three and two
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
give it given that and with a quorum of
 
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
three yeah and just just because
 
00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
um those of us who have worked on study
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
committees in the past have noticed uh
 
00:52:28.609 --> 00:52:28.619 align:start position:0%
an inconsistency on the part of the
 
00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:31.140 align:start position:0%
members across the wall and made able to
 
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at three
 
00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
representatives and two senators I think
 
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
if if you think the you might want to
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
consult also with the speaker to make
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
sure that that would be amenable to him
 
00:52:52.609 --> 00:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
as it were uh but
 
00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
um but uh that you know it might be
 
00:53:00.109 --> 00:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:02.089 --> 00:53:02.099 align:start position:0%
okay so that's that would be for
 
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
purposes of a quorum of three right okay
 
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.049 --> 00:53:14.059 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
let me uh I will work on an amendment
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
for that then but I will speak to the
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
house speaker for that
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
um and so far as hb20 SB 23 the blue
 
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
sheet we had one person sign in
 
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:30.290 align:start position:0%
sheet we had one person sign in
favor

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
favor
 
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.069 align:start position:0%
favor
um

00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
and no one online
 
00:53:36.049 --> 00:53:36.059 align:start position:0%
so I'll pass it on to our Clerk
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
and I will close the hearing for SB 23
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
our next bill is coming up at 10 15 so
 
00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:48.140 align:start position:0%
we'll take a short break
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
unless is there anything the committee
 
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
would like to discuss at this point
 
00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:53.990 align:start position:0%
would like to discuss at this point
before

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
we take a short recess
 
00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
I need to change that but it's it you'll
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
never get a senator to show up hardly
 
00:54:40.319 --> 00:54:41.329 align:start position:0%
never get a senator to show up hardly
ever

00:54:41.329 --> 00:54:41.339 align:start position:0%
ever
 
00:54:41.339 --> 00:54:43.250 align:start position:0%
ever
false

00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
false
 
00:54:43.260 --> 00:55:48.950 align:start position:0%
false
um

thank you thank you for having me
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and Ladies and
 
01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
Gentlemen of the committee for the
 
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
record I am Senator Donovan Fenton I
 
01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
represent District 10.
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh Senate Bill 159's purpose is to study
 
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
the department environmental services
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
issuing any future unlimited service
 
01:16:31.010 --> 01:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
area landfill permits and to study the
 
01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
out-of-state waste coming into New
 
01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.490 align:start position:0%
out-of-state waste coming into New
Hampshire

01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
we are seeing New Hampshire Soul become
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
a Dumping Ground for trash from other
 
01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.590 align:start position:0%
a Dumping Ground for trash from other
states

01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
a report from the environmental
 
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
environment Department published in
 
01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
November shows that more than 45 percent
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
of the trash coming to our landfill
 
01:16:50.209 --> 01:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
comes from out of state sources
 
01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has not built a landfill
 
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
in 30 years because it seems like their
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste plan is to dump it in New
 
01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.189 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste plan is to dump it in New
Hampshire

01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
Maine pass legislation prohibiting the
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
disposal of out-of-state waste in the
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
state's landfill Vermont has also
 
01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
established aggressive standards for
 
01:17:08.570 --> 01:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
what can be disposed of in its landfills
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
at the rate we are going it might not be
 
01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:12.060 align:start position:0%
long before we are seeing barges coming
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
into Portsmouth from South Carolina with
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
their trash
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire recently updated its Solid
 
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
Waste Management plan with its goals to
 
01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
reduce in-state waste and trash toxicity
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
it's a great strategy like Recycling and
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
composting but it fails to address the
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
problem that almost half of our waste
 
01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
comes from out of state trash
 
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
I urge the members of the committee to
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
consider this bill
 
01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
um and if you have any questions I'd be
 
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them questions from the
 
01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.890 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them questions from the
committee

01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:43.910 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
so

01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
um one uh we currently have have a solid
 
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
waste working group and I'm wondering uh
 
01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
why it would be better to do this as a
 
01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
separate study committee rather than
 
01:17:58.970 --> 01:17:58.980 align:start position:0%
having this uh be covered by the saw uh
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group absolutely
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think if
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's in the solid uh waste working
 
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
groups uh bylaws or statutory laws I
 
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
think it's a it can be covered under
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
that the issue that was brought up with
 
01:18:16.729 --> 01:18:16.739 align:start position:0%
this is that out-of-state trash is not
 
01:18:18.189 --> 01:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
being addressed
 
01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
and where in other states are
 
01:18:24.410 --> 01:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
phasing out building landfills it looks
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
like there may be landfills in our
 
01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.530 align:start position:0%
like there may be landfills in our
future

01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
um I think Vermont has one landfill
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
whereas New Hampshire is debating on
 
01:18:35.689 --> 01:18:35.699 align:start position:0%
potentially more and what we need to do
 
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
as a status figure out how do we stop uh
 
01:18:39.790 --> 01:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
single waste pollution and also stop
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
trash coming from out of state that's
 
01:18:43.729 --> 01:18:43.739 align:start position:0%
that's the Crux of the issue is the
 
01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
trash is coming from out of state
 
01:18:48.649 --> 01:18:48.659 align:start position:0%
uh representative Murray uh thank you
 
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair for the question thank you
 
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
senator for the question
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
in the event that the
 
01:18:59.330 --> 01:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
are you also seeking input from folks
 
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
who may be able to weigh in on
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce clause and uh those
 
01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
types of things that might
 
01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
come under the purview of this
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
discussion having served on a study
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
committee regarding this I just it's a
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
great question I think that's the
 
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
elephant in the room right the Commerce
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
Clause how do we get around that and I
 
01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
would say that um you know
 
01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
it's up uh studying that issue in and of
 
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
itself is a whole other thing but it is
 
01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
a I I would welcome individuals who are
 
01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:30.590 align:start position:0%
a I I would welcome individuals who are
um

01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:32.330 --> 01:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
understand the interstate commerce
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
clause and deal with it daily uh to
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
testify or speak in front of that
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
committee I think
 
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
um it's not up for us to determine the
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
out-of-state Commerce closet signed up
 
01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
for Des either to discernment what is uh
 
01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
what does and does not pass that out of
 
01:19:51.770 --> 01:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative germana
 
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
01:19:58.270 --> 01:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh thinking about
 
01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
what virtue a study committee might have
 
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
would one of the benefits of of a study
 
01:20:07.370 --> 01:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
committee perhaps be that when a
 
01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
report is is concluded in November that
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
you have a group of legislators who may
 
01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
already be in a position to put forward
 
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
some legislation uh hopefully bipartisan
 
01:20:21.410 --> 01:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
legislation House and Senate legislation
 
01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
so is that potentially a benefit of
 
01:20:25.729 --> 01:20:25.739 align:start position:0%
doing it as a study committee as opposed
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
to going to the working group
 
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question I think that is
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
um a great point you know the whole
 
01:20:34.610 --> 01:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
purpose of this is uh how long can we
 
01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
wait you know we're at 45 trash from out
 
01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
of state is it going to go up to 50 is
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
it going to go up to 55 uh where does it
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
end and if we don't address it now
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
when's too late
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator thank you madam chair
 
01:20:50.209 --> 01:20:50.219 align:start position:0%
Senator have you spoken to
 
01:20:52.010 --> 01:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
01:20:54.410 --> 01:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
she is chair of the solid waste working
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
group have you spoken to her about this
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
we haven't spoke thank you for the
 
01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
question Madam chair we have spoken um
 
01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
there there is some overlap
 
01:21:04.850 --> 01:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
um we haven't seen the address of
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
out-of-state trash
 
01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
being necessarily addressed sorry that
 
01:21:10.910 --> 01:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
was a double words there um but
 
01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
as representative germana said it's
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
really to get something out by hopefully
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
next legislative session
 
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
okay because I'm also a member of solid
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
waste working group and I know there are
 
01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
various issues and topics that
 
01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
um that they are covering and I believe
 
01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
that this is one that is going to be on
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
their list of things to look at
 
01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:39.260 align:start position:0%
um so I I'm I'm just hesitant in
 
01:21:42.050 --> 01:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
duplicating work thank you madam chair
 
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely I'd be hesitant to
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
duplicate work as well I think um if
 
01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
that is the subject you're covering and
 
01:21:50.689 --> 01:21:50.699 align:start position:0%
you are going to get to it I think then
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know it would uh you wouldn't
 
01:21:54.649 --> 01:21:54.659 align:start position:0%
want to wait
 
01:21:56.930 --> 01:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
01:21:58.490 --> 01:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
chair for taking my question
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
um senator
 
01:22:02.930 --> 01:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
I think to get to the point of of your
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
specific piece of legislation you're
 
01:22:06.169 --> 01:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
looking at unlimited service areas
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
versus areas where there are limited
 
01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
service area landfills is that correct
 
01:22:11.930 --> 01:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
so you would not be looking at that
 
01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:13.490 align:start position:0%
so you would not be looking at that
other

01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
correct group thank you for the question
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
correct so we're not looking at limited
 
01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
service areas we're looking at unlimited
 
01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
service areas which accept trash from
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.169 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:22:27.169 --> 01:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
um could could you explain a little bit
 
01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
more about how the permitting works for
 
01:22:39.050 --> 01:22:39.060 align:start position:0%
a limited area Service uh limited
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
service area
 
01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:41.450 align:start position:0%
service area
um

01:22:41.450 --> 01:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
facility versus an unlimited service
 
01:22:46.370 --> 01:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
area and what how did
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
um how does uh
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
how is he determined whether the permit
 
01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
would be limited area or unlimited area
 
01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I will
 
01:22:59.149 --> 01:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
describe it as best as I understand it
 
01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
um a limited service area would be like
 
01:23:05.090 --> 01:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
uh your county or specific to towns
 
01:23:07.130 --> 01:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
things of that nature a certain
 
01:23:09.770 --> 01:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
demographic area geographical area uh
 
01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
whereas an unlimited service area the
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
way I understand there's really no
 
01:23:16.610 --> 01:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
parameters except potentially what type
 
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
of trash you can take that's the way I
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
understand it so you can get trash from
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
Vermont Massachusetts Maine uh Iowa you
 
01:23:30.649 --> 01:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:42.169 --> 01:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
there is might be town or Municipal
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
level who receive only within that
 
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction correct thank you
 
01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
the way I understand it representative
 
01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah so is the are the limits on
 
01:23:59.450 --> 01:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
the service area determined by uh who
 
01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
owns the landfill or is it and so for
 
01:24:04.729 --> 01:24:04.739 align:start position:0%
instance with Nashua Nash the city of
 
01:24:06.649 --> 01:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
Nashua owns the landfill so they can
 
01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
choose their service area uh but
 
01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:11.590 align:start position:0%
choose their service area uh but
um

01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
with uh say with uh TurnKey in in
 
01:24:18.290 --> 01:24:18.300 align:start position:0%
Rochester that's owned by waste
 
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
management and
 
01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that there's a matter of
 
01:24:23.930 --> 01:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
the permit saying what the service area
 
01:24:27.770 --> 01:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
is it's a matter of that of of turn of
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
Waste Management
 
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
um accepting uh trash from clients
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
wherever they find them so
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative I think I understand your
 
01:24:36.719 --> 01:24:38.870 align:start position:0%
representative I think I understand your
question

01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:24:40.850 --> 01:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
um yes it determines there's a lot of
 
01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
determining factors of what area you
 
01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
service and what trash you take in I
 
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
think it deals with uh municipalities
 
01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
determining that and also the
 
01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
application process in which they're
 
01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
applying for Des as well to determine
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
what they're graded for I'm sure Des is
 
01:25:00.649 --> 01:25:00.659 align:start position:0%
behind me chomping at the bit to correct
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
me on some of these so uh you'll get
 
01:25:05.149 --> 01:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
another chance at this
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Senator
 
01:25:13.970 --> 01:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if this applies to the
 
01:25:16.370 --> 01:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce laws but given that
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
some of these landfills are meant to be
 
01:25:21.290 --> 01:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
profitable and the permitting of it
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
probably includes ways to be profitable
 
01:25:27.169 --> 01:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
including taking trash from out of state
 
01:25:27.179 --> 01:25:29.750 align:start position:0%
including taking trash from out of state
where

01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
what would you like to see the committee
 
01:25:36.110 --> 01:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
conclude regarding Commerce
 
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question in regard to
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
Commerce I think um you know I think we
 
01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
all want a
 
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
cleaner New Hampshire
 
01:25:46.729 --> 01:25:46.739 align:start position:0%
um and I think uh if you're not upset
 
01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
that you know 45 of our trash comes from
 
01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
out of state uh you know there's an
 
01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
issue there um you know we're not trying
 
01:25:56.450 --> 01:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
to hamper business by any means but
 
01:25:58.129 --> 01:25:58.139 align:start position:0%
we're also not in the business of
 
01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
becoming the trash state to accept other
 
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
to to connect with representative
 
01:26:13.129 --> 01:26:13.139 align:start position:0%
Howard's question is also I believe and
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong uh a question
 
01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
here in terms of our landfill capacity
 
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
and increased costs for New Hampshire
 
01:26:20.570 --> 01:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
residents right I mean if you have a
 
01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
landfill that's closer to you and it is
 
01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
filling up with almost half of the trash
 
01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
being uh brought in from out of state
 
01:26:29.090 --> 01:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
and then the result is ultimately that
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
your own local trash then has to be
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
shipped further you're talking about
 
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
tipping fees going up and increased cost
 
01:26:36.649 --> 01:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire residents
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
to ship our garbage because we can't
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
handle it in a local landfill it's
 
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
taking a lot of out-of-state trash
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
if I understand yes there's a cost
 
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
question there's a cost to everything uh
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
in the long run it's going to cost the
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire a lot more
 
01:26:52.970 --> 01:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
money and uh maybe the quality of our
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
our state air trash like that we're also
 
01:26:58.189 --> 01:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
seeing uh you know garbage trucks
 
01:26:59.570 --> 01:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
literally just driving up from
 
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh there's no there's no
 
01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
special transportation of this trash
 
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:04.980 align:start position:0%
it's literally just dump trucks getting
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
on our highways driving up to us and
 
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
dumping their trash you want to talk
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
about about an environment on top of
 
01:27:11.689 --> 01:27:11.699 align:start position:0%
that uh you know those trucks don't get
 
01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
great gas mileage so you know it's uh
 
01:27:16.010 --> 01:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
cheaper for them to do that than it is
 
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
for them to figure out the problems
 
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Senator
 
01:27:26.090 --> 01:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
would you say then that it is a
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
permitting question would you like to
 
01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
see the permitting of our landfills be
 
01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
more restrictive
 
01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think uh
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
that's why we have a study committee I I
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
we can find a solution in here somewhere
 
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
um I think we're all in agreeance that
 
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
we want to do something here uh dealing
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
with out-of-state trash and if that is a
 
01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
permitting process if it's a new
 
01:27:57.490 --> 01:27:57.500 align:start position:0%
language in terms of how we approach
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste or out of state waste I
 
01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
think there's a there's a ton of options
 
01:28:05.209 --> 01:28:05.219 align:start position:0%
and I would hope that the study
 
01:28:07.370 --> 01:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
committee can figure that out thank you
 
01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:08.810 align:start position:0%
committee can figure that out thank you
senator

01:28:08.810 --> 01:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
sure um thank you senator for the
 
01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:19.669 align:start position:0%
sure um thank you senator for the
question

01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
or not there's a concern about
 
01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.590 align:start position:0%
or not there's a concern about
um

01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
at least Gathering or absorbing some
 
01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
data about
 
01:28:30.050 --> 01:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
materials that might come in that are
 
01:28:32.930 --> 01:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
hazardous or contain other contaminants
 
01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
um and is there a way to establish what
 
01:28:37.970 --> 01:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
percentage of those are coming
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
from uh into those unlimited service
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
areas from out of state or if you're
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
intending to look at that I think that's
 
01:28:47.930 --> 01:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
an excellent question and I I'm sure Des
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
is behind me and I would ask the
 
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
pertinent questions that uh what exactly
 
01:28:53.689 --> 01:28:53.699 align:start position:0%
is coming from out of state what type of
 
01:28:59.330 --> 01:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:29:07.129 --> 01:29:07.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
do we export any Trash any waste it's a
 
01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
great question
 
01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:12.709 align:start position:0%
great question
um

01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:14.689 --> 01:29:14.699 align:start position:0%
I'll have to ask the es behind me
 
01:29:20.090 --> 01:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.610 --> 01:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
and I see none thank you very much for
 
01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
your thank you for introducing the bill
 
01:29:31.129 --> 01:29:31.139 align:start position:0%
today and I wonder uh if director wimsat
 
01:29:33.129 --> 01:29:33.139 align:start position:0%
might come
 
01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
to the to the table I I have a couple of
 
01:29:41.570 --> 01:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
questions regarding this that but you
 
01:29:43.970 --> 01:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
know there were some figures and numbers
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
tossed around regarding
 
01:29:49.490 --> 01:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
um percentages of uh out of state trash
 
01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:50.570 align:start position:0%
um percentages of uh out of state trash
and

01:29:50.570 --> 01:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:54.110 --> 01:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you if you know uh more
 
01:29:56.990 --> 01:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
specifically what those percentages are
 
01:29:59.709 --> 01:29:59.719 align:start position:0%
for how much how much out-of-state trash
 
01:30:02.570 --> 01:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
comes to New Hampshire and how much do
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
we export out
 
01:30:06.649 --> 01:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
um you know so for the record Mike
 
01:30:09.709 --> 01:30:09.719 align:start position:0%
wimsat I service director of the waste
 
01:30:10.850 --> 01:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
management division for New Hampshire
 
01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:12.590 align:start position:0%
management division for New Hampshire
Des

01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
Des
 
01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:13.610 align:start position:0%
Des
um

01:30:13.610 --> 01:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
the numbers that the senator was putting
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
out there were about right I think it's
 
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
around 45 for the last year where we
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
have reliable data just a couple years
 
01:30:24.530 --> 01:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
back it was on the order of about 45
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
percent uh came from out of state and uh
 
01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
the amount of waste that New Hampshire
 
01:30:32.330 --> 01:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
exports is less than 10 percent
 
01:30:34.610 --> 01:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
um it varies from year to year but it's
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
on the order it's a single digits what
 
01:30:39.410 --> 01:30:39.420 align:start position:0%
are the types of things that we export
 
01:30:41.570 --> 01:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
you know that's a great question I think
 
01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
they tend to be things that are just of
 
01:30:45.050 --> 01:30:45.060 align:start position:0%
convenience if you look at the border
 
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
and you've got a business they may hire
 
01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
a local trash hauler that happens to be
 
01:30:51.770 --> 01:30:51.780 align:start position:0%
housed across the border and use a
 
01:30:53.570 --> 01:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
facility you know in Vermont or in Maine
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
or something like that they're I'm not
 
01:30:58.490 --> 01:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
aware of any sort of specific
 
01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
um you know deficiency in New
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's ability to handle waste I
 
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
think it's more a function of
 
01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:05.570 align:start position:0%
think it's more a function of
convenience

01:31:05.570 --> 01:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
convenience
 
01:31:08.209 --> 01:31:08.219 align:start position:0%
uh yeah representative germano thank you
 
01:31:09.709 --> 01:31:09.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair and
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
director for taking my question it was
 
01:31:12.890 --> 01:31:12.900 align:start position:0%
connected to the to uh the chair's
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
question about what we we export
 
01:31:16.850 --> 01:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
um do do we do you know do we export
 
01:31:19.490 --> 01:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
some uh food waste because I'm thinking
 
01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
about like in Keen we've got a kind of a
 
01:31:23.090 --> 01:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
startup composting business and he'll
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
compost for example like coffee cups
 
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
that are compostable right you need to
 
01:31:29.930 --> 01:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
have a certain uh amount of compost
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
right I mean those are those are food
 
01:31:33.649 --> 01:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
waste specific sites and I believe he
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
exports out of state so it's just a
 
01:31:36.169 --> 01:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
question connected to the chairs
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
question if that's an example of
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
something that we tend to uh ship out of
 
01:31:42.169 --> 01:31:42.179 align:start position:0%
state that's probably a great example I
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
know that a lot of supermarkets um that
 
01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
generate a significant amount of food
 
01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
waste already have arrangements with
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
out-of-state facilities to manage their
 
01:31:52.729 --> 01:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
food waste so that's probably represents
 
01:31:56.090 --> 01:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
a meaningful part of that percentage
 
01:31:57.890 --> 01:31:57.900 align:start position:0%
thank you director thank you manager and
 
01:31:59.870 --> 01:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
so I know that you are also a member of
 
01:32:02.570 --> 01:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group
 
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
um and I'm new to that uh body and I
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
wonder do you do you know of any plans
 
01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
of solid waste working group addressing
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
this issue of out-of-state trash
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
so the solid waste working group is uh
 
01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
you know has in its first year of
 
01:32:19.850 --> 01:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
operation really focused pretty
 
01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
significantly had a strong focus on the
 
01:32:24.050 --> 01:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
development of our state Solid Waste
 
01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.219 align:start position:0%
Management plan and now they're really
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
beginning to start to take individual
 
01:32:30.890 --> 01:32:30.900 align:start position:0%
topics and and learn about them most
 
01:32:32.330 --> 01:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
recently we've spent a couple of
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
meetings with presentations related to
 
01:32:37.129 --> 01:32:37.139 align:start position:0%
food waste reduction actually
 
01:32:39.229 --> 01:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
um so I do think that the the chair
 
01:32:41.810 --> 01:32:41.820 align:start position:0%
wants to develop maybe you know look out
 
01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
in the next six months and and decide
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
which topics the group will will uh
 
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
we'll review in detail um and that
 
01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
certainly could be one of them I don't
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
honestly know if it's specifically been
 
01:32:56.990 --> 01:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
identified as a near-term uh topic of uh
 
01:32:58.970 --> 01:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
investigation thank you for that
 
01:33:00.890 --> 01:33:00.900 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins
 
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
um director wimsat I'm interested in how
 
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
we actually Trace Trace what out of
 
01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
state trash is coming you mentioned the
 
01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:15.900 align:start position:0%
last data that we have how do we measure
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
it right so every every facility every
 
01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
permanent facility is required to file
 
01:33:23.090 --> 01:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
what's called an annual facility report
 
01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
or an AFR and those are due in the
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
spring of each year and then we you know
 
01:33:29.810 --> 01:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
spend some time compiling that
 
01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:30.790 align:start position:0%
spend some time compiling that
information

01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:33:33.530 --> 01:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
and that's why I say I think I think the
 
01:33:35.149 --> 01:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
the year that I'm probably quoting is
 
01:33:37.490 --> 01:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
one year back because those reports have
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
just become due and we haven't compiled
 
01:33:43.370 --> 01:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
the data for for 22 yet but um basically
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
that those annual facility reports are
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
required to include a host of
 
01:33:49.370 --> 01:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
information related to the types of
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
waste that have been accepted and the
 
01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
origin of the waste so that's how that's
 
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
where we determine how much of the waste
 
01:33:56.810 --> 01:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
that has been received at our disposal
 
01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
facilities comes from out of state thank
 
01:34:01.370 --> 01:34:01.380 align:start position:0%
you representative Bixby
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:04.250 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm the the study committee is
 
01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
talking about looking at unlimited
 
01:34:13.129 --> 01:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
service areas and in terms of Permitting
 
01:34:15.370 --> 01:34:15.380 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering whether
 
01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
uh there are separate types of permits
 
01:34:21.410 --> 01:34:21.420 align:start position:0%
for limited versus unlimited service
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
areas and whether that is dependent on
 
01:34:29.209 --> 01:34:29.219 align:start position:0%
the type of ownership of the facility
 
01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
and and whether it might be whether
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
there's even a possibility of saying
 
01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
well we'll do a limited service area
 
01:34:38.450 --> 01:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
permit and they're sure and use that to
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
get rid of out of state waste so so
 
01:34:43.970 --> 01:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
really the decision about what serve
 
01:34:46.370 --> 01:34:46.380 align:start position:0%
what area a particular facility wants to
 
01:34:48.770 --> 01:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
service is is that of the applicant that
 
01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
when they decide they want to propose a
 
01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
facility and they decide who they want
 
01:34:55.010 --> 01:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
to service who they want their customers
 
01:34:57.649 --> 01:34:57.659 align:start position:0%
to be they provide that information in
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
their application and for we do have a
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
number of limited service area
 
01:35:05.149 --> 01:35:05.159 align:start position:0%
facilities in the state and I'll just go
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
through them because I think it's
 
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
helpful to understand city of Nashville
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
operates its own own landfill its
 
01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
service area is limited to the city of
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
Nashua and um then there are a couple of
 
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh communities associated with
 
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
um their former Solid Waste District
 
01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
that can also bring asbestos waste
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
specifically to but for MSW and straight
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
up trash
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
um basically the city of Nashville only
 
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
accepts waste from within the city
 
01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.430 align:start position:0%
accepts waste from within the city
limits

01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
limits
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
um Lebanon landfill is the limited
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
service area landfill it's a little
 
01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
broader than that it includes I think
 
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
about six or seven New Hampshire towns
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
and six or seven Vermont towns and
 
01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's the service area that they
 
01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
specified we didn't we didn't dictate
 
01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
that as part of permanent that's what
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
they asked for and that's what they got
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
for a permit and then the Conway uh or
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
Mount Washington Valley facility takes I
 
01:36:03.410 --> 01:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
think from Conway Albany and Eaton
 
01:36:05.689 --> 01:36:05.699 align:start position:0%
that's the service area that they desire
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
to serve and that's the apartment they
 
01:36:10.729 --> 01:36:10.739 align:start position:0%
have so to go to your question if um you
 
01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
know I guess to put it in practice in a
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
permitting scenario let's say that a
 
01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
private company came in to uh and
 
01:36:19.729 --> 01:36:19.739 align:start position:0%
decided they wanted to have a limited
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
service permit to operate a Waste
 
01:36:24.850 --> 01:36:24.860 align:start position:0%
Management Facility in Nashua
 
01:36:26.930 --> 01:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
that would be a little bit of a tough
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
road to hoe for them because the city of
 
01:36:30.169 --> 01:36:30.179 align:start position:0%
nashua's facility
 
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
serves Nashua and serves it adequately
 
01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
so when we would look at doing a public
 
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
benefit determination for a facility
 
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
like that we would likely conclude and I
 
01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
don't ever like to prejudge anything but
 
01:36:42.050 --> 01:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
we'd likely conclude that a facility
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
that was only going to provide service
 
01:36:45.530 --> 01:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
for Nashua wasn't really needed because
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
there was adequate service for all of
 
01:36:50.209 --> 01:36:50.219 align:start position:0%
Nashville's waste so that you know is we
 
01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
could that's an example of a very
 
01:36:54.770 --> 01:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
hypothetical example of how a decision
 
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
might weigh in with respect to either
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
limited service area or unlimited
 
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
service area in practice the commercial
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
facilities that come to us those those
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
facilities I described you before are
 
01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
all municipally owned and operated the
 
01:37:08.930 --> 01:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
privately owned and operated facilities
 
01:37:10.490 --> 01:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
that come before us for permits
 
01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
typically request an unlimited service
 
01:37:15.290 --> 01:37:15.300 align:start position:0%
area which means they can take waste
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
from from anywhere thank you
 
01:37:18.649 --> 01:37:18.659 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton you had a
 
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
question yes ma'am chair thank you and
 
01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
um just trying to wrap a couple things
 
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
around my head here so you said that the
 
01:37:31.129 --> 01:37:31.139 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group was looking
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
for additional topics to study
 
01:37:36.649 --> 01:37:36.659 align:start position:0%
with respect I'm not sure I said it that
 
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
way we we have a directive under the law
 
01:37:42.110 --> 01:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
that that outlines a number of topics
 
01:37:45.050 --> 01:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
that we can and should study and what I
 
01:37:46.610 --> 01:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
guess I what I should have said is the
 
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
chair is trying to decide in what order
 
01:37:51.050 --> 01:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
we take those and and how we how we
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
study them I don't think that the chair
 
01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:55.380 align:start position:0%
or the the group as a whole is looking
 
01:37:58.189 --> 01:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
for new expanded things to study with
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
the the the job we have under the under
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
the law that created the solid waste
 
01:38:04.370 --> 01:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
working group is already big enough so I
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
think we're trying to limit what we do
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
to those issues that were identified for
 
01:38:10.750 --> 01:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
our investigation for a follow-up good
 
01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
and is this and this is not one of those
 
01:38:17.090 --> 01:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think the term unlimited
 
01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
service area appears in the law that
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
created the solid waste working group
 
01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
there certainly is discussion about
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
um I think there's some reference to
 
01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
out-of-state ways but I I apologize I
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
don't remember exactly what the language
 
01:38:28.679 --> 01:38:34.910 align:start position:0%
don't remember exactly what the language
was

01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
I get I mean in my mind rather than
 
01:38:40.129 --> 01:38:40.139 align:start position:0%
committing you know resources to another
 
01:38:40.139 --> 01:38:41.390 align:start position:0%
committing you know resources to another
commission

01:38:41.390 --> 01:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:38:43.129 --> 01:38:43.139 align:start position:0%
it was saying to me you got the right
 
01:38:45.530 --> 01:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
people in the right place to do this in
 
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
an amendment to this would say hey you
 
01:38:51.229 --> 01:38:51.239 align:start position:0%
guys are already working on it work on
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
this too would that make sense to you
 
01:38:54.770 --> 01:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't want to testify for
 
01:38:56.689 --> 01:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
anybody else so I'm speaking just solely
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the department I believe
 
01:39:01.070 --> 01:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
that um we recognize that there's a
 
01:39:02.689 --> 01:39:02.699 align:start position:0%
difference between something like the
 
01:39:04.370 --> 01:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group which is a
 
01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
group of it's a really
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
robust group of people from all across
 
01:39:11.930 --> 01:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
different uh expertises and sectors we
 
01:39:13.129 --> 01:39:13.139 align:start position:0%
have people from the solid waste
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
industry we have people from the
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
hospital Association we have a whole
 
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
host of folks who bring a really great
 
01:39:21.050 --> 01:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
core of knowledge to those discussions
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
we recognize that a legislative study
 
01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
committee is a different animal that
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
it's really just comprised of
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
legislators and it and it you know and I
 
01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
think the chair you know has articulated
 
01:39:33.050 --> 01:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
to me uh representative evil that you
 
01:39:35.930 --> 01:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
know her uh study committee House Bill
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
413 which looked at really broadly at
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
solid waste a number of years ago it was
 
01:39:43.129 --> 01:39:43.139 align:start position:0%
a really powerful tool that she really
 
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
appreciated being able to use because
 
01:39:47.090 --> 01:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
being comprised only of a handful of
 
01:39:49.129 --> 01:39:49.139 align:start position:0%
legislators she could schedule meetings
 
01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
and she had something on the order of I
 
01:39:52.850 --> 01:39:52.860 align:start position:0%
don't know 15 or 16 meetings in the
 
01:39:54.590 --> 01:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
course of two months and they were able
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
to bring in people from all across the
 
01:39:58.850 --> 01:39:58.860 align:start position:0%
sectors of information they were trying
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
to gather so I I wouldn't and again I
 
01:40:03.169 --> 01:40:03.179 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize DS did not come today
 
01:40:04.910 --> 01:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
prepared to take a position on this bill
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
we don't start a position on it and
 
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
General we generally we never object to
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
custody committees because we feel if
 
01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature decides it wants to
 
01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
study an issue it should who are we to
 
01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:17.820 align:start position:0%
object or support it either way so I we
 
01:40:19.729 --> 01:40:19.739 align:start position:0%
don't have a position on it but I but we
 
01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
do recognize that there's a difference
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
between the kind of work a working group
 
01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
like the solid waste working group can
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
do and the work that a legislative
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
committee can do
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you
 
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
option uh thank you director
 
01:40:36.770 --> 01:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
um so to your
 
01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:38.270 align:start position:0%
um so to your
um

01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:41.570 --> 01:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
so to enter to I guess follow up on your
 
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
statement about there being roughly 45
 
01:40:46.370 --> 01:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
percent of trash imported versus the 10
 
01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:48.229 align:start position:0%
percent of trash imported versus the 10
export

01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
export
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
um would you in with regard to this
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
proposed piece of legislation feel
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
confident that the data that you have
 
01:40:57.290 --> 01:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
from uh last year
 
01:40:59.450 --> 01:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
um which would be 2021 correct I think
 
01:41:00.530 --> 01:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
that's right yes
 
01:41:03.050 --> 01:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
um would be sufficient in their findings
 
01:41:05.629 --> 01:41:05.639 align:start position:0%
to be able to do the study committee I I
 
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
don't yes I don't have reason to believe
 
01:41:09.169 --> 01:41:09.179 align:start position:0%
that the data once the new data we're
 
01:41:11.209 --> 01:41:11.219 align:start position:0%
collecting once analyzed will be
 
01:41:15.530 --> 01:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.890 --> 01:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:41:21.649 --> 01:41:21.659 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much for uh for
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
coming up at my bequest you're welcome
 
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate you taking some
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
questions even though you were not
 
01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
expecting to speak on this bill today
 
01:41:32.330 --> 01:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
and I would like to see the blue sheet
 
01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Davis
 
01:41:38.209 --> 01:41:38.219 align:start position:0%
there was nothing uh no no testimony
 
01:41:41.209 --> 01:41:41.219 align:start position:0%
online or support or opposition
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:47.390 align:start position:0%
 
or

01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:41:49.729 --> 01:41:49.739 align:start position:0%
SB 159
 
01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
we have two people
 
01:41:57.290 --> 01:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
who have indicated Pro
 
01:41:59.149 --> 01:41:59.159 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to close the hearing
 
01:42:04.370 --> 01:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
for 159 unless anyone else has any other
 
01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:06.590 align:start position:0%
for 159 unless anyone else has any other
comment

01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:11.450 --> 01:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
and we will take a very short break
 
01:42:13.729 --> 01:42:13.739 align:start position:0%
because in three minutes we will be
 
01:42:34.930 --> 01:42:34.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
I will talk to her about that and I
 
01:42:40.669 --> 01:42:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.090 --> 01:42:43.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:46.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:48.770 --> 01:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna I'm gonna be leaving in
 
01:42:54.050 --> 01:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:56.810 --> 01:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
I don't know what that would be but
 
01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:00.370 align:start position:0%
I don't know what that would be but
um

01:43:00.370 --> 01:43:00.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:06.189 --> 01:43:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:06.199 --> 01:43:09.550 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
why don't we do that because it's that
 
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.270 align:start position:0%
why don't we do that because it's that
way

01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:43:15.709 --> 01:43:15.719 align:start position:0%
sure for this and I'm gonna go sit over
 
01:43:19.370 --> 01:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:30.290 align:start position:0%
 
better

01:43:30.290 --> 01:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:56.229 align:start position:0%
 
teacher

01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:03.050 --> 01:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:03.060 --> 01:44:18.070 align:start position:0%
 
um sorry

01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.570 --> 01:44:22.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
testimony on 267. okay
 
01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
okay I think another thing but it could
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
come out and solubles yeah yeah that's
 
01:44:59.870 --> 01:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
it Gene pills up I'm gonna talk to
 
01:44:59.880 --> 01:47:26.209 align:start position:0%
it Gene pills up I'm gonna talk to
um

01:47:26.209 --> 01:47:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:26.219 --> 01:47:29.590 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
so we will be getting underway with uh
 
01:47:36.590 --> 01:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
the hearing for Senate bill 267.
 
01:47:39.410 --> 01:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
and I see Senator Al Schiller
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
so I will open this hearing for SB 267
 
01:47:45.050 --> 01:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
requiring the commissioner of Department
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services
 
01:47:50.209 --> 01:47:50.219 align:start position:0%
to consider cumulative impacts analysis
 
01:47:55.129 --> 01:47:55.139 align:start position:0%
in rules and statutes and I invite
 
01:47:57.649 --> 01:47:57.659 align:start position:0%
Senator Al sheller who is the Prime
 
01:47:59.570 --> 01:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill to come in
 
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
introduce it to us thank you
 
01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
for coming this morning
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair good morning
 
01:48:09.530 --> 01:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
committee members thank you very much
 
01:48:12.010 --> 01:48:12.020 align:start position:0%
for your time this morning
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:18.890 --> 01:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
written remarks that I'm giving you now
 
01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
will be coming in there's a copy issue
 
01:48:26.209 --> 01:48:26.219 align:start position:0%
happening so thank you very much my name
 
01:48:29.209 --> 01:48:29.219 align:start position:0%
is Deborah alchler I represent Senate
 
01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
District 24 which includes the towns of
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
Exeter Greenland Hampton Hampton Falls
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
Northampton rye and stratum and I'm here
 
01:48:42.169 --> 01:48:42.179 align:start position:0%
to introduce Senate Bill 267 which has a
 
01:48:44.570 --> 01:48:44.580 align:start position:0%
new title relative to the rulemaking for
 
01:48:48.189 --> 01:48:48.199 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling facilities
 
01:48:52.209 --> 01:48:52.219 align:start position:0%
granted this bill has had a major change
 
01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
since its introduction
 
01:49:00.590 --> 01:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
and I would like to speak to the uh the
 
01:49:03.890 --> 01:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
reason we we need to do this and we're
 
01:49:05.930 --> 01:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
where We've Ended up and I put it in
 
01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
your hands after that if we only knew
 
01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
then what we know now
 
01:49:17.149 --> 01:49:17.159 align:start position:0%
I wish I knew this would have been great
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
to know beforehand
 
01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
all statements of regret those are all
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
statements uttered after a decision was
 
01:49:28.689 --> 01:49:28.699 align:start position:0%
made without all of the information
 
01:49:32.450 --> 01:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
needed to make a good decision
 
01:49:35.090 --> 01:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
the repercussions from bad decisions
 
01:49:37.129 --> 01:49:37.139 align:start position:0%
made out of ignorance
 
01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
don't mitigate Damage Done
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
but hopefully they guide our future
 
01:49:44.810 --> 01:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
decision making
 
01:49:47.689 --> 01:49:47.699 align:start position:0%
we have an opportunity right now to
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
guide good decision making for the
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
future of New Hampshire's air water and
 
01:49:56.810 --> 01:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
soil qualities because we have good
 
01:49:59.209 --> 01:49:59.219 align:start position:0%
information that we can use to be
 
01:50:02.570 --> 01:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
proactive in this venture
 
01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
there is an emerging and untested
 
01:50:07.609 --> 01:50:07.619 align:start position:0%
Industry in the country which is
 
01:50:10.450 --> 01:50:10.460 align:start position:0%
referenced in the original bill
 
01:50:13.250 --> 01:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
and we actually have a pilot program for
 
01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
it here in New Hampshire and it's called
 
01:50:19.490 --> 01:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:21.590 --> 01:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
things are often named for that which
 
01:50:24.590 --> 01:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
they are sort of but not really for
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
instance I live on Apple way and there's
 
01:50:29.149 --> 01:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
no apple orchards anymore so you kind of
 
01:50:31.609 --> 01:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
get that so Advanced recycling as an
 
01:50:33.709 --> 01:50:33.719 align:start position:0%
industrial process it brings a broad
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
range of toxic pollutants through a
 
01:50:38.450 --> 01:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
process of high heating for production
 
01:50:41.930 --> 01:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
of what is referred to as feed stock to
 
01:50:43.850 --> 01:50:43.860 align:start position:0%
be used for the production of new
 
01:50:46.850 --> 01:50:46.860 align:start position:0%
Plastic Products
 
01:50:49.810 --> 01:50:49.820 align:start position:0%
what is in the Plastics being repurposed
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
include per and polyfluorinated Alkali
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
substances pfas Benzene heavy metals and
 
01:51:01.729 --> 01:51:01.739 align:start position:0%
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that
 
01:51:03.709 --> 01:51:03.719 align:start position:0%
can be present in plastic materials
 
01:51:07.250 --> 01:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
processed through advanced recycling the
 
01:51:10.609 --> 01:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
potential for such toxic pollutants to
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
result in air water and soil pollution
 
01:51:17.209 --> 01:51:17.219 align:start position:0%
that is harmful to the public health and
 
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
the environment
 
01:51:20.689 --> 01:51:20.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has the unfortunate
 
01:51:23.450 --> 01:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
experience of dealing with widespread
 
01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
pfas pollution that has resulted already
 
01:51:29.209 --> 01:51:29.219 align:start position:0%
in public health emergencies closed
 
01:51:31.729 --> 01:51:31.739 align:start position:0%
drinking water wells and has spurred the
 
01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
federal government to help bring in
 
01:51:36.169 --> 01:51:36.179 align:start position:0%
cleaning up the polluted areas and we're
 
01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
still not done
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
what we didn't know when we were using
 
01:51:44.270 --> 01:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
pfas Laden products and I say what we
 
01:51:46.490 --> 01:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
didn't know
 
01:51:49.450 --> 01:51:49.460 align:start position:0%
things like firefighting foam was
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
exposure to pfas the per and polyfloral
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
Alkali substances has been linked to a
 
01:51:59.330 --> 01:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
range of health problems including liver
 
01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
damage thyroid problems weakened immune
 
01:52:06.050 --> 01:52:06.060 align:start position:0%
systems cancers developmental issues
 
01:52:09.050 --> 01:52:09.060 align:start position:0%
reproductive problems in in the form of
 
01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
decreased fertility and Cancers that
 
01:52:14.209 --> 01:52:14.219 align:start position:0%
include liver testicular and kidney
 
01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
Cancers and that is not even an
 
01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
exhaustive list
 
01:52:21.649 --> 01:52:21.659 align:start position:0%
we may not have known all of those
 
01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
things until fairly recently but it
 
01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
turns out that the maker of the most
 
01:52:30.109 --> 01:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
commonly produced products with pfas in
 
01:52:33.770 --> 01:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
them did in fact documents recovered
 
01:52:36.050 --> 01:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
show that the DuPont company's own
 
01:52:40.729 --> 01:52:40.739 align:start position:0%
researchers knew back in 1961 that this
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
chemical was toxic and then they
 
01:52:45.709 --> 01:52:45.719 align:start position:0%
proceeded to bury that information while
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
producing thousands of products that
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
have done and still do real harm to our
 
01:52:53.450 --> 01:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
public health and environmental safety
 
01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
in 1978 3M knew through their own
 
01:53:00.890 --> 01:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
studies that their employees were
 
01:53:03.169 --> 01:53:03.179 align:start position:0%
accumulating this toxin in their blood
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
and they buried this information too
 
01:53:08.930 --> 01:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
while their own employees developed
 
01:53:11.930 --> 01:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
fatal cancers
 
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
so the cumulative health impact of
 
01:53:17.689 --> 01:53:17.699 align:start position:0%
exposure to people through their
 
01:53:20.450 --> 01:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
environment were never addressed when
 
01:53:23.090 --> 01:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
companies like Dupont and 3M were
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
permitted to do business here in New
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we know better than to leave
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
the entirety of research of safety to
 
01:53:34.850 --> 01:53:34.860 align:start position:0%
the companies who have Financial
 
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
interests as their primary directive not
 
01:53:40.129 --> 01:53:40.139 align:start position:0%
our Public Health
 
01:53:44.570 --> 01:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
it is prudent for us to ensure public
 
01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
health and environmental safety and to
 
01:53:51.530 --> 01:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
avoid the adverse economic impacts of
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
pollution by establishing appropriate
 
01:53:58.250 --> 01:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
rules that take into account the
 
01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts of citing
 
01:54:04.810 --> 01:54:04.820 align:start position:0%
manufacturing Recycling and waste sites
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
none of these things exist in a vacuum
 
01:54:12.770 --> 01:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
and assessing a site permit in a silo is
 
01:54:15.410 --> 01:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
an outdated and ineffective way to
 
01:54:17.570 --> 01:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
address potential damage to the
 
01:54:19.729 --> 01:54:19.739 align:start position:0%
communities they're located in
 
01:54:22.970 --> 01:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts results when the
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
effect of an action are added to or
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
interact with other effects in a
 
01:54:33.169 --> 01:54:33.179 align:start position:0%
particular place and within a particular
 
01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
time New Hampshire needs to invest in
 
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
giving the Department of Environmental
 
01:54:42.649 --> 01:54:42.659 align:start position:0%
Services the resources they need to
 
01:54:45.669 --> 01:54:45.679 align:start position:0%
dedicate a staff member to researching
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts so will we learn from
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
our past will we recognize that without
 
01:54:58.270 --> 01:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
strong rules and guardrails about
 
01:55:01.129 --> 01:55:01.139 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts
 
01:55:03.770 --> 01:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
will we expect chemical companies to
 
01:55:05.930 --> 01:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
protect our Public Health
 
01:55:08.330 --> 01:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
that's like expecting Lucy to let
 
01:55:10.609 --> 01:55:10.619 align:start position:0%
Charlie Brown kick the football
 
01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
for the health of our people and the
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
environment of the state we love I
 
01:55:19.310 --> 01:55:19.320 align:start position:0%
strongly urge the committee to recommend
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 267 ought to pass and give
 
01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
the resources they need to help us
 
01:55:31.070 --> 01:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
protect our Public Health thank you so
 
01:55:33.229 --> 01:55:33.239 align:start position:0%
much for your time today thank you
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
Senator Earl Schiller I'm interested to
 
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
know if you believe
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
um that the report out date of June 30th
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
2025 is an adequate time frame
 
01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
to produce the information that this
 
01:55:52.010 --> 01:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
bill seeks
 
01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:53.689 align:start position:0%
bill seeks
I

01:55:53.689 --> 01:55:53.699 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:55:56.750 --> 01:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
to be perfectly honest with you that was
 
01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
a Compromise date I think it'd be I
 
01:56:00.649 --> 01:56:00.659 align:start position:0%
personally think it could be done sooner
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
but sure June 2025 that's that's what
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
was um
 
01:56:08.090 --> 01:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
that was the date that could get us all
 
01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:09.530 align:start position:0%
that was the date that could get us all
here

01:56:09.530 --> 01:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:56:12.250 --> 01:56:12.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:24.770 --> 01:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
oh the report out date and I'm sorry
 
01:56:27.530 --> 01:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
you're correct because in section one it
 
01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
says November 1st
 
01:56:32.750 --> 01:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
2025. yeah it says the report uh Madam
 
01:56:36.590 --> 01:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
chair the the 30 June 30 date is is the
 
01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:38.750 align:start position:0%
chair the the 30 June 30 date is is the
appropriation

01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:56:41.570 --> 01:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
um interesting right okay so that
 
01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
representative yeah so
 
01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:45.890 align:start position:0%
representative yeah so
um

01:56:45.890 --> 01:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:48.109 --> 01:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
uh I have a there are a couple of
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
questions that I have which are kind of
 
01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
related in terms of potential amendments
 
01:56:54.290 --> 01:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
and they're they're pretty tiny uh one
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
is that our committee is in fact not
 
01:56:58.450 --> 01:56:58.460 align:start position:0%
listed on as a recipient of the report
 
01:57:01.370 --> 01:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
and uh it would be nice to have our
 
01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh listed as a report
 
01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:04.970 align:start position:0%
committee uh listed as a report
recipient

01:57:04.970 --> 01:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
recipient
 
01:57:06.410 --> 01:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
um would you have any objection to that
 
01:57:08.570 --> 01:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
I think that's an excellent idea
 
01:57:11.149 --> 01:57:11.159 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby okay and the second
 
01:57:12.890 --> 01:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:57:12.900 --> 01:57:13.550 align:start position:0%
is that
um

01:57:13.550 --> 01:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
a report out date of November 1st allows
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
for the Senate to write bills related to
 
01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
it but that's after our bill writing
 
01:57:25.310 --> 01:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
deadline so I was wondering if you might
 
01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
be amenable to changing it to September
 
01:57:31.609 --> 01:57:31.619 align:start position:0%
1st also an excellent idea the more
 
01:57:34.129 --> 01:57:34.139 align:start position:0%
legislators who have opportunities to
 
01:57:36.589 --> 01:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
write legislation protective of our air
 
01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
water and soil
 
01:57:40.970 --> 01:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
adds more voices to the table so I think
 
01:57:44.030 --> 01:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea thank you thank you
 
01:57:46.970 --> 01:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
representative detsee
 
01:57:48.770 --> 01:57:48.780 align:start position:0%
ah thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:57:53.570 --> 01:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
in reviewing this bill I went back to
 
01:57:57.530 --> 01:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
the original bill which was 267 FN not
 
01:58:00.890 --> 01:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
the event amended virgin I was surprised
 
01:58:02.570 --> 01:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
to see that it was two and a half pages
 
01:58:06.609 --> 01:58:06.619 align:start position:0%
long and quite detailed as opposed to
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment that I have in front of me
 
01:58:12.649 --> 01:58:12.659 align:start position:0%
which is two paragraphs I also went back
 
01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
and looked at the testimony that came
 
01:58:16.970 --> 01:58:16.980 align:start position:0%
before the senate committee
 
01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
and recognize that there were 130
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
individuals that signed in in support of
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
the original Bill and there were only
 
01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
four people that were signed in to
 
01:58:30.530 --> 01:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill uh when you had a second
 
01:58:32.209 --> 01:58:32.219 align:start position:0%
committee meeting on it I believe there
 
01:58:36.290 --> 01:58:36.300 align:start position:0%
were 55 people that signed in for uh in
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
support of the bill so my question is is
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
how did we get from a quite detailed
 
01:58:44.990 --> 01:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
Bill two and a half pages to what I
 
01:58:47.629 --> 01:58:47.639 align:start position:0%
considered to be a neutered bill of two
 
01:58:47.639 --> 01:58:50.689 align:start position:0%
considered to be a neutered bill of two
paragraphs

01:58:50.689 --> 01:58:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
and I have a follow-up
 
01:58:56.930 --> 01:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
um I thank you representative for your
 
01:59:00.189 --> 01:59:00.199 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for outlining the
 
01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
tremendous community support from all
 
01:59:06.430 --> 01:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
over the state for the original
 
01:59:09.410 --> 01:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
writing of 267 which also happened to
 
01:59:12.410 --> 01:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
have included an incredibly large number
 
01:59:15.410 --> 01:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
of stakeholders
 
01:59:19.010 --> 01:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
as you described neutering of the bill
 
01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:24.830 align:start position:0%
as you described neutering of the bill
um

01:59:24.830 --> 01:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
I would say that it was
 
01:59:31.199 --> 01:59:33.290 align:start position:0%
I would say that it was
hmm

01:59:33.290 --> 01:59:33.300 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
assessing cumulative impacts was not
 
01:59:41.689 --> 01:59:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:44.410 --> 01:59:44.420 align:start position:0%
some members of our
 
01:59:46.970 --> 01:59:46.980 align:start position:0%
legislature and
 
01:59:48.530 --> 01:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
so we are
 
01:59:52.189 --> 01:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
we are where we are today I
 
01:59:54.890 --> 01:59:54.900 align:start position:0%
Madam chair disappointing but it is what
 
01:59:58.850 --> 01:59:58.860 align:start position:0%
it is one follow-up okay thank you uh
 
02:00:01.609 --> 02:00:01.619 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that I have
 
02:00:04.850 --> 02:00:04.860 align:start position:0%
um is basically uh
 
02:00:07.370 --> 02:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
02:00:07.380 --> 02:00:08.089 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
um

02:00:08.089 --> 02:00:08.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:10.250 --> 02:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
can move forward
 
02:00:11.810 --> 02:00:11.820 align:start position:0%
are you in the first or the second
 
02:00:14.689 --> 02:00:14.699 align:start position:0%
version I'm sorry yeah I'm I'm looking
 
02:00:17.450 --> 02:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
at the amended Bill thank you okay and
 
02:00:19.490 --> 02:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at lines one through four
 
02:00:22.010 --> 02:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
yes and I won't read the whole thing but
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
what I'm concerned about is that
 
02:00:26.810 --> 02:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
basically if I read that sentence it
 
02:00:29.149 --> 02:00:29.159 align:start position:0%
indicates to me that it is within the
 
02:00:32.810 --> 02:00:32.820 align:start position:0%
commissioner's purview to decide whether
 
02:00:36.649 --> 02:00:36.659 align:start position:0%
or not something should be proposed okay
 
02:00:40.010 --> 02:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
so that what guarantees does this
 
02:00:42.589 --> 02:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
committee have that if we pass this
 
02:00:46.490 --> 02:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
amendment that anything will happen
 
02:00:48.729 --> 02:00:48.739 align:start position:0%
I mean because if I read this correctly
 
02:00:51.050 --> 02:00:51.060 align:start position:0%
it's all within the commissioner's
 
02:00:54.410 --> 02:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
purview can you address that
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question you have
 
02:00:59.810 --> 02:00:59.820 align:start position:0%
read that incredibly astutely
 
02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:01.070 align:start position:0%
read that incredibly astutely
um

02:01:01.070 --> 02:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:05.149 --> 02:01:05.159 align:start position:0%
the commissioner does not make law
 
02:01:05.159 --> 02:01:06.410 align:start position:0%
the commissioner does not make law
so

02:01:06.410 --> 02:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
um representative bixby's
 
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
suggestions of bringing the report
 
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
to the legislature both committees on
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
both the house and the Senate is serve I
 
02:01:23.050 --> 02:01:23.060 align:start position:0%
think well serves
 
02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:26.870 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
um

02:01:26.870 --> 02:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:29.030 --> 02:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
I would hope that the committee would
 
02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
look at the original Bill's statement of
 
02:01:34.910 --> 02:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
purpose and perhaps consider
 
02:01:38.209 --> 02:01:38.219 align:start position:0%
moving that into any amendments that you
 
02:01:39.250 --> 02:01:39.260 align:start position:0%
might write
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
and also your point of
 
02:01:47.870 --> 02:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
legislative proposals being solely from
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
the commissioner might
 
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
might be a very narrow way to look at
 
02:01:54.290 --> 02:01:54.300 align:start position:0%
this and that might be an amendment you
 
02:01:58.370 --> 02:01:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:00.709 --> 02:02:00.719 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins thank you madam
 
02:02:00.719 --> 02:02:01.490 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins thank you madam
chair

02:02:01.490 --> 02:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator lovely to see you here
 
02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:06.410 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator lovely to see you here
today

02:02:06.410 --> 02:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:07.609 align:start position:0%
today
um

02:02:07.609 --> 02:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
I guess after uh representative Dusty's
 
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
comments I'd love to hear that you have
 
02:02:16.910 --> 02:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
confidence that this you know somewhat
 
02:02:20.530 --> 02:02:20.540 align:start position:0%
truncated no doubt compromise
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
ensued bill
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
um it's nice to see you too thank you
 
02:02:33.070 --> 02:02:33.080 align:start position:0%
very much representative Haskins
 
02:02:37.250 --> 02:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
to be perfectly honest with you what I
 
02:02:40.729 --> 02:02:40.739 align:start position:0%
testify to that assessing what the
 
02:02:44.209 --> 02:02:44.219 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts are on our soil water
 
02:02:46.270 --> 02:02:46.280 align:start position:0%
and air
 
02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:48.010 align:start position:0%
and air
matter

02:02:48.010 --> 02:02:48.020 align:start position:0%
matter
 
02:02:51.050 --> 02:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
tremendously they don't exist
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
alone things that are put up into the
 
02:02:58.430 --> 02:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
air often come down and affect the soil
 
02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:01.679 align:start position:0%
we breathe them we eat food grown in
 
02:03:04.850 --> 02:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
that soil we use that water to drink to
 
02:03:08.930 --> 02:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
bathe to make products to make food and
 
02:03:11.629 --> 02:03:11.639 align:start position:0%
so there is there is nothing that is not
 
02:03:14.270 --> 02:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you nothing that is not impacted
 
02:03:17.689 --> 02:03:17.699 align:start position:0%
by something else and up until now we
 
02:03:20.209 --> 02:03:20.219 align:start position:0%
have taken a very siled approach to
 
02:03:22.490 --> 02:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
citing and assessing
 
02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:23.149 align:start position:0%
citing and assessing
um

02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
how something might impact actually not
 
02:03:28.250 --> 02:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
even how it might impact but
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
um how it would fit into a site permit
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
and it's we know better now we just we
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
have more information and we have also
 
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
um been
 
02:03:43.850 --> 02:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
I would Hazard to say lied to by some of
 
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
the industries that have
 
02:03:49.310 --> 02:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
um purposely obfuscated their own
 
02:03:52.510 --> 02:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
research into the ways that they are
 
02:03:56.810 --> 02:03:56.820 align:start position:0%
polluting and affecting our environment
 
02:04:00.250 --> 02:04:00.260 align:start position:0%
and so if we don't take responsibility
 
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
for assessing what those cumulative
 
02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
impacts may be from this site and this
 
02:04:07.490 --> 02:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
site and this site and how it affects
 
02:04:09.290 --> 02:04:09.300 align:start position:0%
our home
 
02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
then shame on us
 
02:04:13.129 --> 02:04:13.139 align:start position:0%
shame on us
 
02:04:17.689 --> 02:04:17.699 align:start position:0%
so cumulative impacts absolutely needs
 
02:04:20.450 --> 02:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
to be assessed if this gets us part of
 
02:04:22.570 --> 02:04:22.580 align:start position:0%
the way there huzzah
 
02:04:27.530 --> 02:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
is it as robust as I would have liked no
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
I am also not in the majority and have
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
the position to write Amendment so there
 
02:04:34.129 --> 02:04:34.139 align:start position:0%
we are thank you senator
 
02:04:37.310 --> 02:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
representing Bixby yeah so
 
02:04:40.850 --> 02:04:40.860 align:start position:0%
um one uh
 
02:04:43.850 --> 02:04:43.860 align:start position:0%
getting back to the question of uh the
 
02:04:49.070 --> 02:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh being the uh essentially
 
02:04:54.169 --> 02:04:54.179 align:start position:0%
the sole person listed here as uh uh who
 
02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
would be recommending uh either rules or
 
02:04:57.900 --> 02:04:59.870 align:start position:0%
would be recommending uh either rules or
legislation

02:04:59.870 --> 02:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:01.490 align:start position:0%
legislation
um

02:05:01.490 --> 02:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:05.450 --> 02:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
is there would three do you think that
 
02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:07.250 align:start position:0%
is there would three do you think that
the

02:05:07.250 --> 02:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:10.370 --> 02:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
um the section one would create a report
 
02:05:13.850 --> 02:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
that is sufficient to allow the
 
02:05:16.010 --> 02:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
legislature to also make a judgment
 
02:05:19.129 --> 02:05:19.139 align:start position:0%
about whether uh
 
02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
whether there should be legislation
 
02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
produced and uh is there some way that
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
that that if this wouldn't produce a
 
02:05:32.810 --> 02:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
sufficient report that we could rephrase
 
02:05:35.450 --> 02:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
this the paragraph one in order to make
 
02:05:37.330 --> 02:05:37.340 align:start position:0%
sure that the report gave the
 
02:05:42.649 --> 02:05:42.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:45.229 --> 02:05:45.239 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question uh
 
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
I see where you're going with that and
 
02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
um I think you know
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
it is the it is the purview this bill
 
02:05:55.550 --> 02:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
belongs to you now it's yours
 
02:05:57.890 --> 02:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
um and if in the course of your
 
02:06:01.250 --> 02:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
executive decision exact executive
 
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
session discussion
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
um that the committee feels a more
 
02:06:08.629 --> 02:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
robust report delivered to the
 
02:06:08.639 --> 02:06:10.430 align:start position:0%
robust report delivered to the
legislature

02:06:10.430 --> 02:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:06:13.070 --> 02:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
um for the legislatures
 
02:06:16.629 --> 02:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
decision making process about
 
02:06:20.890 --> 02:06:20.900 align:start position:0%
determination of possible rules or
 
02:06:23.330 --> 02:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
recommendations for rules or legislation
 
02:06:26.930 --> 02:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
is more appropriate I
 
02:06:29.810 --> 02:06:29.820 align:start position:0%
I I'm not going to be making phone calls
 
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
stopping that if that's what you're
 
02:06:35.149 --> 02:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
asking for all right thank you
 
02:06:37.729 --> 02:06:37.739 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:06:40.070 --> 02:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your introducing this bill
 
02:06:41.810 --> 02:06:41.820 align:start position:0%
to us today thank you very much I
 
02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and I am now going to call
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
Craig Wright from Des to come and speak
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:54.950 --> 02:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members of the
 
02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh through my years of service
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
I haven't been before this committee
 
02:07:03.530 --> 02:07:03.540 align:start position:0%
very often usually I'm before St e but
 
02:07:05.089 --> 02:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
it's certainly a pleasure to be here
 
02:07:07.010 --> 02:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
today so
 
02:07:09.109 --> 02:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
um I thought what I would do is I'll
 
02:07:11.089 --> 02:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
introduce myself Craig Wright I serve as
 
02:07:13.010 --> 02:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
the Director of the air Resources
 
02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
Division at the Department of
 
02:07:16.250 --> 02:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services also with me
 
02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
today is Kathy beam
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
so if you if you stump me I may turn to
 
02:07:22.910 --> 02:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
her with some of your questions so I
 
02:07:24.649 --> 02:07:24.659 align:start position:0%
thought what I'd do is just kind of
 
02:07:26.810 --> 02:07:26.820 align:start position:0%
describe a couple areas where in the
 
02:07:28.970 --> 02:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
regulatory world where we're hearing
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
this term cumulative impact and what's
 
02:07:33.649 --> 02:07:33.659 align:start position:0%
being done about it and then also give a
 
02:07:35.810 --> 02:07:35.820 align:start position:0%
couple of examples of what a cumulative
 
02:07:37.609 --> 02:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
impact analysis could be and then
 
02:07:39.530 --> 02:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
certainly answer questions
 
02:07:42.229 --> 02:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
so one of the first places we ever hear
 
02:07:44.270 --> 02:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
about cumulative impact is at our local
 
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
permit hearings in communities this is
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
often an area that local citizens will
 
02:07:50.450 --> 02:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
bring up because they feel it's an area
 
02:07:52.550 --> 02:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
where we may not necessarily have the
 
02:07:54.109 --> 02:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
regulatory scheme to address all
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
everything they would like to be
 
02:07:57.890 --> 02:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
addressed in terms of our reviews of
 
02:07:59.350 --> 02:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
that process
 
02:08:02.570 --> 02:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
EPA has developed uh under what they
 
02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
call environmental justice a number of
 
02:08:07.850 --> 02:08:07.860 align:start position:0%
guidance memos on looking at cumulative
 
02:08:10.850 --> 02:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
impact it's not very well defined at the
 
02:08:12.530 --> 02:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
federal level there are no federal
 
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
regulations there's just guidance that
 
02:08:16.850 --> 02:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
states should try to implement it
 
02:08:18.350 --> 02:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
through their environmental justice
 
02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:19.729 align:start position:0%
through their environmental justice
programs

02:08:19.729 --> 02:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:08:22.010 --> 02:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
the CDC center for the Disease Control
 
02:08:24.530 --> 02:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
recently put out a tool they call their
 
02:08:27.290 --> 02:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
environmental justice index and within
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
that system it's an online system where
 
02:08:31.370 --> 02:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
you could go in type an address and it
 
02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
tries to rank 36 different environmental
 
02:08:37.310 --> 02:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
Public Health factors to come up with an
 
02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
assessment of what type of cumulative
 
02:08:41.689 --> 02:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
impact is in that community
 
02:08:44.510 --> 02:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
there are a number of states across the
 
02:08:46.070 --> 02:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
country that are looking at cumulative
 
02:08:48.530 --> 02:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
impact analyzes and some are working
 
02:08:50.570 --> 02:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
either in their permitting processes or
 
02:08:52.850 --> 02:08:52.860 align:start position:0%
their rulemaking or actually have state
 
02:08:55.070 --> 02:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
statutes that require some sort of
 
02:08:57.709 --> 02:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
cumulative impact analysis some of those
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
states around us include Massachusetts
 
02:09:02.450 --> 02:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
New Jersey Minnesota California and I'm
 
02:09:03.950 --> 02:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
sure there's a number of other states
 
02:09:05.689 --> 02:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
again a lot of attention at the federal
 
02:09:05.699 --> 02:09:06.890 align:start position:0%
again a lot of attention at the federal
level

02:09:06.890 --> 02:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:09:09.050 --> 02:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
at the state level and at also the local
 
02:09:09.060 --> 02:09:10.910 align:start position:0%
at the state level and at also the local
level

02:09:10.910 --> 02:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:09:13.609 --> 02:09:13.619 align:start position:0%
a couple quick examples of what
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
cumulative impact analyzes could be a
 
02:09:19.550 --> 02:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
simple example on the air side is under
 
02:09:23.629 --> 02:09:23.639 align:start position:0%
RSA 125i we have a state air toxics
 
02:09:25.850 --> 02:09:25.860 align:start position:0%
program where we regulate over 600 a
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
toxics under that regulation and it's
 
02:09:33.229 --> 02:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
implementing rules enva 1400 we
 
02:09:35.810 --> 02:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
establish health-based standards for
 
02:09:37.850 --> 02:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
those chemicals and what the
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
requirements are under that rule and
 
02:09:42.229 --> 02:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
statute is that an individual facility
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
would need to demonstrate that at their
 
02:09:46.189 --> 02:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
property boundary
 
02:09:48.169 --> 02:09:48.179 align:start position:0%
through a tool we call Air dispersion
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
modeling that they're meeting that
 
02:09:52.010 --> 02:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
standard at their property boundary and
 
02:09:52.020 --> 02:09:53.270 align:start position:0%
standard at their property boundary and
Beyond

02:09:53.270 --> 02:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
Beyond
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
what the rule doesn't require is if you
 
02:09:58.129 --> 02:09:58.139 align:start position:0%
have two facilities located near each
 
02:10:00.109 --> 02:10:00.119 align:start position:0%
other they both need to demonstrate that
 
02:10:01.550 --> 02:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
they meet that standard at their
 
02:10:03.290 --> 02:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
respective property boundaries but it
 
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
does not look at where those emissions
 
02:10:09.649 --> 02:10:09.659 align:start position:0%
could interact off property so that's
 
02:10:12.530 --> 02:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
one easy example on a state side
 
02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:13.430 align:start position:0%
one easy example on a state side
um

02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:15.649 --> 02:10:15.659 align:start position:0%
a little more complicated on the air
 
02:10:18.169 --> 02:10:18.179 align:start position:0%
side would be a what I would call a
 
02:10:19.729 --> 02:10:19.739 align:start position:0%
combined analysis for different air
 
02:10:22.010 --> 02:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
toxics for example again we have a
 
02:10:23.930 --> 02:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
standard for I'm going to throw out the
 
02:10:26.990 --> 02:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
a toluene as one air toxics we have one
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
standard for Benzene a facility needs to
 
02:10:31.550 --> 02:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
demonstrate compliance with each one of
 
02:10:33.950 --> 02:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
those individual standards but we do not
 
02:10:36.770 --> 02:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
have a mechanism for say what if I'm a
 
02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
little bit below on this one a little
 
02:10:39.709 --> 02:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
bit below on that one what's the
 
02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
combined impact right now we do not
 
02:10:43.550 --> 02:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
require that analysis under the
 
02:10:46.729 --> 02:10:46.739 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework that we have
 
02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
um and the ultimate this goal I think is
 
02:10:50.810 --> 02:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
Senate the senator mentioned is what is
 
02:10:53.209 --> 02:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
the potential impact of cumulative
 
02:10:55.970 --> 02:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
impacts on the environment in situations
 
02:10:58.850 --> 02:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
where you could have error emissions you
 
02:11:00.890 --> 02:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
could have what's in the water and we
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
drink the water we could have what's in
 
02:11:04.370 --> 02:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
the soil and how does that impact human
 
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
health as well that would be the
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
ultimate level of cumulative impact um
 
02:11:11.390 --> 02:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
I know there were some comments about
 
02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
this being a stripped down bear uh bill
 
02:11:16.729 --> 02:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
I would say that this is potentially a
 
02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
significant change to the regulatory
 
02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:20.149 align:start position:0%
significant change to the regulatory
framework

02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
framework
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
of house facilities are cited in New
 
02:11:25.970 --> 02:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it doesn't it is a very
 
02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
complicated science I think that
 
02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
November one date uh to give the is to
 
02:11:34.370 --> 02:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
give the department enough time to go
 
02:11:36.709 --> 02:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
out and look at what is being proposed
 
02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
in other states understand what they're
 
02:11:41.209 --> 02:11:41.219 align:start position:0%
doing how they're making the assessment
 
02:11:44.089 --> 02:11:44.099 align:start position:0%
of how do you measure the individual
 
02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
impacts of different things and what is
 
02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
the cumulative effect what is the
 
02:11:50.750 --> 02:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
science behind that we would need to
 
02:11:52.310 --> 02:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
consult internally with our
 
02:11:54.410 --> 02:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
environmental health program to try to
 
02:11:56.390 --> 02:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
get an understanding of that so there is
 
02:11:58.970 --> 02:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
a lot of work in my opinion that would
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
need to go into this have some
 
02:12:04.010 --> 02:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
reservations if you move that date up I
 
02:12:05.450 --> 02:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
want to make sure the department has
 
02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
time I understand the concern about
 
02:12:11.450 --> 02:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
timing of filing legislation though so
 
02:12:11.460 --> 02:12:13.669 align:start position:0%
timing of filing legislation though so
um

02:12:13.669 --> 02:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:13.679 --> 02:12:15.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:12:15.229 --> 02:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:18.050 --> 02:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
so I think in the bottom line is I think
 
02:12:19.729 --> 02:12:19.739 align:start position:0%
the department feels we didn't request
 
02:12:21.530 --> 02:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
this bill we're kind of neutral on it
 
02:12:23.570 --> 02:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
but if this is the path we want to go
 
02:12:25.370 --> 02:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
down as a policy for the State of New
 
02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:26.270 align:start position:0%
down as a policy for the State of New
Hampshire

02:12:26.270 --> 02:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
that I think doing a scoping study makes
 
02:12:32.450 --> 02:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense you can't go at this
 
02:12:34.669 --> 02:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
without a lot of sight foresight into
 
02:12:36.890 --> 02:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
what you're doing and you need to make
 
02:12:38.450 --> 02:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
sure you're using good science and
 
02:12:41.149 --> 02:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
understanding what we're doing I will
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
stress that if we are to go down this
 
02:12:46.129 --> 02:12:46.139 align:start position:0%
path we certainly need the staff person
 
02:12:48.310 --> 02:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
I do not have the staff right now
 
02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
necessary to undertake this we're
 
02:12:53.290 --> 02:12:53.300 align:start position:0%
extremely short staffed as a department
 
02:12:56.330 --> 02:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
and this is a whole new thing I will say
 
02:12:58.550 --> 02:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
I'm the air director but this position
 
02:13:00.290 --> 02:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
would be located probably in our
 
02:13:01.850 --> 02:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
environmental health program which is in
 
02:13:03.890 --> 02:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
the air division but it would really
 
02:13:05.750 --> 02:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
interact with the waste and water
 
02:13:08.510 --> 02:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
divisions as well so this is a thing
 
02:13:10.250 --> 02:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
that we do now with the environmental
 
02:13:12.350 --> 02:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
health program that's why we think that
 
02:13:13.490 --> 02:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
would be the right place to put this
 
02:13:14.930 --> 02:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
position that's probably more detail
 
02:13:17.030 --> 02:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
than you need to know but that's where
 
02:13:18.589 --> 02:13:18.599 align:start position:0%
we would likely do that so and with that
 
02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
I can certainly try to answer questions
 
02:13:22.569 --> 02:13:22.579 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just wanted to
 
02:13:29.390 --> 02:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
clarify uh thank you uh for taking my
 
02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:30.410 align:start position:0%
clarify uh thank you uh for taking my
question

02:13:30.410 --> 02:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:13:33.050 --> 02:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
um you did say that currently as it
 
02:13:35.390 --> 02:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
stands you are not required if I had
 
02:13:37.790 --> 02:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
have this correct to study the
 
02:13:40.189 --> 02:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
relationship of two separate substances
 
02:13:42.290 --> 02:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
yeah and how they interact with one
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
another yeah right now the the
 
02:13:46.430 --> 02:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework of the states uh
 
02:13:48.649 --> 02:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
air toxics regulation which is a pretty
 
02:13:51.050 --> 02:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
comprehensive regulation we look at
 
02:13:54.109 --> 02:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
compounds on an individual basis
 
02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:01.069 --> 02:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so um
 
02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
do you feel that the end that if you did
 
02:14:08.810 --> 02:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
not have uh this study the department
 
02:14:11.450 --> 02:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
would have any capacity to make rules
 
02:14:14.569 --> 02:14:14.579 align:start position:0%
based on cumulative impacts I would I
 
02:14:17.209 --> 02:14:17.219 align:start position:0%
would say we need to do this study okay
 
02:14:17.219 --> 02:14:22.490 align:start position:0%
would say we need to do this study okay
definitively

02:14:22.490 --> 02:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh my question is do you believe
 
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
if if we looked at this um November 2025
 
02:14:32.089 --> 02:14:32.099 align:start position:0%
date and even we're thinking of putting
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
that back to September 1st so that there
 
02:14:37.609 --> 02:14:37.619 align:start position:0%
would be some time for the house members
 
02:14:40.430 --> 02:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
to submit legislation
 
02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:41.930 align:start position:0%
to submit legislation
um

02:14:41.930 --> 02:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:43.970 --> 02:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
feel that that is an adequate amount of
 
02:14:47.390 --> 02:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
time to do this I mean it looks like
 
02:14:49.310 --> 02:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
you're gonna have to need some time to
 
02:14:52.129 --> 02:14:52.139 align:start position:0%
hire somebody to do it and then sit down
 
02:14:55.129 --> 02:14:55.139 align:start position:0%
and do the actual work that that's sorry
 
02:14:58.490 --> 02:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
so I'm just thinking do you do you think
 
02:15:00.530 --> 02:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
perhaps we should push it out an extra
 
02:15:04.189 --> 02:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
what's your thought on on time frame I I
 
02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
think when we originally thought about
 
02:15:11.209 --> 02:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
this we thought the November 1 time
 
02:15:14.209 --> 02:15:14.219 align:start position:0%
frame of 2025 was sufficient
 
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
to give us the opportunity like you say
 
02:15:18.290 --> 02:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
to create the position fill the position
 
02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
as you know it's incredibly difficult to
 
02:15:22.330 --> 02:15:22.340 align:start position:0%
fill positions in state government
 
02:15:24.770 --> 02:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
I think this would be an attractive
 
02:15:26.810 --> 02:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
position to somebody uh professionally
 
02:15:28.490 --> 02:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you because it's kind
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
of Cutting Edge so I I think we would be
 
02:15:33.470 --> 02:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
able to recruit somebody
 
02:15:35.330 --> 02:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
um I think I'm comfortable within
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
November of 25 date okay
 
02:15:39.890 --> 02:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
are you comfortable with a September
 
02:15:43.569 --> 02:15:43.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
but I mean I I want to make sure that we
 
02:15:50.689 --> 02:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
do the job correctly I mean in theory
 
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
um September 1 of 2025
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
assuming we have the position created by
 
02:15:58.250 --> 02:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
this September gives us two years so
 
02:15:58.260 --> 02:15:59.450 align:start position:0%
this September gives us two years so
okay

02:15:59.450 --> 02:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
if you told me I had to live with it I
 
02:16:03.770 --> 02:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
would make it work okay
 
02:16:06.109 --> 02:16:06.119 align:start position:0%
representative germano thank you madam
 
02:16:07.069 --> 02:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:16:09.169 --> 02:16:09.179 align:start position:0%
question I'm just curious in terms of I
 
02:16:11.450 --> 02:16:11.460 align:start position:0%
absolutely appreciate uh as you're
 
02:16:13.069 --> 02:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
saying how long it might take to to fill
 
02:16:15.050 --> 02:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
a position but I'm wondering are there
 
02:16:17.870 --> 02:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
regulatory models that you know of
 
02:16:20.810 --> 02:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
already uh in in neighboring states for
 
02:16:25.790 --> 02:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
example uh that do model for uh multiple
 
02:16:28.370 --> 02:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
compounds in interaction in the scenario
 
02:16:30.770 --> 02:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
that you described so I know the state
 
02:16:32.810 --> 02:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
most closest state is the state of
 
02:16:35.209 --> 02:16:35.219 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is currently looking at a
 
02:16:37.250 --> 02:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
cumulative impact analysis but it's
 
02:16:39.410 --> 02:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
strictly on the air toxic side right now
 
02:16:42.049 --> 02:16:42.059 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily looking at air
 
02:16:43.929 --> 02:16:43.939 align:start position:0%
water and waste but that's the most
 
02:16:46.690 --> 02:16:46.700 align:start position:0%
closest one I think there's still about
 
02:16:48.770 --> 02:16:48.780 align:start position:0%
they're probably a year into their
 
02:16:50.750 --> 02:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process and I think they plan
 
02:16:52.370 --> 02:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
to finish by the end of this year so
 
02:16:54.410 --> 02:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
it's about a two-year process for them
 
02:16:56.030 --> 02:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair any
 
02:16:59.330 --> 02:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Bixby so
 
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
um would you invit do you envision this
 
02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
position being there for the two years
 
02:17:07.490 --> 02:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
that we that that are allotted in this
 
02:17:09.410 --> 02:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
bill and then disappearing or do you see
 
02:17:11.330 --> 02:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
this as something that would be an
 
02:17:13.810 --> 02:17:13.820 align:start position:0%
ongoing uh
 
02:17:16.009 --> 02:17:16.019 align:start position:0%
an ongoing piece of work in the
 
02:17:18.410 --> 02:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
department I would cons I would most
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
likely think it would be an ongoing
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
piece of work in the department so cons
 
02:17:25.009 --> 02:17:25.019 align:start position:0%
follow up yep so conceivably we could
 
02:17:27.770 --> 02:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
have a report out date of September 1st
 
02:17:31.190 --> 02:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
2025 and then we would could expect
 
02:17:33.530 --> 02:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
further reports
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
um on a so semi-annual or annual Justice
 
02:17:39.169 --> 02:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
absolutely and that would allow us and
 
02:17:41.509 --> 02:17:41.519 align:start position:0%
then so you know the the whole work may
 
02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
not be done by September uh 2025 but uh
 
02:17:49.009 --> 02:17:49.019 align:start position:0%
that may be a point at which you know a
 
02:17:50.750 --> 02:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
few things would be recognized that okay
 
02:17:53.450 --> 02:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
we need to do legislation on this yes I
 
02:17:56.990 --> 02:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:59.690 --> 02:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:03.530 --> 02:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing none I now call Roger
 
02:18:06.770 --> 02:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
Stevenson to come and testify
 
02:18:08.750 --> 02:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill and you
 
02:18:15.889 --> 02:18:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:15.899 --> 02:18:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
that's

02:18:17.750 --> 02:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:18:23.570 --> 02:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:25.730 --> 02:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
my name is Roger Stevenson I live in
 
02:18:27.230 --> 02:18:27.240 align:start position:0%

UCS supports 267 with one change to the
timeline

02:18:46.969 --> 02:18:46.979 align:start position:0%
timeline
 
02:18:48.589 --> 02:18:48.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to tell you there is
 
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
science to sue to support
 
02:18:54.169 --> 02:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 267. it's well known and
 
02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
documented that people are exposed to
 
02:18:57.709 --> 02:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
multiple chemicals at once
 
02:19:00.049 --> 02:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
not one at a time from a single Source
 
02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
the way many environmental regulatory
 
02:19:04.490 --> 02:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
rules are written
 
02:19:07.310 --> 02:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
we're exposed to pollutants by breathing
 
02:19:10.250 --> 02:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
eating and by touch with our skin
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
this means that there needs to be cross
 
02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:13.310 align:start position:0%
this means that there needs to be cross
linkages

02:19:13.310 --> 02:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
linkages
 
02:19:15.169 --> 02:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
in environmental permitting between
 
02:19:19.849 --> 02:19:19.859 align:start position:0%
water air and the soil for example
 
02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
exposures to mixtures of chemicals
 
02:19:24.290 --> 02:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
versus single chemicals can produce
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
different or Worse impacts
 
02:19:30.490 --> 02:19:30.500 align:start position:0%
there is a scientific approach
 
02:19:33.410 --> 02:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
informing how to combine qualitative
 
02:19:35.870 --> 02:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
data such as information and feedback
 
02:19:38.089 --> 02:19:38.099 align:start position:0%
from communities
 
02:19:40.429 --> 02:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
and quantitative data such as numbers
 
02:19:43.129 --> 02:19:43.139 align:start position:0%
and measurements this approach has been
 
02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
evolving since the 80s and provides
 
02:19:49.130 --> 02:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
support to implement this bill and we
 
02:19:50.830 --> 02:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
would encourage
 
02:19:53.690 --> 02:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
if the department were to undergo a
 
02:19:57.290 --> 02:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
scoping study that members of different
 
02:20:00.290 --> 02:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
communities were included in that
 
02:20:03.290 --> 02:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
analysis on a qualitative basis
 
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
so what does this mean well I think
 
02:20:07.190 --> 02:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
you've already heard that New
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's environmental regulatory
 
02:20:12.050 --> 02:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
system needs to reflect these realities
 
02:20:16.570 --> 02:20:16.580 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 267 is a critical First Step
 
02:20:18.889 --> 02:20:18.899 align:start position:0%
because right now we have a regulatory
 
02:20:20.570 --> 02:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
system that has not evolved to address
 
02:20:22.690 --> 02:20:22.700 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
we recommend the timeline be changed and
 
02:20:29.889 --> 02:20:29.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:34.310 --> 02:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
to November 2024. we asked that the
 
02:20:36.110 --> 02:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
timeline for reporting and assessment be
 
02:20:39.050 --> 02:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
reduced mapping tools ample data
 
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
examples from other states experiences
 
02:20:44.210 --> 02:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
are available for the Department to
 
02:20:46.250 --> 02:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
modify and supplement in order to report
 
02:20:48.770 --> 02:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
findings and propose any proposed
 
02:20:50.990 --> 02:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
legislation or rule making well before
 
02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
November first 2025.
 
02:20:57.710 --> 02:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
we should not have to wait two years
 
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:00.720 align:start position:0%

the cumulative risks and impacts

02:21:39.950 --> 02:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
documents that include consideration of
 
02:21:41.690 --> 02:21:41.700 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts
 
02:21:43.969 --> 02:21:43.979 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
02:21:47.210 --> 02:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
and I've included three blog posts from
 
02:21:49.370 --> 02:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
a colleague Christy ellickson an expert
 
02:21:53.929 --> 02:21:53.939 align:start position:0%
in cumulative impacts on the last page
 
02:21:57.650 --> 02:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming to testify on this
 
02:22:05.929 --> 02:22:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:10.730 --> 02:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:12.050 --> 02:22:12.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:22:14.630 --> 02:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
good morning chair Aaron and honorable
 
02:22:16.670 --> 02:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is Noah
 
02:22:19.730 --> 02:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
Bosworth and I am the relatively new
 
02:22:21.530 --> 02:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
zero waste staff attorney for the
 
02:22:24.710 --> 02:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
conservation law Foundation
 
02:22:27.770 --> 02:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
we are here to enthusiastically support
 
02:22:30.730 --> 02:22:30.740 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
the while the science behind cumulative
 
02:22:36.290 --> 02:22:36.300 align:start position:0%
impacts analysis or assessment can be
 
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
complex the reason for having this bill
 
02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
in the first place is quite simple which
 
02:22:44.270 --> 02:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
is that a facility individually on its
 
02:22:46.670 --> 02:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
own May satisfy permitting requirements
 
02:22:50.090 --> 02:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
and not pose a clear risk of harm but
 
02:22:52.250 --> 02:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
when multiple facilities and sources of
 
02:22:54.110 --> 02:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
pollution affect a community the
 
02:22:56.510 --> 02:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
cumulative impact impacts can become
 
02:22:58.190 --> 02:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
quite harmful
 
02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
we do like others uh urge the uh
 
02:23:06.050 --> 02:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
timeline to be a bit shorter we would
 
02:23:08.270 --> 02:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
argue that the commissioner should
 
02:23:10.250 --> 02:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
report the findings six months earlier
 
02:23:13.250 --> 02:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
by May 2025
 
02:23:16.210 --> 02:23:16.220 align:start position:0%
and as has been stated
 
02:23:18.770 --> 02:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
the agency does not have to reinvent the
 
02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
wheel here New Jersey Massachusetts and
 
02:23:23.410 --> 02:23:23.420 align:start position:0%
New York have all
 
02:23:27.530 --> 02:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
begun or already implemented uh
 
02:23:32.410 --> 02:23:32.420 align:start position:0%
laws that have resulted in similar
 
02:23:35.389 --> 02:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
regulations as this agency would be
 
02:23:36.910 --> 02:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
looking into
 
02:23:36.920 --> 02:23:38.590 align:start position:0%
looking into
and

02:23:38.590 --> 02:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:41.929 --> 02:23:41.939 align:start position:0%
we believe that particularly because
 
02:23:45.410 --> 02:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
that initial report would be the first
 
02:23:49.370 --> 02:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
of an ongoing series of reports it is
 
02:23:53.690 --> 02:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
feasible and valuable to create a
 
02:23:55.550 --> 02:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
shorter timeline that would result in
 
02:23:57.290 --> 02:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
really thoughtful legislation being on
 
02:23:58.690 --> 02:23:58.700 align:start position:0%
the table
 
02:24:02.210 --> 02:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
by September 2025.
 
02:24:06.730 --> 02:24:06.740 align:start position:0%
so I'm keeping it short and I just
 
02:24:09.650 --> 02:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
full-heartedly support this legislation
 
02:24:13.309 --> 02:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
and I urge the committee to vote ought
 
02:24:15.290 --> 02:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
02:24:18.490 --> 02:24:18.500 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
02:24:21.410 --> 02:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
sure representative Murray go ahead
 
02:24:23.450 --> 02:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair could we just have
 
02:24:25.490 --> 02:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
either an electronic copy of your
 
02:24:27.889 --> 02:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
statements or a copy or is that just
 
02:24:30.530 --> 02:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
general notes or so I will be testifying
 
02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
later on SB 61 and I have plenty of
 
02:24:35.450 --> 02:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
copies but I um we decided that I would
 
02:24:37.010 --> 02:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
only testify oily on this particular
 
02:24:39.290 --> 02:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
bill thank you
 
02:24:42.770 --> 02:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions or comments on
 
02:24:42.780 --> 02:24:44.030 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions or comments on
this

02:24:44.030 --> 02:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:50.990 --> 02:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
is anybody else wish to speak on this
 
02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:52.370 align:start position:0%
is anybody else wish to speak on this
bill

02:24:52.370 --> 02:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
on SB 267.
 
02:24:57.889 --> 02:24:57.899 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm looking for the blue
 
02:25:01.330 --> 02:25:01.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:06.770 --> 02:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
online so the uh online portal says 53
 
02:25:08.929 --> 02:25:08.939 align:start position:0%
support one neutral
 
02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:20.450 --> 02:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
you have one person signed up in support
 
02:25:26.030 --> 02:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:28.130 --> 02:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
since there's no further comment on this
 
02:25:31.630 --> 02:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
I am going to close the hearing on sb267
 
02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in to uh testify
 
02:25:38.750 --> 02:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
and introduce this bill today
 
02:25:42.889 --> 02:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
we are now going to take a recessive
 
02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
break until
 
02:25:50.210 --> 02:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
12 30 when we will be hearing SB 62
 
02:25:53.650 --> 02:25:53.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:56.090 --> 02:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
we would have one announcement real
 
02:25:56.100 --> 02:25:57.050 align:start position:0%
we would have one announcement real
quick

02:25:57.050 --> 02:25:57.060 align:start position:0%
quick
 
02:26:01.010 --> 02:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair on uh SB 159
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
the landfill uh permit committee there
 
02:26:07.490 --> 02:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
were 58 people online that were
 
02:26:10.610 --> 02:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
supportive with zero against I I missed
 
02:26:13.450 --> 02:26:13.460 align:start position:0%
that last time okay sure
 
02:26:18.230 --> 02:26:18.240 align:start position:0%

02:29:28.969 --> 02:29:28.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:28.979 --> 02:30:25.849 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:30:25.849 --> 02:30:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:27.650 --> 02:30:27.660 align:start position:0%
a little shot
 
02:30:27.660 --> 02:30:49.010 align:start position:0%
a little shot
please

02:30:49.010 --> 02:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:49.020 --> 02:31:32.510 align:start position:0%
 
legislation

02:31:32.510 --> 02:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:32.520 --> 02:31:58.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:31:58.150 --> 02:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:39.349 --> 03:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:41.630 --> 03:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
we would do some things not everything
 
03:16:44.030 --> 03:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
you want but and we're concerned about
 
03:16:44.040 --> 03:16:45.230 align:start position:0%
you want but and we're concerned about
the

03:16:45.230 --> 03:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:16:48.590 --> 03:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
how robust the process is
 
03:16:50.650 --> 03:16:50.660 align:start position:0%
we know it's perfectly fine
 
03:16:53.690 --> 03:16:53.700 align:start position:0%
independent outside somebody that knows
 
03:16:55.490 --> 03:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
about the same history that's not tied
 
03:16:55.500 --> 03:16:56.570 align:start position:0%
about the same history that's not tied
to

03:16:56.570 --> 03:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:16:59.150 --> 03:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have a financial interest in
 
03:17:02.030 --> 03:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
confidence here we're uh we're very
 
03:17:03.590 --> 03:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
interested in
 
03:17:06.230 --> 03:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
Public Schools but I think if we could
 
03:17:08.269 --> 03:17:08.279 align:start position:0%
live with this if it was if it's an
 
03:17:08.279 --> 03:17:09.230 align:start position:0%
live with this if it was if it's an
event

03:17:09.230 --> 03:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
event
 
03:17:11.870 --> 03:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
but uh like everything else it's not
 
03:17:14.210 --> 03:17:14.220 align:start position:0%
like to get anywhere
 
03:17:16.370 --> 03:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
being willing to give me that I think
 
03:17:18.769 --> 03:17:18.779 align:start position:0%
the dentist will probably be supportive
 
03:17:25.630 --> 03:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:28.730 --> 03:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
yes yeah
 
03:17:30.889 --> 03:17:30.899 align:start position:0%
I never in a million years thought I
 
03:17:33.410 --> 03:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
came from a testified for solid waste
 
03:17:37.910 --> 03:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:40.610 --> 03:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
so the two things that you know we just
 
03:17:43.070 --> 03:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
think conflict of interest is a concern
 
03:17:46.010 --> 03:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
and uh the weather feels really it's not
 
03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
like we're we've got garbage lining up
 
03:17:50.510 --> 03:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
unless we've got plenty of capacity so
 
03:17:52.670 --> 03:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
let's just let the study play out and
 
03:18:00.010 --> 03:18:00.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:02.090 --> 03:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
we'll just see how
 
03:18:04.150 --> 03:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
open their hearts into that
 
03:18:06.170 --> 03:18:06.180 align:start position:0%
unfortunately working back and we're
 
03:18:08.450 --> 03:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
talking to people
 
03:18:11.750 --> 03:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
so we'll see yeah it's a
 
03:18:16.670 --> 03:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:19.250 --> 03:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
but we're you know unfortunate we have a
 
03:18:21.349 --> 03:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
lot of people who like to tell me I
 
03:18:26.510 --> 03:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:28.250 --> 03:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
it's so it's one of those things we have
 
03:18:32.889 --> 03:18:32.899 align:start position:0%
to just it's a PowerPoint I love it yeah
 
03:18:38.450 --> 03:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:38.460 --> 03:18:40.370 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:18:40.370 --> 03:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:18:42.670 --> 03:18:42.680 align:start position:0%
energy around them
 
03:18:45.950 --> 03:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think we've learned that
 
03:18:45.960 --> 03:18:48.110 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think we've learned that
uh

03:18:48.110 --> 03:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:18:49.969 --> 03:18:49.979 align:start position:0%
a lot of it isn't the Merit of the bill
 
03:18:52.190 --> 03:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
it's the politics and behind it you know
 
03:18:54.110 --> 03:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
and we're fighting things that we don't
 
03:18:57.050 --> 03:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
even understand I don't know why it's a
 
03:18:59.150 --> 03:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
new production support the environment
 
03:19:02.690 --> 03:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
but he's he's a smart guy
 
03:19:04.790 --> 03:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
I think it would be a feather in his cap
 
03:19:07.670 --> 03:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
and say you know I think one of these
 
03:19:07.680 --> 03:19:19.610 align:start position:0%
and say you know I think one of these
speakers

to an age and we have to be careful
 
03:20:08.889 --> 03:20:08.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:11.990 --> 03:20:12.000 align:start position:0%

03:20:33.769 --> 03:20:33.779 align:start position:0%
another story about how dangerous
 
03:20:35.630 --> 03:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
and it's not the way it's involved I
 
03:20:36.969 --> 03:20:36.979 align:start position:0%
mean it's just what's in all the product
 
03:20:39.889 --> 03:20:39.899 align:start position:0%
but they're the ones who want to
 
03:20:43.150 --> 03:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
build another one of these behemoth Y
 
03:20:46.429 --> 03:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
and what really pisses most of us off
 
03:20:48.710 --> 03:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's this would never go in it
 
03:20:50.750 --> 03:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't promising internship it wasn't
 
03:20:53.570 --> 03:20:53.580 align:start position:0%

this bill cleaning up a drafting error
 
03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's been sitting in statute for about
 
03:31:43.729 --> 03:31:43.739 align:start position:0%
a decade this law ensures that
 
03:31:46.130 --> 03:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
landowners are not liable for pollution
 
03:31:49.309 --> 03:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
on their land caused by God war or

somebody else
 
03:31:52.610 --> 03:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
we should hold polluters responsible for

their actions but not punish innocent
 
03:31:57.229 --> 03:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
landowners for acts of third parties
 
03:31:59.570 --> 03:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
existing law refers to hazardous
 
03:32:01.729 --> 03:32:01.739 align:start position:0%
substances but should more accurately
 
03:32:04.130 --> 03:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
reference hazardous waste or hazardous
 
03:32:07.190 --> 03:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
materials sb62 also replaces a few
 
03:32:09.469 --> 03:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
pronouns with proper nouns to prevent
 
03:32:11.690 --> 03:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
any confusion on who is meant by the
 
03:32:14.389 --> 03:32:14.399 align:start position:0%

language that has been an error in the

um the term hazardous substance was used
 
03:33:58.550 --> 03:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
in some places where really it should
 
03:34:00.290 --> 03:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
have said hazardous waste and hazardous

03:34:01.729 --> 03:34:01.739 align:start position:0%
materials
 
03:34:03.469 --> 03:34:03.479 align:start position:0%
um and and that is what we're seeking to
 
03:34:05.929 --> 03:34:05.939 align:start position:0%
fix with this bill how's this substance
 
03:34:08.210 --> 03:34:08.220 align:start position:0%
is not defined in the statute and in
 
03:34:10.190 --> 03:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
fact it has some important meanings in
 
03:34:12.290 --> 03:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
other state and federal laws but it
 
03:34:14.210 --> 03:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
really doesn't have a place in this
 
03:34:18.530 --> 03:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
particular section of the law so its use
 
03:34:20.330 --> 03:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
is really just misplaced here and needs
 
03:34:20.340 --> 03:34:21.309 align:start position:0%
is really just misplaced here and needs
correction

03:34:21.309 --> 03:34:21.319 align:start position:0%
correction
 
03:34:23.809 --> 03:34:23.819 align:start position:0%
none of these changes as Mr bossy
 
03:34:26.269 --> 03:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
indicated changed the meaning or the
 
03:34:29.269 --> 03:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
principal intent of this law but it will
 
03:34:31.190 --> 03:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
serve to avoid confusion in the future
 
03:34:33.530 --> 03:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
application of the law and with that
 
03:34:35.269 --> 03:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it there and be happy to take
 
03:34:37.910 --> 03:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
any questions great
 
03:34:41.090 --> 03:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:34:43.729 --> 03:34:43.739 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much I
 
03:34:47.210 --> 03:34:47.220 align:start position:0%
appreciate you coming to explain this to
 
03:34:50.269 --> 03:34:50.279 align:start position:0%
us thank you
 
03:34:52.849 --> 03:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
all right is there anyone else who would
 
03:34:56.150 --> 03:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
like to speak on SB 62
 
03:34:58.849 --> 03:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
seeing none yes thank you for passing up
 
03:35:02.210 --> 03:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet one and one
 
03:35:04.130 --> 03:35:04.140 align:start position:0%
um we had one in support and one in
 
03:35:07.130 --> 03:35:07.140 align:start position:0%
opposition on the online portal
 
03:35:11.630 --> 03:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:14.330 --> 03:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm going to close out the
 
03:35:17.990 --> 03:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
hearing on SB 62 that was short and
 
03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:21.530 align:start position:0%
hearing on SB 62 that was short and
sweet

03:35:21.530 --> 03:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:23.809 --> 03:35:23.819 align:start position:0%
and give that to you
 
03:35:23.819 --> 03:35:25.610 align:start position:0%
and give that to you
and

03:35:25.610 --> 03:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:29.990 --> 03:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
um in about 10 minutes we will continue
 
03:35:32.990 --> 03:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
I can't start before then
 
03:35:37.010 --> 03:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
um we will continue with SB 61 for the
 
03:44:27.170 --> 03:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:08.809 --> 03:45:08.819 align:start position:0%
all right um we have a 12 45 now and I
 
03:45:11.630 --> 03:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
would like to open up the hearing on SB
 
03:45:11.640 --> 03:45:13.130 align:start position:0%
would like to open up the hearing on SB
61.

03:45:13.130 --> 03:45:13.140 align:start position:0%
61.
 
03:45:15.710 --> 03:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
and in here today this afternoon to
 
03:45:17.690 --> 03:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill is Senator David
 
03:45:19.729 --> 03:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
Waters welcome to environment
 
03:45:22.490 --> 03:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
agriculture well thank you so much Madam
 
03:45:23.929 --> 03:45:23.939 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee uh
 
03:45:25.910 --> 03:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
Senator David Waters District Four and
 
03:45:28.849 --> 03:45:28.859 align:start position:0%
I'm here for Senator avard is not here
 
03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
today and uh so since he and I are the
 
03:45:32.870 --> 03:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors on this legislation I'm very
 
03:45:37.550 --> 03:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
happy to uh to introduce the bill and
 
03:45:39.110 --> 03:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
um you know I'd like to walk through
 
03:45:40.849 --> 03:45:40.859 align:start position:0%
some of the visions and certainly we
 
03:45:43.309 --> 03:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
have uh Des folks here and others to
 
03:45:45.469 --> 03:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
address some of the technical process
 
03:45:47.030 --> 03:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's envisioned here in terms of the
 
03:45:48.590 --> 03:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
rulemaking that will be undertaken for
 
03:45:50.870 --> 03:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
the landfill setbacks but
 
03:45:52.490 --> 03:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
um I would like to start by just noting
 
03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
where we are and that
 
03:45:56.929 --> 03:45:56.939 align:start position:0%
um this issue uh is of extraordinary
 
03:45:58.910 --> 03:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
importance to the legislature and to the
 
03:46:01.250 --> 03:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire and I and I do
 
03:46:02.929 --> 03:46:02.939 align:start position:0%
think that we have actually made a lot
 
03:46:04.969 --> 03:46:04.979 align:start position:0%
of progress over the last few years we
 
03:46:08.210 --> 03:46:08.220 align:start position:0%
we did the 10-year uh plan we've got the
 
03:46:10.370 --> 03:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
solid way study committee for all the
 
03:46:11.809 --> 03:46:11.819 align:start position:0%
source reduction work that we have to do
 
03:46:14.269 --> 03:46:14.279 align:start position:0%
and we have been trying very hard over
 
03:46:16.250 --> 03:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
the last couple of sessions to do
 
03:46:18.710 --> 03:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
something about citing and setback rules
 
03:46:21.410 --> 03:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
and uh you know we were all deeply
 
03:46:22.790 --> 03:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
involved or most of us here and
 
03:46:25.969 --> 03:46:25.979 align:start position:0%
certainly in the senate in 1454
 
03:46:27.650 --> 03:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
um you made changes to that bill we made
 
03:46:29.690 --> 03:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
changes to that bill and it passed and I
 
03:46:33.469 --> 03:46:33.479 align:start position:0%
got vetoed and so what uh has been done
 
03:46:35.690 --> 03:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
since that time in both bodies with
 
03:46:37.969 --> 03:46:37.979 align:start position:0%
House Bill 56 which I also co-sponsored
 
03:46:40.990 --> 03:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
in this one I've tried to understand
 
03:46:43.910 --> 03:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
what that process taught us and how it
 
03:46:45.229 --> 03:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
can move forward because I think there's
 
03:46:47.870 --> 03:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
a deeply shared commitment uh in the
 
03:46:49.490 --> 03:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
Senate with you all that we've got to do
 
03:46:51.830 --> 03:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
something we really we do have to
 
03:46:54.950 --> 03:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
address this issue and um so I am
 
03:46:56.510 --> 03:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
presenting you what is the Senate
 
03:46:58.729 --> 03:46:58.739 align:start position:0%
position on it and I I wanted to
 
03:47:00.290 --> 03:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
emphasize that kind of shared purpose
 
03:47:01.729 --> 03:47:01.739 align:start position:0%
here and the desire to get something
 
03:47:03.650 --> 03:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
done this session because if you look
 
03:47:06.170 --> 03:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
through the purpose statement and a lot
 
03:47:07.610 --> 03:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
of the principles in this you're going
 
03:47:09.170 --> 03:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
to see things that are actually very
 
03:47:12.290 --> 03:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
similar to what was in House Bill 56 I
 
03:47:14.750 --> 03:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
mean who who Among Us would disagree
 
03:47:17.150 --> 03:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
protection of perennial rivers lakes and
 
03:47:19.130 --> 03:47:19.140 align:start position:0%
Coastal Waters from contamination is in
 
03:47:20.570 --> 03:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
the public interest of the State of New
 
03:47:22.250 --> 03:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mean that that's why we're
 
03:47:24.950 --> 03:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
here that's why we have these these
 
03:47:27.229 --> 03:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
bills and then starting on line seven
 
03:47:29.690 --> 03:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
and eight the purpose here is to
 
03:47:33.110 --> 03:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
establish site-specific setbacks and
 
03:47:35.330 --> 03:47:35.340 align:start position:0%
that's again what we recognize is what
 
03:47:38.210 --> 03:47:38.220 align:start position:0%
we must do moving forward and again both
 
03:47:40.070 --> 03:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
bills have that's basically the
 
03:47:42.290 --> 03:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
principles that they have um started
 
03:47:46.010 --> 03:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
from and uh you know certainly we know
 
03:47:47.690 --> 03:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
from the hard experience we've had with
 
03:47:50.090 --> 03:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
pbass that we have to have all hands on
 
03:47:52.010 --> 03:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
decked in the legislature and then you
 
03:47:54.650 --> 03:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
know certainly DES in developing the
 
03:47:56.990 --> 03:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
rules and procedures and the limits that
 
03:47:58.670 --> 03:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
have been developed for p fast that show
 
03:48:02.269 --> 03:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
so we we can do this we can do this um I
 
03:48:03.889 --> 03:48:03.899 align:start position:0%
think for this as well because we know
 
03:48:07.490 --> 03:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
we've done it in other areas as well
 
03:48:10.130 --> 03:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
now um just to start going through a
 
03:48:12.229 --> 03:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
little bit of the of again the findings
 
03:48:14.030 --> 03:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
um do note
 
03:48:17.210 --> 03:48:17.220 align:start position:0%
um that the hydrological investigation
 
03:48:20.210 --> 03:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
that's one thing that came very clear to
 
03:48:23.210 --> 03:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
me through 1454. we don't have the
 
03:48:25.610 --> 03:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
science and sometimes understand
 
03:48:28.130 --> 03:48:28.140 align:start position:0%
the the groundwater we I think we're
 
03:48:31.190 --> 03:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
pretty good on runoff but groundwater we
 
03:48:33.889 --> 03:48:33.899 align:start position:0%
don't know groundwater flows and the
 
03:48:36.590 --> 03:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
issue of how far a setback should be and
 
03:48:38.690 --> 03:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
what is the permeability and how fast
 
03:48:40.790 --> 03:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
contaminants might potentially move and
 
03:48:42.590 --> 03:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
what are the mitigation things all that
 
03:48:45.710 --> 03:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
needs to be termed by this hydrological
 
03:48:48.710 --> 03:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
study um and um
 
03:48:52.010 --> 03:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
but regardless the 200 foot setback is
 
03:48:54.229 --> 03:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
preserved in this this bill as a
 
03:48:56.570 --> 03:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
Baseline and then the setback from that
 
03:49:00.170 --> 03:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
is what this bill uh is is about and um
 
03:49:02.269 --> 03:49:02.279 align:start position:0%
if you continue on on the page
 
03:49:04.910 --> 03:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh two
 
03:49:04.920 --> 03:49:05.630 align:start position:0%
uh two
um

03:49:05.630 --> 03:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:08.389 --> 03:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
kind of setting the context of what are
 
03:49:10.309 --> 03:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
the most protective methods we need and
 
03:49:12.130 --> 03:49:12.140 align:start position:0%
how we're going to get there
 
03:49:16.969 --> 03:49:16.979 align:start position:0%
in rule making again as in 56 the
 
03:49:19.309 --> 03:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
principle here starting in lines 10 and
 
03:49:21.950 --> 03:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
10 through 12 on page two
 
03:49:23.929 --> 03:49:23.939 align:start position:0%
um that there may be design features
 
03:49:26.090 --> 03:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
that are needed to increase redundancy
 
03:49:27.950 --> 03:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
yes I think there's a lot of broad
 
03:49:30.050 --> 03:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
agreement on that that you know that
 
03:49:31.550 --> 03:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
there are new techniques and new
 
03:49:33.530 --> 03:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
methodologies and design features that
 
03:49:35.570 --> 03:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
that can help out here and we want to
 
03:49:37.670 --> 03:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that's part of this
 
03:49:41.809 --> 03:49:41.819 align:start position:0%
consideration as as well then the
 
03:49:43.429 --> 03:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
approach that the Senate has taken is to
 
03:49:45.290 --> 03:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
do the is to do as part of rulemaking
 
03:49:48.830 --> 03:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
rather than preemptively setting the
 
03:49:52.429 --> 03:49:52.439 align:start position:0%
requirements for this which was the
 
03:49:54.410 --> 03:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
methodology that was vetoed by the
 
03:49:57.170 --> 03:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
governor so you'll see starting on lines
 
03:49:59.450 --> 03:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
26 uh again this should look quite
 
03:50:01.849 --> 03:50:01.859 align:start position:0%
similar to what was in
 
03:50:04.550 --> 03:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 56 because it's these very
 
03:50:06.410 --> 03:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
categories that we're being used in
 
03:50:08.809 --> 03:50:08.819 align:start position:0%
terms of deciding what kind of
 
03:50:11.150 --> 03:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
variations in the time frame might be
 
03:50:14.050 --> 03:50:14.060 align:start position:0%
permitted in the sighting as well so
 
03:50:17.750 --> 03:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
travel time of groundwater in line 27 I
 
03:50:19.670 --> 03:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
mean that's very much at the heart of
 
03:50:21.650 --> 03:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
the bills that both of our bodies um
 
03:50:23.870 --> 03:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
have have had
 
03:50:25.550 --> 03:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
and then down at the bottom of the page
 
03:50:27.590 --> 03:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
again now in the rule making that
 
03:50:30.469 --> 03:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
statute about what are greater and more
 
03:50:34.370 --> 03:50:34.380 align:start position:0%
redundant protections uh for perennial
 
03:50:37.130 --> 03:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
um Waters and that continues on to page
 
03:50:39.769 --> 03:50:39.779 align:start position:0%
three uh these again shall look quite
 
03:50:41.090 --> 03:50:41.100 align:start position:0%
familiar they're the kinds of things
 
03:50:45.290 --> 03:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
that house bill 56 had as as well about
 
03:50:47.150 --> 03:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
the kind of redundancies and
 
03:50:51.370 --> 03:50:51.380 align:start position:0%
technologies that can be used there
 
03:50:54.710 --> 03:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
and then getting into the procedures of
 
03:50:57.050 --> 03:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
then after the rules are made how will
 
03:51:00.469 --> 03:51:00.479 align:start position:0%
the department actually deal with
 
03:51:02.830 --> 03:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
applications and
 
03:51:06.830 --> 03:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
this starts down in section five
 
03:51:10.849 --> 03:51:10.859 align:start position:0%
um and uh the timelines there
 
03:51:14.870 --> 03:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
um and and so forth and then the
 
03:51:17.570 --> 03:51:17.580 align:start position:0%
criteria for review starting on page
 
03:51:20.450 --> 03:51:20.460 align:start position:0%
four which as you might expect the
 
03:51:22.849 --> 03:51:22.859 align:start position:0%
criteria here park back to those things
 
03:51:24.769 --> 03:51:24.779 align:start position:0%
that I've already pointed out about
 
03:51:28.389 --> 03:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
the bill uh already about uh
 
03:51:32.090 --> 03:51:32.100 align:start position:0%
recommendations on factors and criteria
 
03:51:34.250 --> 03:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
um and and so forth
 
03:51:36.110 --> 03:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
03:51:38.809 --> 03:51:38.819 align:start position:0%
I know of great interest here starts on
 
03:51:41.210 --> 03:51:41.220 align:start position:0%
Section six uh how long is this rule
 
03:51:42.889 --> 03:51:42.899 align:start position:0%
making gonna take
 
03:51:46.670 --> 03:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
can it get done uh in time and what
 
03:51:48.469 --> 03:51:48.479 align:start position:0%
happens if applications come in during
 
03:51:50.510 --> 03:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking period these are
 
03:51:51.950 --> 03:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
important issues they've been of
 
03:51:53.690 --> 03:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
importance to you they are they were to
 
03:51:55.910 --> 03:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
us we worked hard on this in the Senate
 
03:51:58.490 --> 03:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
with the Department to say okay what is
 
03:52:01.729 --> 03:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
a time frame that can actually work and
 
03:52:03.889 --> 03:52:03.899 align:start position:0%
we can have some assurance that the
 
03:52:06.469 --> 03:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
rules will be done in this time frame so
 
03:52:07.849 --> 03:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
there's not that trigger that if you
 
03:52:09.110 --> 03:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
don't do it in two years then somebody
 
03:52:11.090 --> 03:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
can be in under their old rules and we
 
03:52:13.030 --> 03:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
didn't want that we wanted to make sure
 
03:52:15.590 --> 03:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
that the rules got done and if a
 
03:52:17.389 --> 03:52:17.399 align:start position:0%
proposal came in during that two-year
 
03:52:20.150 --> 03:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
period it was held in advance
 
03:52:22.790 --> 03:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
and then had to be judged by these new
 
03:52:25.070 --> 03:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
rules now the question might still be
 
03:52:27.170 --> 03:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
out there will they really get it done
 
03:52:29.150 --> 03:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
and I would look back to the experience
 
03:52:31.309 --> 03:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
we just had with the rulemaking under
 
03:52:33.889 --> 03:52:33.899 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan you know that was a
 
03:52:36.590 --> 03:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
pretty hard deadline that representative
 
03:52:39.229 --> 03:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
Ebel and I put in that bill in 315 to
 
03:52:41.389 --> 03:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
get that done and they did it they did
 
03:52:43.790 --> 03:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
it and so I you'll hear you can ask that
 
03:52:45.710 --> 03:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
of the department but the reason we went
 
03:52:47.210 --> 03:52:47.220 align:start position:0%
with this time frame was the reason we
 
03:52:49.370 --> 03:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
went with holding who's in advance is
 
03:52:51.410 --> 03:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
our sense that this actually this can
 
03:52:55.670 --> 03:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
actually uh actually work so let me
 
03:53:00.290 --> 03:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
continue on if I may uh to page five
 
03:53:04.490 --> 03:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
and uh here again making very clear
 
03:53:06.950 --> 03:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
that uh proposal that's come in in these
 
03:53:09.769 --> 03:53:09.779 align:start position:0%
two years is held in advance and then uh
 
03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
it does say that if it's not done within
 
03:53:13.849 --> 03:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
24 months the rules aren't they can go
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
under the old rules
 
03:53:18.050 --> 03:53:18.060 align:start position:0%
I think this has to be there but
 
03:53:20.330 --> 03:53:20.340 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't I hope that never
 
03:53:20.340 --> 03:53:22.010 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't I hope that never
happens

03:53:22.010 --> 03:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
happens
 
03:53:24.110 --> 03:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
um then the last part of the section
 
03:53:28.130 --> 03:53:28.140 align:start position:0%
seven this was Senate Bill 227 which I
 
03:53:29.929 --> 03:53:29.939 align:start position:0%
introduced in response to the
 
03:53:31.790 --> 03:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
recognition that we did not have good
 
03:53:34.070 --> 03:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
groundwater studies and hydrological
 
03:53:36.889 --> 03:53:36.899 align:start position:0%
information and we decided to fold
 
03:53:40.849 --> 03:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 227 in the Senate Bill 61
 
03:53:43.070 --> 03:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
and here as you'll see there's an
 
03:53:46.309 --> 03:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
appropriation of 150 000 dollars
 
03:53:50.229 --> 03:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
that is made so that an independent um
 
03:53:52.630 --> 03:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
scientists can be
 
03:53:55.030 --> 03:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
consultant can come in
 
03:53:59.210 --> 03:53:59.220 align:start position:0%
I will note that this is something that
 
03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
the state agencies do all the time
 
03:54:03.710 --> 03:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
and it is of course important to make
 
03:54:07.630 --> 03:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
sure that said consultant is unbiased
 
03:54:11.389 --> 03:54:11.399 align:start position:0%
and can do the kind of scientifically
 
03:54:13.790 --> 03:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
based work that is going to inform some
 
03:54:15.950 --> 03:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
of the Judgment there so Madam chair I'm
 
03:54:17.809 --> 03:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
sorry to walk through it I know you can
 
03:54:19.969 --> 03:54:19.979 align:start position:0%
all read and all that but given the
 
03:54:21.590 --> 03:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
importance of this issue for you I just
 
03:54:23.450 --> 03:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
want to make it very clear
 
03:54:25.429 --> 03:54:25.439 align:start position:0%
um how to send it up ended up where it
 
03:54:26.570 --> 03:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
did and I'd be glad to take any
 
03:54:28.610 --> 03:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
questions no I thank you very much for
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
your detailed introduction it's very
 
03:54:33.530 --> 03:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
helpful are there questions from the
 
03:54:33.540 --> 03:54:34.450 align:start position:0%
helpful are there questions from the
committee

03:54:34.450 --> 03:54:34.460 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:54:38.150 --> 03:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative coulon
 
03:54:39.889 --> 03:54:39.899 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you madam chair and
 
03:54:41.210 --> 03:54:41.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my questions
 
03:54:44.450 --> 03:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters I notice in comparing
 
03:54:46.490 --> 03:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
this bill with some of the other bills
 
03:54:48.250 --> 03:54:48.260 align:start position:0%
that have passed through this committee
 
03:54:52.610 --> 03:54:52.620 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't lay out uh specific
 
03:54:55.130 --> 03:54:55.140 align:start position:0%
kind of numbers do you think this will
 
03:54:57.969 --> 03:54:57.979 align:start position:0%
help combat uh legislative
 
03:54:57.979 --> 03:54:59.530 align:start position:0%
help combat uh legislative
incrementalism

03:54:59.530 --> 03:54:59.540 align:start position:0%
incrementalism
 
03:55:03.110 --> 03:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh in the future
 
03:55:05.030 --> 03:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
well thanks for your question I I think
 
03:55:06.590 --> 03:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
that the heart of your question is the
 
03:55:08.689 --> 03:55:08.699 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process which is the
 
03:55:10.429 --> 03:55:10.439 align:start position:0%
legislative process and you know I've
 
03:55:11.750 --> 03:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
been on gel car a number of times
 
03:55:14.330 --> 03:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
probably some of you have as as well and
 
03:55:17.510 --> 03:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
um so that to me is where that issue
 
03:55:20.870 --> 03:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
gets addressed that it's the rulemaking
 
03:55:23.269 --> 03:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
um then and this the spirit of the
 
03:55:25.250 --> 03:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
Senate bill is looking at what has been
 
03:55:26.510 --> 03:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
done in other states that is the
 
03:55:27.889 --> 03:55:27.899 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process which is the
 
03:55:30.050 --> 03:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
legislative process where those those
 
03:55:31.969 --> 03:55:31.979 align:start position:0%
really specific things will be addressed
 
03:55:34.849 --> 03:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
but do note on the bill I think it's
 
03:55:36.710 --> 03:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
pretty clear what the guard rails are
 
03:55:38.870 --> 03:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
and what the criteria are and that's why
 
03:55:40.070 --> 03:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
I wanted to go through them because
 
03:55:41.870 --> 03:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
they're kind of like what what was in
 
03:55:44.510 --> 03:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
454 and 56 actually
 
03:55:46.550 --> 03:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
um you know to say that these are these
 
03:55:47.929 --> 03:55:47.939 align:start position:0%
are the these are the things on which
 
03:55:49.969 --> 03:55:49.979 align:start position:0%
the rules will be made and that's where
 
03:55:52.130 --> 03:55:52.140 align:start position:0%
the real specifics will come in does
 
03:55:53.990 --> 03:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
that answer your question kind of or uh
 
03:55:56.229 --> 03:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
yeah good enough all right thank you
 
03:55:58.550 --> 03:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative germana
 
03:56:00.229 --> 03:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
03:56:02.389 --> 03:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so as we
 
03:56:05.929 --> 03:56:05.939 align:start position:0%
discussed in detail when we uh heard HB
 
03:56:09.469 --> 03:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
56 right we're talking about a a 30 year
 
03:56:11.090 --> 03:56:11.100 align:start position:0%
old kind of process at this point
 
03:56:12.650 --> 03:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
looking at the rules that are currently
 
03:56:14.570 --> 03:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
in place so and we're looking at 24
 
03:56:17.269 --> 03:56:17.279 align:start position:0%
months uh in order to conduct this
 
03:56:19.670 --> 03:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
process of looking into new rules
 
03:56:21.229 --> 03:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
you may not be the best person to ask
 
03:56:23.090 --> 03:56:23.100 align:start position:0%
this question but I'll ask it anyway
 
03:56:25.610 --> 03:56:25.620 align:start position:0%
um do you have a sense of what it is
 
03:56:27.889 --> 03:56:27.899 align:start position:0%
more that we need to be looking for I
 
03:56:29.630 --> 03:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
mean what are the outstanding scientific
 
03:56:32.929 --> 03:56:32.939 align:start position:0%
issues that the past 30 years have not
 
03:56:35.570 --> 03:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
educated us on and what's an extra two
 
03:56:38.210 --> 03:56:38.220 align:start position:0%
years going to do in terms of providing
 
03:56:39.769 --> 03:56:39.779 align:start position:0%
great Revelations about what this
 
03:56:42.110 --> 03:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
process is supposed to be well thanks
 
03:56:44.269 --> 03:56:44.279 align:start position:0%
and I I know the department will talk
 
03:56:45.950 --> 03:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
about that but here's here's my take on
 
03:56:49.550 --> 03:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
it we did anybody even heard of pfas 30
 
03:56:51.530 --> 03:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
years ago anybody even heard of
 
03:56:53.809 --> 03:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
cumulative effects 30 years ago
 
03:56:55.370 --> 03:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
um did we have the kind of Technologies
 
03:56:58.189 --> 03:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
we have now for double and triple lining
 
03:57:00.590 --> 03:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
and Wells to be drilled and trying to
 
03:57:00.600 --> 03:57:01.790 align:start position:0%
and Wells to be drilled and trying to
determine

03:57:01.790 --> 03:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
determine
 
03:57:04.790 --> 03:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
um permeability and and so on a lot has
 
03:57:07.250 --> 03:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
changed both in in our our sense of the
 
03:57:08.809 --> 03:57:08.819 align:start position:0%
necessity of having rules that are
 
03:57:08.819 --> 03:57:09.769 align:start position:0%
necessity of having rules that are
adequate

03:57:09.769 --> 03:57:09.779 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
03:57:12.229 --> 03:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
to deal with the actual materials that
 
03:57:15.830 --> 03:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
are there uh and um you know that and
 
03:57:17.689 --> 03:57:17.699 align:start position:0%
provide the kind of kind of protections
 
03:57:20.150 --> 03:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
that we we need so I think that um
 
03:57:23.389 --> 03:57:23.399 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to be said and and I again
 
03:57:25.309 --> 03:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
will look to the example of the
 
03:57:27.650 --> 03:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
rulemaking that was around the 10-year
 
03:57:27.660 --> 03:57:28.610 align:start position:0%
rulemaking that was around the 10-year
plan

03:57:28.610 --> 03:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
plan
 
03:57:31.010 --> 03:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
the bill was not all that complicated
 
03:57:33.830 --> 03:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
but it said make the rules on various
 
03:57:36.290 --> 03:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
things and the rules are extensive now
 
03:57:38.630 --> 03:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
the rule process if they come into gel
 
03:57:40.969 --> 03:57:40.979 align:start position:0%
car and folks say think that you really
 
03:57:42.050 --> 03:57:42.060 align:start position:0%
didn't get her you didn't cover
 
03:57:43.130 --> 03:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
everything that that's another
 
03:57:45.889 --> 03:57:45.899 align:start position:0%
legislative opportunity to make sure we
 
03:57:46.990 --> 03:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
get it right
 
03:57:49.610 --> 03:57:49.620 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up I appreciate that
 
03:57:51.710 --> 03:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
thank you and I guess my question then
 
03:57:54.349 --> 03:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
is given all of those technological
 
03:57:55.969 --> 03:57:55.979 align:start position:0%
advancements what we know now that we
 
03:57:59.030 --> 03:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
didn't know then do you have a sense of
 
03:58:01.309 --> 03:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
why it is that our rules have not kept
 
03:58:03.469 --> 03:58:03.479 align:start position:0%
pace with you know why are we at this
 
03:58:04.969 --> 03:58:04.979 align:start position:0%
point because it seems to me that all of
 
03:58:06.349 --> 03:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
those developments are new but they're
 
03:58:08.809 --> 03:58:08.819 align:start position:0%
not brand new so why have they not
 
03:58:10.969 --> 03:58:10.979 align:start position:0%
already been Incorporated and what is 24
 
03:58:12.889 --> 03:58:12.899 align:start position:0%
months going to do that the past say 10
 
03:58:15.110 --> 03:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
years hasn't
 
03:58:17.990 --> 03:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
well thanks for the question and um
 
03:58:20.210 --> 03:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
you know I think Solid Waste really
 
03:58:24.050 --> 03:58:24.060 align:start position:0%
emerged over the last 10 12 years as a
 
03:58:26.269 --> 03:58:26.279 align:start position:0%
much more significant issue for all all
 
03:58:27.950 --> 03:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
the New England states that own across
 
03:58:30.590 --> 03:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
the country and I think we became to
 
03:58:33.830 --> 03:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
recognize that business as usual both in
 
03:58:37.429 --> 03:58:37.439 align:start position:0%
um trying to have waste reduction and
 
03:58:39.769 --> 03:58:39.779 align:start position:0%
then also dealing with the new and
 
03:58:43.130 --> 03:58:43.140 align:start position:0%
dangerous potentials chemical leaks I
 
03:58:44.809 --> 03:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
mean who knew you know 30 40 years about
 
03:58:46.849 --> 03:58:46.859 align:start position:0%
about Coakley who knew
 
03:58:48.769 --> 03:58:48.779 align:start position:0%
right now we know
 
03:58:53.090 --> 03:58:53.100 align:start position:0%
so I I think I have real confidence that
 
03:58:55.130 --> 03:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
um we will be informed and we will
 
03:58:57.410 --> 03:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
create good rules and why I mean I've
 
03:58:58.969 --> 03:58:58.979 align:start position:0%
been around for 14 years so I guess I
 
03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
got to blame myself a little bit but uh
 
03:59:02.750 --> 03:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
you know um I'm glad now we're going to
 
03:59:04.729 --> 03:59:04.739 align:start position:0%
address it thank you Senator thank you
 
03:59:07.969 --> 03:59:07.979 align:start position:0%
madam chair yeah representative Bixby
 
03:59:11.870 --> 03:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
so um one aspect of department rules is
 
03:59:15.950 --> 03:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
that they uh get retired on a particular
 
03:59:20.570 --> 03:59:20.580 align:start position:0%
schedule and uh is it correct that the
 
03:59:23.630 --> 03:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
um the sighting rules for landfills are
 
03:59:31.130 --> 03:59:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:32.929 --> 03:59:32.939 align:start position:0%
um I'm you know we had some legislation
 
03:59:34.429 --> 03:59:34.439 align:start position:0%
about this last year I don't remember
 
03:59:36.590 --> 03:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
but I asked the department on that okay
 
03:59:39.229 --> 03:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
thanks and I I will say my own
 
03:59:42.410 --> 03:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
legislative take on it is that if rules
 
03:59:44.809 --> 03:59:44.819 align:start position:0%
expire that they they can ask for them
 
03:59:47.389 --> 03:59:47.399 align:start position:0%
to be a continuance in jail car which I
 
03:59:49.490 --> 03:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
think would be appropriate under here
 
03:59:51.290 --> 03:59:51.300 align:start position:0%
and the safety in this bill is that
 
03:59:53.630 --> 03:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
let's say those rules are continued we
 
03:59:55.070 --> 03:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
have said that anything comes in under
 
03:59:57.170 --> 03:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
those rules we have to be reevaluated
 
03:59:59.689 --> 03:59:59.699 align:start position:0%
when these rules are done
 
04:00:01.429 --> 04:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:00:04.189 --> 04:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
so um one of the things that I'm
 
04:00:06.530 --> 04:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
concerned about is
 
04:00:10.550 --> 04:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
um is that the the 24 months and uh I
 
04:00:15.769 --> 04:00:15.779 align:start position:0%
have seen uh Des effectively uh complete
 
04:00:18.170 --> 04:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
rules uh within on a fairly tight
 
04:00:20.030 --> 04:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
schedule I have also seen them Miss
 
04:00:23.990 --> 04:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
Rules by about six years uh and need to
 
04:00:29.450 --> 04:00:29.460 align:start position:0%
be Pro further prodded um and uh so I uh
 
04:00:29.460 --> 04:00:30.830 align:start position:0%
be Pro further prodded um and uh so I uh
I

04:00:30.830 --> 04:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:00:34.370 --> 04:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
I am really worried about the idea that
 
04:00:37.550 --> 04:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
if we these rules are not completed uh
 
04:00:41.570 --> 04:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
within 24 months that on the
 
04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
that the the rules then automatically go
 
04:00:47.750 --> 04:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
back to what we have now which uh we
 
04:00:51.410 --> 04:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
know there are some problems with uh so
 
04:00:51.420 --> 04:00:52.429 align:start position:0%
know there are some problems with uh so
um

04:00:52.429 --> 04:00:52.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:55.729 --> 04:00:55.739 align:start position:0%
would you see a uh
 
04:00:59.990 --> 04:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
um what would your take be on uh
 
04:01:04.070 --> 04:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
amending the bill so that uh the uh
 
04:01:07.309 --> 04:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
there's still a 24 month deadline but
 
04:01:09.290 --> 04:01:09.300 align:start position:0%
the result of missing that deadline is
 
04:01:12.410 --> 04:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
not going back to the old rules
 
04:01:15.530 --> 04:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
well thanks for your question and um you
 
04:01:18.229 --> 04:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
know in general Madam chair uh we
 
04:01:19.849 --> 04:01:19.859 align:start position:0%
understand the Senate doesn't always get
 
04:01:22.610 --> 04:01:22.620 align:start position:0%
it perfect or even right and if there
 
04:01:25.849 --> 04:01:25.859 align:start position:0%
are some things that could still Garner
 
04:01:27.830 --> 04:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
the support of the Senate and the and
 
04:01:29.929 --> 04:01:29.939 align:start position:0%
the governor and others that uh that
 
04:01:33.889 --> 04:01:33.899 align:start position:0%
make some sense I will note in that you
 
04:01:35.570 --> 04:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
know we talked a lot about the 24 and
 
04:01:37.610 --> 04:01:37.620 align:start position:0%
what time would be needed and one thing
 
04:01:39.650 --> 04:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
that I felt at that time and discussed
 
04:01:40.969 --> 04:01:40.979 align:start position:0%
in our executive session a little bit
 
04:01:43.729 --> 04:01:43.739 align:start position:0%
was that you know this gives us
 
04:01:46.250 --> 04:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
another legislative session
 
04:01:48.710 --> 04:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
that if we see the rules or not
 
04:01:51.290 --> 04:01:51.300 align:start position:0%
happening or there's some uncertainty
 
04:01:54.469 --> 04:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
about it we can put the you know we can
 
04:01:57.110 --> 04:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
raise the hammer and put it down pretty
 
04:02:01.010 --> 04:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
hard uh next next session so I I I I I
 
04:02:03.170 --> 04:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
hear you I mean I was really worried
 
04:02:05.929 --> 04:02:05.939 align:start position:0%
about the tenure Solid Waste planning
 
04:02:07.370 --> 04:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
whether those rules get done and by God
 
04:02:09.710 --> 04:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
they did it but you know it's it's as
 
04:02:11.450 --> 04:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
important for us to keep on it as a
 
04:02:13.910 --> 04:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
legislature and we ultimately have the
 
04:02:17.389 --> 04:02:17.399 align:start position:0%
power um to pass another bill
 
04:02:18.790 --> 04:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's a good point
 
04:02:21.110 --> 04:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins
 
04:02:24.170 --> 04:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and um thank you
 
04:02:26.630 --> 04:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
senator for the work that went into this
 
04:02:26.640 --> 04:02:27.590 align:start position:0%
senator for the work that went into this
bill

04:02:27.590 --> 04:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:02:30.290 --> 04:02:30.300 align:start position:0%
I confess that I'm disappointed that 56
 
04:02:32.750 --> 04:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
didn't make it it was a good bill and
 
04:02:35.689 --> 04:02:35.699 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that we can make 61 even
 
04:02:35.699 --> 04:02:36.710 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that we can make 61 even
better

04:02:36.710 --> 04:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:02:40.490 --> 04:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about the reversion to the
 
04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
old rule just as
 
04:02:46.910 --> 04:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby said I think we
 
04:02:48.769 --> 04:02:48.779 align:start position:0%
need to tighten that language so that
 
04:02:51.170 --> 04:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
it's really clear that we can't go back
 
04:02:55.130 --> 04:02:55.140 align:start position:0%
to that the 30 year old rule isn't good
 
04:02:57.830 --> 04:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
enough for what we now know and we can
 
04:03:00.410 --> 04:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
do better so I think you know we can
 
04:03:02.269 --> 04:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
look forward to amending the language
 
04:03:05.150 --> 04:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
that way I'm concerned about protection
 
04:03:08.050 --> 04:03:08.060 align:start position:0%
I think this is the most important bill
 
04:03:12.229 --> 04:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
that I have been asked to weigh in on in
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
my first term in the legislature I have
 
04:03:17.450 --> 04:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
some experience
 
04:03:17.460 --> 04:03:18.050 align:start position:0%
some experience
um

04:03:18.050 --> 04:03:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:20.950 --> 04:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with industry on the Seacoast
 
04:03:26.150 --> 04:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
and I know that we need Independence we
 
04:03:29.630 --> 04:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
need our government to be responsible to
 
04:03:32.150 --> 04:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
its citizens so I'm going to be looking
 
04:03:34.370 --> 04:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
for ways that we can
 
04:03:37.490 --> 04:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
increase what might look like adequate
 
04:03:40.790 --> 04:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
protection to ample or better protection
 
04:03:43.969 --> 04:03:43.979 align:start position:0%
the best that we can make it
 
04:03:43.979 --> 04:03:44.570 align:start position:0%
the best that we can make it
um

04:03:44.570 --> 04:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:47.269 --> 04:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
so when you said you hope it never
 
04:03:50.510 --> 04:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
happens I think we have to ensure that
 
04:03:53.090 --> 04:03:53.100 align:start position:0%
if it does we have a contingency in
 
04:03:55.490 --> 04:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
place but I do thank you for the work
 
04:03:57.830 --> 04:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
that went into it well thank you for
 
04:03:59.990 --> 04:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
your comments and um you know I think
 
04:04:01.610 --> 04:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
that implicit there are some questions
 
04:04:03.170 --> 04:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
you're going to be asking the folks from
 
04:04:05.809 --> 04:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
Des yes
 
04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for
 
04:04:11.210 --> 04:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters representative Dotsy
 
04:04:13.010 --> 04:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:04:14.570 --> 04:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:04:17.929 --> 04:04:17.939 align:start position:0%
I have to say when I read this bill I I
 
04:04:21.290 --> 04:04:21.300 align:start position:0%
found it to be a head scratcher okay
 
04:04:24.650 --> 04:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
um a probably 30 to 40 years ago there
 
04:04:27.290 --> 04:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
was a company called WR Grace in Woburn
 
04:04:27.300 --> 04:04:29.090 align:start position:0%
was a company called WR Grace in Woburn
Massachusetts

04:04:29.090 --> 04:04:29.100 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
04:04:32.570 --> 04:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
um that had uh polluted the water the
 
04:04:35.630 --> 04:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
groundwater in Woburn uh seriously there
 
04:04:38.809 --> 04:04:38.819 align:start position:0%
were a lot of cancer clusters there and
 
04:04:42.429 --> 04:04:42.439 align:start position:0%
a huge amount of geological uh
 
04:04:46.250 --> 04:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
geohydrology was done to understand the
 
04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
groundwater and how those toxins were
 
04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
dispersed in in that area so we already
 
04:04:55.130 --> 04:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
I mean and I don't think that water
 
04:04:58.849 --> 04:04:58.859 align:start position:0%
movement changes that much over 40 years
 
04:05:01.490 --> 04:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
okay I mean maybe the way we detect it
 
04:05:03.469 --> 04:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
and maybe we're a little bit more
 
04:05:05.870 --> 04:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
sophisticated but water moves where
 
04:05:08.269 --> 04:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
water wants to move and that's happened
 
04:05:13.189 --> 04:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
we already had a bill 56 that looked at
 
04:05:16.010 --> 04:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
the hydrogeology and came up with
 
04:05:16.020 --> 04:05:17.469 align:start position:0%
the hydrogeology and came up with
recommendations

04:05:17.469 --> 04:05:17.479 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
04:05:20.450 --> 04:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
and we could get working on it right
 
04:05:24.889 --> 04:05:24.899 align:start position:0%
away so I'm really questioning why
 
04:05:30.290 --> 04:05:30.300 align:start position:0%
if we have at least 40 Years of data
 
04:05:33.650 --> 04:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
and we know how water moves and we had a
 
04:05:35.929 --> 04:05:35.939 align:start position:0%
bill that addressed this why we're
 
04:05:38.330 --> 04:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
kicking the can down the road two more
 
04:05:38.340 --> 04:05:40.309 align:start position:0%
kicking the can down the road two more
years

04:05:40.309 --> 04:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:05:44.150 --> 04:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:46.969 --> 04:05:46.979 align:start position:0%
I I think that I disagree and this is
 
04:05:49.130 --> 04:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
why I put Senate Bill 227 in which got
 
04:05:51.889 --> 04:05:51.899 align:start position:0%
Incorporated here in the statement that
 
04:05:53.630 --> 04:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
we know how water moves yeah I mean we
 
04:05:56.389 --> 04:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
know how water moves it seeks the lowest
 
04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
level but we do not know in particular
 
04:06:00.479 --> 04:06:01.670 align:start position:0%
level but we do not know in particular
sites

04:06:01.670 --> 04:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
sites
 
04:06:03.410 --> 04:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
particularly one in the North Country
 
04:06:06.170 --> 04:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
which is much the subject of a lot of
 
04:06:08.269 --> 04:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
concerns exactly what the groundwater
 
04:06:11.030 --> 04:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
does when you get deep down under there
 
04:06:14.450 --> 04:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's where when the
 
04:06:16.670 --> 04:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
idea is site-specific is we want to make
 
04:06:20.450 --> 04:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
sure we know how the water is Flowing at
 
04:06:22.429 --> 04:06:22.439 align:start position:0%
that site and I was not convinced that
 
04:06:24.769 --> 04:06:24.779 align:start position:0%
we really did and that we needed to know
 
04:06:28.969 --> 04:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
so I think this bill is a twofer yes
 
04:06:31.010 --> 04:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
when you're evaluating the application
 
04:06:33.290 --> 04:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
there is a hydrological assessment at
 
04:06:34.429 --> 04:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
that time
 
04:06:39.469 --> 04:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
but this gives a tool to Des
 
04:06:41.510 --> 04:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
and some funding
 
04:06:44.570 --> 04:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
to do studies of hydrogeology and
 
04:06:44.580 --> 04:06:45.590 align:start position:0%
to do studies of hydrogeology and
groundwater

04:06:45.590 --> 04:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
groundwater
 
04:06:48.530 --> 04:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
that can help inform them scientifically
 
04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
so they're prepared for what might be
 
04:06:52.670 --> 04:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
the size specific
 
04:06:55.010 --> 04:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
so that would be my difference here is I
 
04:06:56.990 --> 04:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think we really do know and if
 
04:06:58.309 --> 04:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to have site specific we
 
04:07:00.650 --> 04:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
better really know about that site about
 
04:07:03.050 --> 04:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
where the groundwater might go and how
 
04:07:05.090 --> 04:07:05.100 align:start position:0%
fast it might get there and I was I'm
 
04:07:06.889 --> 04:07:06.899 align:start position:0%
just not convinced we really actually
 
04:07:09.229 --> 04:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
know that
 
04:07:09.239 --> 04:07:11.450 align:start position:0%
know that
no

04:07:11.450 --> 04:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:07:15.889 --> 04:07:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:19.010 --> 04:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
um oh go ahead yeah no for me I um I
 
04:07:21.769 --> 04:07:21.779 align:start position:0%
think this is a really good
 
04:07:24.950 --> 04:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
a really good bill and um
 
04:07:27.290 --> 04:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
I thank you and and your committee for
 
04:07:29.450 --> 04:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
for working on it and putting the time
 
04:07:33.590 --> 04:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
and effort and thought into it as well
 
04:07:36.229 --> 04:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and obviously
 
04:07:38.090 --> 04:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
Senator Evart will be back and I'm
 
04:07:40.610 --> 04:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
around for any questions but uh you'll
 
04:07:42.650 --> 04:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
get the real facts are probably people
 
04:07:46.250 --> 04:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
behind us thank you thank you very much
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry one question from uh
 
04:07:52.370 --> 04:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza so I just have a
 
04:07:54.290 --> 04:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
question about
 
04:07:56.030 --> 04:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
um you're saying that these rules in
 
04:07:58.389 --> 04:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
section three and four will be
 
04:08:01.790 --> 04:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
interpreted by JL Carr when would that
 
04:08:04.070 --> 04:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
happen so let's just say that this
 
04:08:07.490 --> 04:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
passes what's what's that process I know
 
04:08:09.889 --> 04:08:09.899 align:start position:0%
we have a deadline saying when they have
 
04:08:12.950 --> 04:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
to have it done by which
 
04:08:15.349 --> 04:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
so what does this look like
 
04:08:17.510 --> 04:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
um that's a question and um you know Des
 
04:08:19.250 --> 04:08:19.260 align:start position:0%
will be able to tell you in terms of
 
04:08:21.650 --> 04:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
this specific rulemaking what a timeline
 
04:08:23.269 --> 04:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
will look like but in general what
 
04:08:25.250 --> 04:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
happens is the department
 
04:08:27.950 --> 04:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
either has rule renewal or a bill like
 
04:08:30.290 --> 04:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
this asks them to make rules under 541a
 
04:08:33.469 --> 04:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
and then they they they work on the
 
04:08:35.450 --> 04:08:35.460 align:start position:0%
rules they do the scientific work and
 
04:08:37.370 --> 04:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
all the staff work they have to do and
 
04:08:39.590 --> 04:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
Consultants maybe sometimes and they
 
04:08:43.010 --> 04:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
bring that then to get on the um agenda
 
04:08:45.170 --> 04:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
for gel car and then the gel car process
 
04:08:47.570 --> 04:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
is that the gel car attorneys work on
 
04:08:49.610 --> 04:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
the rules to make sure they comply um
 
04:08:51.410 --> 04:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
legally with requirements and rules and
 
04:08:53.210 --> 04:08:53.220 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth and then they are
 
04:08:55.070 --> 04:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
brought to gel car and gel car has
 
04:08:57.530 --> 04:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
public hearing and then it can decide to
 
04:09:00.170 --> 04:09:00.180 align:start position:0%
accept uh ask for revision or reject
 
04:09:02.389 --> 04:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
rules and then the department can bring
 
04:09:04.130 --> 04:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
them back in
 
04:09:06.469 --> 04:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
um but that that process is kind of laid
 
04:09:08.510 --> 04:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
out under under gel cards very thorough
 
04:09:11.570 --> 04:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
yep follow-up yeah I'm familiar with the
 
04:09:14.510 --> 04:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
gel call process I just feel as if
 
04:09:14.520 --> 04:09:15.229 align:start position:0%
gel call process I just feel as if
um

04:09:15.229 --> 04:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:17.150 --> 04:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
all of the work that's been done on this
 
04:09:19.189 --> 04:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
which I'm new on this committee so
 
04:09:20.510 --> 04:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of work and the
 
04:09:21.889 --> 04:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
subject has been you know there's a lot
 
04:09:23.210 --> 04:09:23.220 align:start position:0%
of Representatives that are here that
 
04:09:25.729 --> 04:09:25.739 align:start position:0%
have done a lot of work on this so and
 
04:09:26.929 --> 04:09:26.939 align:start position:0%
that have been waiting for this for a
 
04:09:28.250 --> 04:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
long time
 
04:09:30.650 --> 04:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
it's just jail cars operating within its
 
04:09:33.229 --> 04:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
own so where what experts are they using
 
04:09:34.729 --> 04:09:34.739 align:start position:0%
you're saying that outside people are
 
04:09:36.710 --> 04:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
coming in to do all of that to setting
 
04:09:38.510 --> 04:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
these rules so because they're not
 
04:09:39.889 --> 04:09:39.899 align:start position:0%
arbitrary but it's really not coming
 
04:09:41.330 --> 04:09:41.340 align:start position:0%
back to the committee that's really been
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
working on this in the house they're
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:47.689 --> 04:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
well thanks for the question and you
 
04:09:50.689 --> 04:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
know um gel Carr is a legislative it's a
 
04:09:52.070 --> 04:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
legislative committee
 
04:09:54.110 --> 04:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if any members on this
 
04:09:55.490 --> 04:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
committee are on it but it's a large
 
04:09:57.710 --> 04:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
legislative Committee of house and and
 
04:10:01.250 --> 04:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
uh and Senate um members and five and
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
five yep yeah and uh and so
 
04:10:08.450 --> 04:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
it is it is a legislative committee and
 
04:10:10.429 --> 04:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
um you can ask particularly about what
 
04:10:13.550 --> 04:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
the expectations are from Des about the
 
04:10:15.050 --> 04:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
process the rule making we're looking at
 
04:10:16.610 --> 04:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
the Des what they're going to do to do
 
04:10:19.010 --> 04:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking here but that's why we
 
04:10:21.170 --> 04:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
did the two years because originally
 
04:10:22.790 --> 04:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
we're thinking of a tighter timeline and
 
04:10:25.670 --> 04:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
we were told by Des we can't do this
 
04:10:28.550 --> 04:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
right unless we have the and but we are
 
04:10:31.070 --> 04:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
confident in two years so that's that's
 
04:10:33.950 --> 04:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
why that that timeline is in here but do
 
04:10:36.590 --> 04:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
ask them about their their what they
 
04:10:38.030 --> 04:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
imagine the process here of this
 
04:10:40.429 --> 04:10:40.439 align:start position:0%
rulemaking will be okay I will thank you
 
04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby just a
 
04:10:44.870 --> 04:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
little clarification in terms of gel car
 
04:10:47.809 --> 04:10:47.819 align:start position:0%
uh there are two ways that
 
04:10:50.210 --> 04:10:50.220 align:start position:0%
um this committee could potentially have
 
04:10:53.870 --> 04:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
input one is that uh a member of gel
 
04:10:56.510 --> 04:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
Carr might see this might see rules
 
04:10:59.150 --> 04:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
coming up related to this bill and
 
04:11:01.670 --> 04:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
consult with us because they know that
 
04:11:04.189 --> 04:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
we went through the process with this
 
04:11:08.150 --> 04:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
bill uh and uh the other is that the
 
04:11:11.689 --> 04:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
speaker's office is now publishing on a
 
04:11:14.990 --> 04:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
bi-weekly basis the bills that are the
 
04:11:17.090 --> 04:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
rules that are coming up before gel car
 
04:11:19.370 --> 04:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
so we'll we will be alerted to when
 
04:11:21.769 --> 04:11:21.779 align:start position:0%
these rules are going to be considered
 
04:11:23.990 --> 04:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
and we can approach members of gel car
 
04:11:28.610 --> 04:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:30.650 --> 04:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:11:34.849 --> 04:11:34.859 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Senator Waters
 
04:11:37.130 --> 04:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
the next person I'd like to call up
 
04:11:48.110 --> 04:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:48.120 --> 04:11:51.469 align:start position:0%
 
cription

04:11:51.469 --> 04:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:51.479 --> 04:11:55.070 align:start position:0%
 
understand

04:11:55.070 --> 04:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:59.150 --> 04:11:59.160 align:start position:0%

good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
04:12:08.809 --> 04:12:08.819 align:start position:0%
the committee um for the record my name
 
04:12:10.729 --> 04:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
is Mike Wimsatt a service director of
 
04:12:11.689 --> 04:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of

Environmental Services Waste Management
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
Division and I forget I forgive me I did
 
04:12:17.510 --> 04:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
not put it on the card but joining me
 
04:12:19.250 --> 04:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
today is our assistant commissioner Mark
 
04:12:19.260 --> 04:12:20.809 align:start position:0%
today is our assistant commissioner Mark
Sanborn

04:12:20.809 --> 04:12:20.819 align:start position:0%
Sanborn
 
04:12:22.849 --> 04:12:22.859 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the opportunity to come
 
04:12:26.090 --> 04:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
and testify on Senate bill 61.
 
04:12:28.130 --> 04:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
um the department does support this bill
 
04:12:31.189 --> 04:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh we the the bill would amend and I I
 
04:12:33.830 --> 04:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's hard to improve on Senator Waters
 
04:12:35.689 --> 04:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
very thorough uh introduction in the
 
04:12:38.389 --> 04:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
bill but you know as stated it amends
 
04:12:42.050 --> 04:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
our say 149 M to direct the agency to
 
04:12:44.210 --> 04:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
adopt rules that establish criteria for
 
04:12:46.610 --> 04:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
setting site-specific setback surface
 
04:12:49.070 --> 04:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
water setbacks for landfills and of
 
04:12:51.290 --> 04:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
course it also directs us to contract
 
04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
for an outside party a call qualified
 
04:12:56.630 --> 04:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
contractor to assess our current rules
 
04:12:59.269 --> 04:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
and make any recommendations for uh
 
04:13:01.510 --> 04:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
changes or improvements to those rules
 
04:13:04.130 --> 04:13:04.140 align:start position:0%
as this committee knows perhaps better
 
04:13:06.110 --> 04:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
than anyone this issue has been a topic
 
04:13:07.910 --> 04:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
of great interest for the general court
 
04:13:09.590 --> 04:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
and for the public for a number of years
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
now and we believe that this bill is
 
04:13:13.969 --> 04:13:13.979 align:start position:0%
going to be an effective way of
 
04:13:17.450 --> 04:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
addressing the topic and we support it
 
04:13:19.729 --> 04:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
um essentially as Senator Waters
 
04:13:19.739 --> 04:13:20.950 align:start position:0%
um essentially as Senator Waters
indicated

04:13:20.950 --> 04:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
we're to consider in our rule making
 
04:13:26.570 --> 04:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
um hydrogen hydrogeologic
 
04:13:28.490 --> 04:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
characteristics and conditions that is
 
04:13:31.490 --> 04:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
specific to a site and and describe how
 
04:13:33.349 --> 04:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
those will be used to determine what an
 
04:13:35.510 --> 04:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate site-specific setback might
 
04:13:38.389 --> 04:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
be for a landfill we're also to consider
 
04:13:41.269 --> 04:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
certain uh Beyond compliance if you will
 
04:13:43.130 --> 04:13:43.140 align:start position:0%
or additional technologies that could be
 
04:13:44.990 --> 04:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
applied at a given site that might
 
04:13:47.210 --> 04:13:47.220 align:start position:0%
influence what would be considered a
 
04:13:50.510 --> 04:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
safe setback distance for that site but
 
04:13:52.729 --> 04:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
importantly this this this report that
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
we're to contract for uh will really
 
04:13:57.410 --> 04:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
bring in a third-party contractor to
 
04:13:59.150 --> 04:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
really take an eyes open look at our
 
04:14:01.309 --> 04:14:01.319 align:start position:0%
current regulations you know probably
 
04:14:02.870 --> 04:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
look at you know we would anticipate
 
04:14:04.610 --> 04:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
them also reviewing neighboring states
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
regulations and basically review that
 
04:14:09.769 --> 04:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
and make recommendations for where they
 
04:14:12.110 --> 04:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
might see those our current rules
 
04:14:13.729 --> 04:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
lacking and how they might be improved
 
04:14:16.429 --> 04:14:16.439 align:start position:0%
upon so what we anticipate has been to
 
04:14:18.650 --> 04:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
discussed is that this 24-month period
 
04:14:20.689 --> 04:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
from passage of the bill it's a Target
 
04:14:23.150 --> 04:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
date for for this rulemaking we have
 
04:14:26.030 --> 04:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
every and anticipation and expectation
 
04:14:27.889 --> 04:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
that we will meet that that Target
 
04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
deadline and uh we would what we would
 
04:14:33.290 --> 04:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
do is we'd immediately work to get if
 
04:14:35.750 --> 04:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
the bill were to pass immediately get a
 
04:14:37.910 --> 04:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
Contracting process going get a
 
04:14:39.710 --> 04:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
Contractor on board with an expectation
 
04:14:41.450 --> 04:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
that the report from that contractor
 
04:14:45.050 --> 04:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
would come in the fall of 24 and that
 
04:14:47.150 --> 04:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
that would help to inform our rulemaking
 
04:14:49.610 --> 04:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
process which we would uh you know then
 
04:14:52.610 --> 04:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
early in 25 we would anticipate filing
 
04:14:54.889 --> 04:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
an initial proposal for rulemaking which
 
04:14:57.410 --> 04:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
would put us on a trajectory to have a
 
04:14:59.630 --> 04:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
rules finalized by the summer of 25
 
04:15:03.050 --> 04:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
which would be that 24-month period so
 
04:15:05.330 --> 04:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
with that I'll turn it over to our
 
04:15:07.429 --> 04:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner
 
04:15:09.170 --> 04:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
thanks Mike
 
04:15:11.090 --> 04:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
um afternoon everyone appreciate the
 
04:15:11.100 --> 04:15:12.229 align:start position:0%
um afternoon everyone appreciate the
opportunity

04:15:12.229 --> 04:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
04:15:14.990 --> 04:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
um I've been asked to clarify the
 
04:15:16.429 --> 04:15:16.439 align:start position:0%
Department's position on a couple
 
04:15:19.189 --> 04:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
amendments Etc so I'll just quickly do
 
04:15:21.590 --> 04:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
that uh the director already mentioned
 
04:15:21.600 --> 04:15:22.790 align:start position:0%
that uh the director already mentioned
one

04:15:22.790 --> 04:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:15:26.450 --> 04:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
um Mr Sanborn we have no amendments
 
04:15:30.189 --> 04:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
at this time I may clarify a few points
 
04:15:33.849 --> 04:15:33.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:35.710 --> 04:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
some positions of the department
 
04:15:39.650 --> 04:15:39.660 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill okay but we we have
 
04:15:41.510 --> 04:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
no amendments on that yes committee has
 
04:15:43.010 --> 04:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
no amendments on this bill at this time
 
04:15:46.370 --> 04:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
I understood Madam chair just uh let me
 
04:15:49.670 --> 04:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
just make a few broad uh General points
 
04:15:53.030 --> 04:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
about uh the position of the department
 
04:15:56.030 --> 04:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
um the director already mentioned one we
 
04:15:58.490 --> 04:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
intend the scope to include neighboring
 
04:16:02.090 --> 04:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
states and a review of that
 
04:16:05.150 --> 04:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
um when the study is published uh we
 
04:16:07.969 --> 04:16:07.979 align:start position:0%
were very open to public comments and
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
reactions to those and
 
04:16:13.010 --> 04:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
um uh and plus there will be opportunity
 
04:16:14.809 --> 04:16:14.819 align:start position:0%
during the rule making for any public
 
04:16:14.819 --> 04:16:16.490 align:start position:0%
during the rule making for any public
comments

04:16:16.490 --> 04:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
comments
 
04:16:16.500 --> 04:16:17.170 align:start position:0%
comments
um

04:16:17.170 --> 04:16:17.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:17.180 --> 04:16:18.769 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:16:18.769 --> 04:16:18.779 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:16:18.779 --> 04:16:19.450 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:16:19.450 --> 04:16:19.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:23.689 --> 04:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
the uh oh and we will ensure there's no
 
04:16:25.550 --> 04:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest in their Provisions
 
04:16:27.229 --> 04:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
in the contract to make sure there won't
 
04:16:30.229 --> 04:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
be conflicts of interest down the line
 
04:16:34.729 --> 04:16:34.739 align:start position:0%
um on the issue of of a potential of not
 
04:16:37.670 --> 04:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
having a 24 month time period and that
 
04:16:39.650 --> 04:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
being removed and it being opened ended
 
04:16:41.990 --> 04:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
the department does have concerns with
 
04:16:44.710 --> 04:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
that potential that could artificially
 
04:16:47.570 --> 04:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
prolong the rulemaking process in a way
 
04:16:51.110 --> 04:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
that we don't feel would be beneficial
 
04:16:55.070 --> 04:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
um so we want to build a pass we this
 
04:16:57.110 --> 04:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
has been going on for multiple sessions
 
04:16:58.969 --> 04:16:58.979 align:start position:0%
and we're ready to move on with a rule
 
04:16:58.979 --> 04:17:00.250 align:start position:0%
and we're ready to move on with a rule
making

04:17:00.250 --> 04:17:00.260 align:start position:0%
making
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
SB 61 that's currently amended the
 
04:17:05.450 --> 04:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
version in front of you the department
 
04:17:09.110 --> 04:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
can support and I have every confidence
 
04:17:11.269 --> 04:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
and expectation that it would make it
 
04:17:13.729 --> 04:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
through and be signed into law any
 
04:17:17.030 --> 04:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
changes to it puts that in danger
 
04:17:20.450 --> 04:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
so I just throw that out to you I I we
 
04:17:22.610 --> 04:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
want to see something pass the version
 
04:17:24.769 --> 04:17:24.779 align:start position:0%
in front of you I know can happen
 
04:17:28.429 --> 04:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
any changes to it I fear would derail
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
that and we'd end up with another
 
04:17:35.210 --> 04:17:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:37.849 --> 04:17:37.859 align:start position:0%
um so I have a question for you or for
 
04:17:41.269 --> 04:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
director wimsat with regard to the RFP
 
04:17:45.769 --> 04:17:45.779 align:start position:0%
process and how what What mechanisms do
 
04:17:48.410 --> 04:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
you have in your RFP process maybe you
 
04:17:50.830 --> 04:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
can just describe the process to us
 
04:17:53.870 --> 04:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
which will ensure that there's no
 
04:17:57.050 --> 04:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest in any third party
 
04:18:01.309 --> 04:18:01.319 align:start position:0%
that you would employ to do this study
 
04:18:03.889 --> 04:18:03.899 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna let the director run
 
04:18:05.389 --> 04:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
through what we'll use for RPG just
 
04:18:06.830 --> 04:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
remember to include we're going to take
 
04:18:09.530 --> 04:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
public comments on scope
 
04:18:11.630 --> 04:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question so what
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
we anticipate is that you know we we do
 
04:18:17.150 --> 04:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
do a fair amount of solicitations for
 
04:18:19.490 --> 04:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
contractors uh often on a qualifications
 
04:18:21.530 --> 04:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
based selection process for engineering
 
04:18:23.750 --> 04:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
and hydro geologists
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
um we hire a number of contractors we
 
04:18:27.469 --> 04:18:27.479 align:start position:0%
have them on board at any given time for
 
04:18:29.689 --> 04:18:29.699 align:start position:0%
that kind of work so we would anticipate
 
04:18:31.550 --> 04:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
following a similar process where we put
 
04:18:33.889 --> 04:18:33.899 align:start position:0%
out a request for proposals that would
 
04:18:33.899 --> 04:18:34.910 align:start position:0%
out a request for proposals that would
provide

04:18:34.910 --> 04:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
provide
 
04:18:38.389 --> 04:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
um a responsive uh parties to provide
 
04:18:40.309 --> 04:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
their uh summary of their qualifications
 
04:18:43.070 --> 04:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
in a proposal for completing the work as
 
04:18:45.050 --> 04:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
described in the in the bill or in the
 
04:18:47.630 --> 04:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
law and then based on that we would
 
04:18:50.689 --> 04:18:50.699 align:start position:0%
likely put together a panel of Des staff
 
04:18:53.090 --> 04:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
who would then uh you know to the extent
 
04:18:54.769 --> 04:18:54.779 align:start position:0%
we have a large number of applicants we
 
04:18:57.050 --> 04:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
would narrow down to based on the
 
04:18:58.750 --> 04:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
qualifications packages
 
04:19:01.729 --> 04:19:01.739 align:start position:0%
and proposals a certain number that we
 
04:19:02.870 --> 04:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
would interview and then we would
 
04:19:04.910 --> 04:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
interview them and then make a selection
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
based on that process and then we would
 
04:19:09.469 --> 04:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
anticipate that you know as is always
 
04:19:11.630 --> 04:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
been the case we we deal with when we're
 
04:19:13.790 --> 04:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
hiring contractors we always have to be
 
04:19:15.590 --> 04:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about about conflict of
 
04:19:18.170 --> 04:19:18.180 align:start position:0%
interest when we normally are you know
 
04:19:20.809 --> 04:19:20.819 align:start position:0%
letting a contract it may be for a
 
04:19:22.969 --> 04:19:22.979 align:start position:0%
specific project in which case we would
 
04:19:25.070 --> 04:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
evaluate conflicts specific to that
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
project right at the outset or in many
 
04:19:29.450 --> 04:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
of the contracts we let are broad
 
04:19:31.070 --> 04:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
contracts which we don't necessarily
 
04:19:33.290 --> 04:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
even know what the projects will be so
 
04:19:35.269 --> 04:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
once they're on board we will generally
 
04:19:37.070 --> 04:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
vet those when we're trying to select
 
04:19:38.870 --> 04:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
which contractor will do a particular
 
04:19:41.630 --> 04:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
job we would evaluate conflicts
 
04:19:43.070 --> 04:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
potential conflicts of interest during
 
04:19:45.290 --> 04:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
that process for this one we know what
 
04:19:47.330 --> 04:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
the topic is so we would be able to
 
04:19:49.130 --> 04:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
evaluate that on the front end and we
 
04:19:52.010 --> 04:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
would anticipate that that would be we
 
04:19:53.750 --> 04:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
would expect them to address the
 
04:19:55.910 --> 04:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
question of any potential conflicts in
 
04:19:58.670 --> 04:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
their proposals and then the app the
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
interview process we'd be able to
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
explore that if we have any concerns
 
04:20:03.769 --> 04:20:03.779 align:start position:0%
about it and then we can make a decision
 
04:20:09.710 --> 04:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:11.870 --> 04:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so I would note
 
04:20:14.689 --> 04:20:14.699 align:start position:0%
um that as the bill is constructed right
 
04:20:17.210 --> 04:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
now when we put together a draft request
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
for proposals that draft Tower of P
 
04:20:21.290 --> 04:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
would go out for public comment before
 
04:20:23.510 --> 04:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
we actually issue it so there would be
 
04:20:25.010 --> 04:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for the public to comment
 
04:20:27.290 --> 04:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
on the content of that request and then
 
04:20:28.790 --> 04:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
what would you do with the comment when
 
04:20:30.410 --> 04:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
you receive it oh we would consider
 
04:20:32.990 --> 04:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
those comments and and and and as we do
 
04:20:35.330 --> 04:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
it often with comments we may amend the
 
04:20:37.130 --> 04:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
document to reflect and address those
 
04:20:37.140 --> 04:20:38.389 align:start position:0%
document to reflect and address those
comments

04:20:38.389 --> 04:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
comments
 
04:20:40.729 --> 04:20:40.739 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative
 
04:20:40.739 --> 04:20:41.809 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative
Creighton

04:20:41.809 --> 04:20:41.819 align:start position:0%
Creighton
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
hi yep
 
04:20:45.889 --> 04:20:45.899 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
 
04:20:48.590 --> 04:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you director the um
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
as I look at at uh page five under line
 
04:20:56.210 --> 04:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
seven it has you going back if if a
 
04:20:58.969 --> 04:20:58.979 align:start position:0%
contract is not done in 24 months
 
04:20:58.979 --> 04:21:00.950 align:start position:0%
contract is not done in 24 months
those

04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:21:02.450 --> 04:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
um projects that were held in the Bands
 
04:21:05.330 --> 04:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
then go back to current rules
 
04:21:09.349 --> 04:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
um to me I mean I always like to going
 
04:21:11.210 --> 04:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
into a contract understand it's going to
 
04:21:13.370 --> 04:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
be completed in the time and that if
 
04:21:14.929 --> 04:21:14.939 align:start position:0%
it's not then there's consequences well
 
04:21:14.939 --> 04:21:15.769 align:start position:0%
it's not then there's consequences well
this

04:21:15.769 --> 04:21:15.779 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:21:17.870 --> 04:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
it says there's no consequences if it's
 
04:21:20.330 --> 04:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
not done and and so what's the assurance
 
04:21:23.150 --> 04:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
that this has been done in 24 months
 
04:21:26.630 --> 04:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
well I I read that wrong sure that's a
 
04:21:28.370 --> 04:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
great question what I can assure you is
 
04:21:31.189 --> 04:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
that the importance and the value of
 
04:21:32.510 --> 04:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
this work
 
04:21:34.010 --> 04:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
um on the part of the general court in
 
04:21:35.990 --> 04:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
the public is not at all lost on the
 
04:21:37.790 --> 04:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
agency we will do everything in our
 
04:21:39.590 --> 04:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
power to make sure that we get the
 
04:21:42.170 --> 04:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
contract let promptly and get the report
 
04:21:44.990 --> 04:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
promptly and that we then
 
04:21:47.030 --> 04:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
um Undertake and we will be we will be
 
04:21:49.250 --> 04:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
concurrently working on our rulemaking
 
04:21:52.550 --> 04:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
and basically a a format for that with
 
04:21:54.590 --> 04:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
the idea that it could be that it will
 
04:21:56.450 --> 04:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
be informed by the report once it's
 
04:21:59.210 --> 04:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
available and then we'll make sure that
 
04:22:01.910 --> 04:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
we have a proposal an initial proposal
 
04:22:03.229 --> 04:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
for rulemaking which is the first
 
04:22:05.630 --> 04:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
official step in rulemaking filed early
 
04:22:07.849 --> 04:22:07.859 align:start position:0%
in 25 so that we'll be on a trajectory
 
04:22:10.189 --> 04:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
to have those rules completed by the
 
04:22:13.750 --> 04:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:16.849 --> 04:22:16.859 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and so
 
04:22:16.859 --> 04:22:17.809 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and so
um

04:22:17.809 --> 04:22:17.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:20.269 --> 04:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
under that line seven then is there a
 
04:22:23.750 --> 04:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
reason that it has to be in the bill
 
04:22:28.130 --> 04:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:29.630 --> 04:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
you see what I'm talking about Oh you
 
04:22:31.309 --> 04:22:31.319 align:start position:0%
mean with respect to what happens if the
 
04:22:33.950 --> 04:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
rules are not made right I I think
 
04:22:35.750 --> 04:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's in there because it's a I mean
 
04:22:38.150 --> 04:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
this bill represents uh you know I've
 
04:22:40.550 --> 04:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
described it as basically a boat that
 
04:22:42.290 --> 04:22:42.300 align:start position:0%
everybody could get on it was a build it
 
04:22:44.870 --> 04:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
was intended to have the support of all
 
04:22:46.370 --> 04:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
the parties who have an interest in this
 
04:22:49.070 --> 04:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
and I think that parties who might be
 
04:22:50.450 --> 04:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
interested in filing a permit
 
04:22:52.969 --> 04:22:52.979 align:start position:0%
application don't want a completely
 
04:22:56.090 --> 04:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
open-ended process where by
 
04:22:59.389 --> 04:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
they might never have never have an
 
04:23:01.429 --> 04:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have their permit
 
04:23:03.950 --> 04:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
application reviewed and decided on
 
04:23:06.530 --> 04:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
under the rules so I think it represents
 
04:23:09.050 --> 04:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
a compromise of the parties to get
 
04:23:10.550 --> 04:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
language that everybody could get behind
 
04:23:12.110 --> 04:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
I mean very candidly I think that's what
 
04:23:14.510 --> 04:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
it represents okay thank you
 
04:23:16.849 --> 04:23:16.859 align:start position:0%
I just want to quickly add
 
04:23:19.910 --> 04:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
um a part of the the way this bill is
 
04:23:23.689 --> 04:23:23.699 align:start position:0%
written is there some level of trust and
 
04:23:25.670 --> 04:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
faith that Des is going to be able to do
 
04:23:26.689 --> 04:23:26.699 align:start position:0%
our job
 
04:23:26.699 --> 04:23:28.250 align:start position:0%
our job
and

04:23:28.250 --> 04:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:23:31.790 --> 04:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
believe I believe we we were the ones
 
04:23:35.210 --> 04:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
who uh proposed to the folks involved
 
04:23:37.309 --> 04:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
that we could do this in 24 months if we
 
04:23:39.889 --> 04:23:39.899 align:start position:0%
didn't think we could do it we know this
 
04:23:42.410 --> 04:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
that we know how scrutinized this
 
04:23:45.530 --> 04:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
process will be how much everyone has
 
04:23:47.570 --> 04:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
put into this so
 
04:23:50.630 --> 04:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
um we we are going to do everything to
 
04:23:52.250 --> 04:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
do we're going to move process
 
04:23:55.130 --> 04:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
concurrently where we can we are going
 
04:23:58.309 --> 04:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
to meet the 24 months so
 
04:24:00.349 --> 04:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
um and and that's the only balance to
 
04:24:02.330 --> 04:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
being able to get folks who come from
 
04:24:04.370 --> 04:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
different perspectives on this a
 
04:24:06.650 --> 04:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
timeline is necessary because an
 
04:24:08.990 --> 04:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
open-ended just won't work for the other
 
04:24:09.000 --> 04:24:17.870 align:start position:0%
open-ended just won't work for the other
side

04:24:17.870 --> 04:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:20.090 --> 04:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
both of you for taking my question I did
 
04:24:22.490 --> 04:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
have a question again about RFP in the
 
04:24:26.210 --> 04:24:26.220 align:start position:0%
event that um you get one uh or have
 
04:24:28.670 --> 04:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
trouble even getting posted let's say
 
04:24:30.050 --> 04:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
that that would happen What would the
 
04:24:32.090 --> 04:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
other process be if you don't have a
 
04:24:34.330 --> 04:24:34.340 align:start position:0%
large pool of applicants
 
04:24:36.889 --> 04:24:36.899 align:start position:0%
well we certainly we think that there
 
04:24:38.929 --> 04:24:38.939 align:start position:0%
are there there is a a relatively large
 
04:24:40.550 --> 04:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
pool of applicants in the region who
 
04:24:42.110 --> 04:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
would be qualified to do this kind of
 
04:24:44.510 --> 04:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
work so we don't anticipate having a a
 
04:24:46.610 --> 04:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
terribly small
 
04:24:49.370 --> 04:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
a pool of applicants but our
 
04:24:51.189 --> 04:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
expectations as long as we have
 
04:24:53.269 --> 04:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
responsive applicants whatever number
 
04:24:55.250 --> 04:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
that is that we believe are qualified we
 
04:24:58.070 --> 04:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
will interview and make a selection
 
04:25:00.110 --> 04:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins
 
04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to clarify something I
 
04:25:08.389 --> 04:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
was confused by Mr sanborn's comments
 
04:25:08.399 --> 04:25:10.010 align:start position:0%
was confused by Mr sanborn's comments
that

04:25:10.010 --> 04:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:25:12.889 --> 04:25:12.899 align:start position:0%
um a certain Amendment or alteration
 
04:25:16.450 --> 04:25:16.460 align:start position:0%
would put the bill in danger
 
04:25:21.170 --> 04:25:21.180 align:start position:0%
and I want to understand that my role I
 
04:25:24.769 --> 04:25:24.779 align:start position:0%
believe our role is to make
 
04:25:24.779 --> 04:25:26.210 align:start position:0%
believe our role is to make
law

04:25:26.210 --> 04:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:25:29.689 --> 04:25:29.699 align:start position:0%
and then do the very best we can to be
 
04:25:32.389 --> 04:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
responsible to our constituents and then
 
04:25:34.969 --> 04:25:34.979 align:start position:0%
give it to you folks to do the rule
 
04:25:37.429 --> 04:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
making so we will do our job without
 
04:25:39.469 --> 04:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
fear or favor
 
04:25:41.450 --> 04:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to make sure that was
 
04:25:43.969 --> 04:25:43.979 align:start position:0%
understood sure my comment was based on
 
04:25:45.349 --> 04:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
the fact
 
04:25:45.359 --> 04:25:46.130 align:start position:0%
the fact
um

04:25:46.130 --> 04:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:49.670 --> 04:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
I am very confident that this could go
 
04:25:51.769 --> 04:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
all the way through including having the
 
04:25:54.769 --> 04:25:54.779 align:start position:0%
governor support the bill as written and
 
04:25:56.809 --> 04:25:56.819 align:start position:0%
as amended the current version of the
 
04:26:00.950 --> 04:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
bill any alteration of that and
 
04:26:00.960 --> 04:26:01.670 align:start position:0%
bill any alteration of that and
um

04:26:01.670 --> 04:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:04.809 --> 04:26:04.819 align:start position:0%
I am concerned that and have been
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
authorized to let folks know that a
 
04:26:09.170 --> 04:26:09.180 align:start position:0%
concerned that it could make it all the
 
04:26:11.870 --> 04:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
way through the this process
 
04:26:14.809 --> 04:26:14.819 align:start position:0%
and with respect sir that's not my
 
04:26:18.290 --> 04:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
concern oh no it doesn't have to be I'm
 
04:26:20.689 --> 04:26:20.699 align:start position:0%
just here to let folks know I've been we
 
04:26:22.429 --> 04:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
have gone through this process over the
 
04:26:24.590 --> 04:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
last couple of months where we have been
 
04:26:26.689 --> 04:26:26.699 align:start position:0%
given the fact that of how close the
 
04:26:28.429 --> 04:26:28.439 align:start position:0%
bill came last session a bill came and
 
04:26:30.429 --> 04:26:30.439 align:start position:0%
it ended up being vetoed by the governor
 
04:26:33.769 --> 04:26:33.779 align:start position:0%
and and not moving forward we have been
 
04:26:35.990 --> 04:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
asked to be as clear as possible about
 
04:26:38.570 --> 04:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
what we believe is a bill Des can
 
04:26:40.550 --> 04:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
support and something that can have the
 
04:26:42.969 --> 04:26:42.979 align:start position:0%
support all the way so it can become law
 
04:26:46.070 --> 04:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
and so we are being as transparent as
 
04:26:48.790 --> 04:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
possible every time we get up about
 
04:26:51.889 --> 04:26:51.899 align:start position:0%
what what has the possible what we
 
04:26:53.689 --> 04:26:53.699 align:start position:0%
believe has the possibility of
 
04:26:55.849 --> 04:26:55.859 align:start position:0%
successfully being making it through the
 
04:26:59.750 --> 04:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
whole process and I am confident the
 
04:27:01.849 --> 04:27:01.859 align:start position:0%
current version of the bill would be
 
04:27:04.849 --> 04:27:04.859 align:start position:0%
able to do that amendments at this point
 
04:27:04.859 --> 04:27:06.830 align:start position:0%
able to do that amendments at this point
would

04:27:06.830 --> 04:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:27:08.990 --> 04:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
be a challenge to be able to see
 
04:27:10.490 --> 04:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
something successfully happen this
 
04:27:10.500 --> 04:27:12.769 align:start position:0%
something successfully happen this
session

04:27:12.769 --> 04:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:15.229 --> 04:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby thank you madam
 
04:27:21.050 --> 04:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
chair uh so what is uh if this bill does
 
04:27:22.429 --> 04:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
not pass
 
04:27:26.269 --> 04:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
then uh how will so I believe that that
 
04:27:29.570 --> 04:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
the current rules expire in 2020 in July
 
04:27:29.580 --> 04:27:31.309 align:start position:0%
the current rules expire in 2020 in July
2024

04:27:31.309 --> 04:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
2024
 
04:27:37.370 --> 04:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
uh so uh how do you how Des deal with uh
 
04:27:39.590 --> 04:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking on this if this bill does
 
04:27:41.450 --> 04:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
not pass
 
04:27:42.950 --> 04:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question so you're
 
04:27:45.590 --> 04:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
correct the the solid waste rules as a
 
04:27:48.950 --> 04:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
group and they are inch and a half thick
 
04:27:51.170 --> 04:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
um with about 21 chapters
 
04:27:54.110 --> 04:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
um do expire on July 1 of 2024. we have
 
04:27:57.290 --> 04:27:57.300 align:start position:0%
embarked on a uh rule making uh plan
 
04:27:59.450 --> 04:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
that includes taking a few chapters at a
 
04:28:02.030 --> 04:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
time one of those chapters is chapter
 
04:28:04.429 --> 04:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
800 chapter 800 is the is the chapter
 
04:28:07.010 --> 04:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
that governs how we permit and and
 
04:28:09.170 --> 04:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
regulate landfills so it contains a lot
 
04:28:11.030 --> 04:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
more than just citing criteria and
 
04:28:13.670 --> 04:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
citing information so we are we actually
 
04:28:15.649 --> 04:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
already had a listening session on that
 
04:28:18.349 --> 04:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
chapter early in March uh we had a
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
public comment period and we received
 
04:28:21.170 --> 04:28:21.180 align:start position:0%
some comments it was very well attended
 
04:28:22.910 --> 04:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
we have about 70 participants on a
 
04:28:25.370 --> 04:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
remote listening session and we also
 
04:28:26.570 --> 04:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
presented at the beginning of that
 
04:28:28.429 --> 04:28:28.439 align:start position:0%
listening session some ideas we had for
 
04:28:31.550 --> 04:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
changes to the chapter and we are
 
04:28:33.530 --> 04:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
working on those rules now understanding
 
04:28:35.510 --> 04:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
that this bill is in play right now we
 
04:28:37.010 --> 04:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
have said and we said they're in that
 
04:28:39.950 --> 04:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
listening session that um we will be
 
04:28:42.710 --> 04:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
working on potential of on proposed
 
04:28:44.870 --> 04:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
amendments to 800 but we will not
 
04:28:47.149 --> 04:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
address the topic of setbacks until we
 
04:28:49.670 --> 04:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
know whether whether this bill Pat this
 
04:28:52.370 --> 04:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
bill is to pass the the rules still
 
04:28:55.490 --> 04:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
expire in July of 24 so we will adopt
 
04:28:57.590 --> 04:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
the rules as they're currently are with
 
04:28:59.570 --> 04:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
any changes that we make the citing
 
04:29:01.429 --> 04:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
criteria would at least with respect to
 
04:29:03.170 --> 04:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
surface water would largely remain the
 
04:29:05.030 --> 04:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
same and then we go ahead and get them
 
04:29:07.610 --> 04:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
through the rulemaking process get them
 
04:29:09.110 --> 04:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
passed and make sure that we have a rule
 
04:29:10.610 --> 04:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
because we let them expire we don't do
 
04:29:12.290 --> 04:29:12.300 align:start position:0%
anything we don't have a rule anymore so
 
04:29:13.969 --> 04:29:13.979 align:start position:0%
we don't have rules to govern how we
 
04:29:15.590 --> 04:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
regulate landfills and that's not an
 
04:29:17.809 --> 04:29:17.819 align:start position:0%
acceptable situation to us so we will
 
04:29:21.710 --> 04:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
have rules renewed by July of 24. then
 
04:29:23.870 --> 04:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
if the bill does pass then we will be
 
04:29:25.670 --> 04:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
concurrently working on the specific
 
04:29:27.889 --> 04:29:27.899 align:start position:0%
rulemaking to address surface water
 
04:29:30.110 --> 04:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
setbacks consistent with the language in
 
04:29:32.510 --> 04:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
the bill and then we would amend chapter
 
04:29:35.929 --> 04:29:35.939 align:start position:0%
800 Again by July or by the summer of 25
 
04:29:38.630 --> 04:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
by that 24 month period if the bill
 
04:29:41.269 --> 04:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass then we could certainly
 
04:29:43.670 --> 04:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
look look at potential changes to the
 
04:29:46.670 --> 04:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
rule in the absence of the bill and
 
04:29:48.710 --> 04:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
would be at Liberty to do that at any
 
04:29:51.590 --> 04:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
time we can always propose rulemaking
 
04:29:53.630 --> 04:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
and go through the rulemaking process
 
04:29:55.969 --> 04:29:55.979 align:start position:0%
that's been discussed here
 
04:29:59.030 --> 04:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
but the only thing I'll add is uh the
 
04:30:01.670 --> 04:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
reason we're supportive of this is we
 
04:30:02.809 --> 04:30:02.819 align:start position:0%
think this would lead to a better
 
04:30:05.809 --> 04:30:05.819 align:start position:0%
process for these parts of our rules
 
04:30:08.510 --> 04:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
um but if if nothing happens we'll just
 
04:30:11.389 --> 04:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
move it'll be included in the overall
 
04:30:13.550 --> 04:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
update that we're in the process of
 
04:30:15.469 --> 04:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
going through
 
04:30:18.469 --> 04:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
04:30:20.330 --> 04:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
the question is oh thank you madam chair
 
04:30:23.030 --> 04:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you for answering my question
 
04:30:24.950 --> 04:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
um this question is not a reflection of
 
04:30:27.229 --> 04:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
our trust in your ability to complete
 
04:30:30.349 --> 04:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
the the requirements of the bill but
 
04:30:30.359 --> 04:30:31.309 align:start position:0%
the the requirements of the bill but
doesn't

04:30:31.309 --> 04:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
04:30:34.790 --> 04:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
um the reversion to the old rules in
 
04:30:40.929 --> 04:30:40.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:43.130 --> 04:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for the if I understand your
 
04:30:44.330 --> 04:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
question I think I use the term
 
04:30:47.809 --> 04:30:47.819 align:start position:0%
open-ended meaning that um for from an
 
04:30:50.510 --> 04:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
applicant's perspective they could be in
 
04:30:52.429 --> 04:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
a situation where they would not have
 
04:30:53.929 --> 04:30:53.939 align:start position:0%
any idea when they were going to get a
 
04:30:53.939 --> 04:30:54.830 align:start position:0%
any idea when they were going to get a
decision

04:30:54.830 --> 04:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:30:56.809 --> 04:30:56.819 align:start position:0%
so no if if you went to the current
 
04:30:59.090 --> 04:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
rules Then There It Is Clear when then
 
04:31:00.889 --> 04:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
they would get a decision
 
04:31:03.050 --> 04:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
can I have a follow-up sure
 
04:31:04.849 --> 04:31:04.859 align:start position:0%
um well I guess that's that's my
 
04:31:06.590 --> 04:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
question is if we were if you had
 
04:31:08.630 --> 04:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
applicants in the queue who were waiting
 
04:31:10.670 --> 04:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
for the outcomes of the of the of the
 
04:31:12.649 --> 04:31:12.659 align:start position:0%
rules that and you did not meet that
 
04:31:17.030 --> 04:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
two-year rule would would they go would
 
04:31:18.830 --> 04:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
you could still consider applications
 
04:31:21.110 --> 04:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
under the old rules
 
04:31:23.870 --> 04:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
the way I understand the bill if if we
 
04:31:27.050 --> 04:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
fail to meet that 24-month Target and we
 
04:31:28.729 --> 04:31:28.739 align:start position:0%
already have an application that's come
 
04:31:31.849 --> 04:31:31.859 align:start position:0%
before us what the bill let's say we got
 
04:31:33.590 --> 04:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
an application tomorrow and this bill
 
04:31:36.050 --> 04:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
were to pass then the direction that the
 
04:31:37.790 --> 04:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
agency has given under this bill is that
 
04:31:40.610 --> 04:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
we process that application the way we
 
04:31:41.870 --> 04:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
always would which means we do a
 
04:31:43.670 --> 04:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
completeness determination and once it's
 
04:31:45.590 --> 04:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
determined complete we do a full
 
04:31:47.389 --> 04:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
technical review we have a public
 
04:31:50.149 --> 04:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
hearing and then we would be prepared to
 
04:31:52.610 --> 04:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
render a decision on on the application
 
04:31:55.250 --> 04:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
under the provisions of this bill we
 
04:31:56.929 --> 04:31:56.939 align:start position:0%
would hold that decision in advance
 
04:31:59.450 --> 04:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
until the rules are completed and then
 
04:32:01.130 --> 04:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
the applicant would be directed to file
 
04:32:02.870 --> 04:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
supplementary information to their
 
04:32:06.349 --> 04:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
application to demonstrate how the
 
04:32:09.349 --> 04:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
application meets the new newly adopted
 
04:32:11.750 --> 04:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
citing Rule and then we would proceed to
 
04:32:15.290 --> 04:32:15.300 align:start position:0%
to issuing a decision on the application
 
04:32:18.469 --> 04:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
if I'm sorry thank you yeah I mean I
 
04:32:20.450 --> 04:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
think the bottom line is is what makes
 
04:32:23.110 --> 04:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
describing you know
 
04:32:26.090 --> 04:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
we understand the the Mandate of this
 
04:32:29.090 --> 04:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
legislation is to update this Rule and
 
04:32:32.929 --> 04:32:32.939 align:start position:0%
we would uh we wouldn't to move forward
 
04:32:34.969 --> 04:32:34.979 align:start position:0%
with an application
 
04:32:37.969 --> 04:32:37.979 align:start position:0%
um even if it we hit 26 months until the
 
04:32:40.010 --> 04:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
new rule is in and have it applied to
 
04:32:42.290 --> 04:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
the application
 
04:32:42.300 --> 04:32:45.889 align:start position:0%
the application
foreign

04:32:45.889 --> 04:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:48.469 --> 04:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
representative germana thank you very
 
04:32:49.910 --> 04:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair
 
04:32:51.889 --> 04:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
um I want to kind of underscore points
 
04:32:53.750 --> 04:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
of Representative Haskins made and to
 
04:32:55.010 --> 04:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
also speak for myself and say it's
 
04:32:57.469 --> 04:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
frustrating to to have it suggested that
 
04:32:59.570 --> 04:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
the bill were presented with is it take
 
04:33:01.550 --> 04:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
it or leave it option that's that's not
 
04:33:03.530 --> 04:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
how the legislative process is intended
 
04:33:05.650 --> 04:33:05.660 align:start position:0%
to work and and it's like
 
04:33:09.289 --> 04:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
with how would the suggestion that the
 
04:33:10.670 --> 04:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton made which
 
04:33:12.109 --> 04:33:12.119 align:start position:0%
which makes sense to me which is the
 
04:33:14.631 --> 04:33:14.641 align:start position:0%
elimination of that part of line seven
 
04:33:17.689 --> 04:33:17.699 align:start position:0%
which is the reversion to older rules
 
04:33:20.029 --> 04:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
how does that uh all how would that
 
04:33:21.949 --> 04:33:21.959 align:start position:0%
alter this bill in a way that would make
 
04:33:23.750 --> 04:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
it so objectionable that it would no
 
04:33:25.250 --> 04:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
longer get the governor's signature
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
supposedly so let me answer the first
 
04:33:32.090 --> 04:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:36.051 --> 04:33:36.061 align:start position:0%
I it is it is not in my intent to
 
04:33:39.349 --> 04:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
put into back anyone in the corner it is
 
04:33:43.551 --> 04:33:43.561 align:start position:0%
only my intent be to be given the way
 
04:33:46.670 --> 04:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
the last session ended and how the veto
 
04:33:49.849 --> 04:33:49.859 align:start position:0%
came into play we were asked by folks to
 
04:33:52.551 --> 04:33:52.561 align:start position:0%
be as crystal clear as possess as
 
04:33:55.131 --> 04:33:55.141 align:start position:0%
possible during the process to be clear
 
04:33:56.689 --> 04:33:56.699 align:start position:0%
about what we thought could eventually
 
04:33:58.789 --> 04:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
be successful we make it all the way
 
04:34:01.189 --> 04:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
through so that is all I am trying to do
 
04:34:04.369 --> 04:34:04.379 align:start position:0%
is to be as honest as possible about
 
04:34:07.551 --> 04:34:07.561 align:start position:0%
what we have been told about Ken it
 
04:34:10.609 --> 04:34:10.619 align:start position:0%
works for everyone involved in in this
 
04:34:13.189 --> 04:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
process that is it you all have to do
 
04:34:16.849 --> 04:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
your job I respect that and I respect
 
04:34:18.709 --> 04:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
um you all need to decide what is in the
 
04:34:20.390 --> 04:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
best interest your constituents in the
 
04:34:20.400 --> 04:34:21.170 align:start position:0%
best interest your constituents in the
state

04:34:21.170 --> 04:34:21.180 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:34:24.890 --> 04:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
I'm only here to be as transparent as
 
04:34:26.929 --> 04:34:26.939 align:start position:0%
possible about what would happen later
 
04:34:29.090 --> 04:34:29.100 align:start position:0%
on in the process depending on how it
 
04:34:31.789 --> 04:34:31.799 align:start position:0%
turns out that is my only goal so I have
 
04:34:35.269 --> 04:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
a question now yeah um well I well there
 
04:34:36.470 --> 04:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
was representative a second question
 
04:34:38.570 --> 04:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
about the elimination of the language
 
04:34:38.580 --> 04:34:40.189 align:start position:0%
about the elimination of the language
okay

04:34:40.189 --> 04:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:34:41.929 --> 04:34:41.939 align:start position:0%
um why don't you finish that and then I
 
04:34:44.330 --> 04:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
04:34:46.551 --> 04:34:46.561 align:start position:0%
can you
 
04:34:48.769 --> 04:34:48.779 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry can you repeat that well just
 
04:34:52.670 --> 04:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
I it eliminated yeah how how eliminating
 
04:34:54.709 --> 04:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
the part that says we revert to the old
 
04:34:57.289 --> 04:34:57.299 align:start position:0%
rule if if and and I take you know I
 
04:34:58.490 --> 04:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
think you guys do a great job and I
 
04:35:00.170 --> 04:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
assume it will be done in 24 months is
 
04:35:01.551 --> 04:35:01.561 align:start position:0%
another reason why I don't think we need
 
04:35:03.410 --> 04:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
to have this statement that it's going
 
04:35:04.429 --> 04:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
to revert to the old rules because
 
04:35:06.470 --> 04:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
you'll have it done but how would the
 
04:35:08.269 --> 04:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
removal of that make this objectionable
 
04:35:10.310 --> 04:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
to the point where it might not pass I I
 
04:35:12.051 --> 04:35:12.061 align:start position:0%
think it goes to that issue where there
 
04:35:13.490 --> 04:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
are a lot of parties with opposing
 
04:35:15.590 --> 04:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
interests here that are on board with
 
04:35:18.051 --> 04:35:18.061 align:start position:0%
this bill as it's drafted and one or
 
04:35:20.330 --> 04:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
more of those may walk if that's changed
 
04:35:22.849 --> 04:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
that's that's all I can offer
 
04:35:25.789 --> 04:35:25.799 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much so my question
 
04:35:28.910 --> 04:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
is I've seen in the past
 
04:35:31.010 --> 04:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
especially with Des
 
04:35:34.070 --> 04:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
um and I know that there there were
 
04:35:35.869 --> 04:35:35.879 align:start position:0%
rules regarding
 
04:35:37.670 --> 04:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
another bill that I was working on
 
04:35:42.051 --> 04:35:42.061 align:start position:0%
having to do with um grease traps in the
 
04:35:42.061 --> 04:35:42.949 align:start position:0%
having to do with um grease traps in the
ES

04:35:42.949 --> 04:35:42.959 align:start position:0%
ES
 
04:35:45.890 --> 04:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
and rules are currently being drafted
 
04:35:47.449 --> 04:35:47.459 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:35:51.170 --> 04:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
and the way I was left to understand is
 
04:35:54.551 --> 04:35:54.561 align:start position:0%
that anybody who was in a situation that
 
04:35:56.810 --> 04:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
required a grease trap would be
 
04:36:00.170 --> 04:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
evaluated as if those new rules were
 
04:36:02.289 --> 04:36:02.299 align:start position:0%
already adopted
 
04:36:06.590 --> 04:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
why is that not an option here that if
 
04:36:09.170 --> 04:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
you already know what those new rules
 
04:36:11.330 --> 04:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
are but you're still going through the
 
04:36:13.131 --> 04:36:13.141 align:start position:0%
administrative process of putting them
 
04:36:16.490 --> 04:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
through gel car that you cannot
 
04:36:20.209 --> 04:36:20.219 align:start position:0%
apply those until those rules are set in
 
04:36:20.219 --> 04:36:21.170 align:start position:0%
apply those until those rules are set in
stone

04:36:21.170 --> 04:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
stone
 
04:36:23.689 --> 04:36:23.699 align:start position:0%
I think that's a legal question I I will
 
04:36:25.970 --> 04:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
I will offer an answer I I don't know
 
04:36:27.470 --> 04:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
the specifics of that particular
 
04:36:29.810 --> 04:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
situation I'm going to guess what the
 
04:36:33.470 --> 04:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
agency said was rather than put a party
 
04:36:35.390 --> 04:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
who is going to be regulated by an
 
04:36:37.670 --> 04:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
expected oncoming rule in a position
 
04:36:40.131 --> 04:36:40.141 align:start position:0%
where they where they where they weren't
 
04:36:41.869 --> 04:36:41.879 align:start position:0%
going to be compliant that they would
 
04:36:43.551 --> 04:36:43.561 align:start position:0%
you know approach their application
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
review to make sure that not only they
 
04:36:46.910 --> 04:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
meet the current requirements but they
 
04:36:48.289 --> 04:36:48.299 align:start position:0%
meet the new requirements that are
 
04:36:48.299 --> 04:36:49.429 align:start position:0%
meet the new requirements that are
anticipated

04:36:49.429 --> 04:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
anticipated
 
04:36:51.349 --> 04:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
it's another question entirely to say
 
04:36:53.631 --> 04:36:53.641 align:start position:0%
whether the agency could legally enforce
 
04:36:56.330 --> 04:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
that so you know if someone said I want
 
04:36:57.949 --> 04:36:57.959 align:start position:0%
this grease trap under the current rules
 
04:36:59.449 --> 04:36:59.459 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to operate it until things
 
04:37:01.189 --> 04:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
change that way I don't think there'd be
 
04:37:03.590 --> 04:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
much we could say I mean I think I I'm
 
04:37:05.269 --> 04:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
pretty confident that there are lots of
 
04:37:06.590 --> 04:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
folks in the legislature who would be
 
04:37:08.929 --> 04:37:08.939 align:start position:0%
very upset with Des if we started
 
04:37:10.670 --> 04:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
enforcing rules that weren't rules yet
 
04:37:12.109 --> 04:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
and that's what I think you've just
 
04:37:13.369 --> 04:37:13.379 align:start position:0%
described okay
 
04:37:16.131 --> 04:37:16.141 align:start position:0%
fair enough and and one other thing I
 
04:37:18.529 --> 04:37:18.539 align:start position:0%
want to add because as the Director said
 
04:37:20.449 --> 04:37:20.459 align:start position:0%
if this bill doesn't pass and nothing
 
04:37:22.789 --> 04:37:22.799 align:start position:0%
passed the decision we'll just
 
04:37:25.670 --> 04:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
incorporate this in the overall overall
 
04:37:28.551 --> 04:37:28.561 align:start position:0%
rule making process we are undertaking
 
04:37:28.561 --> 04:37:31.429 align:start position:0%
rule making process we are undertaking
we

04:37:31.429 --> 04:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:37:33.010 --> 04:37:33.020 align:start position:0%
after last session
 
04:37:35.689 --> 04:37:35.699 align:start position:0%
we brought we started to talk to the
 
04:37:37.910 --> 04:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders about something how could
 
04:37:40.010 --> 04:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
we do how could we put a piece of
 
04:37:42.529 --> 04:37:42.539 align:start position:0%
legislation together that
 
04:37:44.949 --> 04:37:44.959 align:start position:0%
offered more transparency to the process
 
04:37:47.449 --> 04:37:47.459 align:start position:0%
we're aware there are some folks who are
 
04:37:50.510 --> 04:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about the es and
 
04:37:51.949 --> 04:37:51.959 align:start position:0%
um you know the relationship we have
 
04:37:54.410 --> 04:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
with some of the folks we regulate and
 
04:37:57.289 --> 04:37:57.299 align:start position:0%
and that interaction so this was
 
04:38:00.470 --> 04:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
actually an attempt to increase the
 
04:38:03.230 --> 04:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
transparency of the process to have a
 
04:38:05.230 --> 04:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
third party that would get public
 
04:38:07.789 --> 04:38:07.799 align:start position:0%
comments about the scope of what that
 
04:38:10.070 --> 04:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
would look at of bringing in other data
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
and information to have a more thorough
 
04:38:15.109 --> 04:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
process than just the traditional
 
04:38:18.709 --> 04:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process so the reason we
 
04:38:20.750 --> 04:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
brought this forward was we wanted to
 
04:38:22.609 --> 04:38:22.619 align:start position:0%
increase the credibility of the process
 
04:38:24.230 --> 04:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to increase the
 
04:38:26.209 --> 04:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
transparency and we wanted to increase
 
04:38:28.070 --> 04:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
the amount of information that could be
 
04:38:30.849 --> 04:38:30.859 align:start position:0%
gathered and the opportunity folks to
 
04:38:34.310 --> 04:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
consume that information comment on it
 
04:38:38.090 --> 04:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
and and have their opinion be heard so
 
04:38:41.510 --> 04:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
um the irony is the this legislation was
 
04:38:44.390 --> 04:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
was thought to actually
 
04:38:47.449 --> 04:38:47.459 align:start position:0%
um uh be a win and and and give
 
04:38:49.429 --> 04:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
confidence to the folks who have
 
04:38:51.949 --> 04:38:51.959 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
04:38:55.189 --> 04:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
um landfills and how they're cited so uh
 
04:38:57.470 --> 04:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
just a little more larger background on
 
04:38:59.750 --> 04:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
on why we're doing this way instead of
 
04:39:02.090 --> 04:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
not just going right to rulemaking this
 
04:39:04.849 --> 04:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
adds layers and opportunity for
 
04:39:06.650 --> 04:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
interaction with the public it adds
 
04:39:08.150 --> 04:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
layers and
 
04:39:10.730 --> 04:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
um of information and
 
04:39:13.250 --> 04:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
um we would hope that that would mean it
 
04:39:14.750 --> 04:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
would be turn out for a better product
 
04:39:16.551 --> 04:39:16.561 align:start position:0%
for all of us including in the
 
04:39:16.561 --> 04:39:18.590 align:start position:0%
for all of us including in the
department

04:39:18.590 --> 04:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:39:22.250 --> 04:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Potenza and
 
04:39:25.789 --> 04:39:25.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:28.910 --> 04:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so on
 
04:39:32.510 --> 04:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
page five I don't understand why the
 
04:39:34.490 --> 04:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
whole line three there if the department
 
04:39:36.230 --> 04:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
does not that whole thing should be
 
04:39:38.930 --> 04:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
removed based upon what you just said in
 
04:39:41.750 --> 04:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
regards with transparency we say on the
 
04:39:44.030 --> 04:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
page before it has to be done in 24
 
04:39:46.190 --> 04:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
months we're saying something has to be
 
04:39:49.250 --> 04:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
done it's great we're all about this it
 
04:39:51.110 --> 04:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense that whole paragraph
 
04:39:54.770 --> 04:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:57.708 --> 04:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have a what if it just it I
 
04:39:58.788 --> 04:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
know there's other people that have
 
04:40:00.470 --> 04:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
commented on this I just it doesn't need
 
04:40:04.190 --> 04:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:06.288 --> 04:40:06.298 align:start position:0%
I don't want to be obtuse but I'm not
 
04:40:07.730 --> 04:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
sure there's a question I'm happy to
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:13.550 --> 04:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
why does it why are you saying that has
 
04:40:14.630 --> 04:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
to be there
 
04:40:17.510 --> 04:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
you're saying it on the page before it
 
04:40:20.270 --> 04:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
has to be completed in 24 months
 
04:40:22.310 --> 04:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
and also number seven has to happen
 
04:40:25.190 --> 04:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
first the whole 150 000 that all has to
 
04:40:27.708 --> 04:40:27.718 align:start position:0%
happen first okay so nothing's going to
 
04:40:30.230 --> 04:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
rules or jail car until the number
 
04:40:32.570 --> 04:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
seven's done so I just don't understand
 
04:40:35.448 --> 04:40:35.458 align:start position:0%
why we're saying it's like you know it's
 
04:40:37.430 --> 04:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
to me it's like setting it up to fail I
 
04:40:39.530 --> 04:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
just feel as if we're saying it has to
 
04:40:42.350 --> 04:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
be done in 24 months on you know June
 
04:40:45.170 --> 04:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
30th 2023 we're gonna
 
04:40:48.530 --> 04:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
do the you know take in the rfps for the
 
04:40:50.868 --> 04:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
150 000.
 
04:40:52.550 --> 04:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why we can't remove
 
04:40:55.010 --> 04:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
that tell me why we can't remove that I
 
04:40:56.868 --> 04:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
think it goes to this this I think it's
 
04:40:58.010 --> 04:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
the same answer that I gave
 
04:41:00.410 --> 04:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
representative germano I think it's that
 
04:41:02.750 --> 04:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
that there are parties who won't support
 
04:41:07.270 --> 04:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:10.788 --> 04:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
uh yeah sure but what parties
 
04:41:12.830 --> 04:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
you know the other gentleman said you
 
04:41:14.510 --> 04:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
know he talked about his stakeholders
 
04:41:17.208 --> 04:41:17.218 align:start position:0%
who who were these parties
 
04:41:19.070 --> 04:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
who are these stakeholders I'd like to
 
04:41:19.080 --> 04:41:25.730 align:start position:0%
who are these stakeholders I'd like to
know

04:41:25.730 --> 04:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:28.010 --> 04:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
as well as Des is to bring forward what
 
04:41:28.850 --> 04:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
we think
 
04:41:30.770 --> 04:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
answer questions about what we think
 
04:41:33.590 --> 04:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
would work best for
 
04:41:35.448 --> 04:41:35.458 align:start position:0%
um our process
 
04:41:35.458 --> 04:41:37.910 align:start position:0%
um our process
and

04:41:37.910 --> 04:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:41:43.788 --> 04:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
and so we we contributed to the process
 
04:41:46.550 --> 04:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of Des
 
04:41:48.730 --> 04:41:48.740 align:start position:0%
as I said at the end of the last session
 
04:41:51.650 --> 04:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
we were criticized for not being more
 
04:41:54.470 --> 04:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
transparent about what we thought could
 
04:41:56.628 --> 04:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
and couldn't be successfully make it all
 
04:41:59.930 --> 04:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
the way through the process so
 
04:42:05.090 --> 04:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
I am all and this isn't Mike this is all
 
04:42:07.910 --> 04:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
I am all I was here to do today was to
 
04:42:09.830 --> 04:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
let folks know that
 
04:42:12.410 --> 04:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
version of this bill that's in front
 
04:42:16.250 --> 04:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
has the support needed to make it all
 
04:42:18.170 --> 04:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
the way through the process this is
 
04:42:18.180 --> 04:42:19.250 align:start position:0%
the way through the process this is
amended

04:42:19.250 --> 04:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
amended
 
04:42:22.128 --> 04:42:22.138 align:start position:0%
it'll be up to it'll be up to the Senate
 
04:42:24.650 --> 04:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
whether they want to pass the other
 
04:42:26.990 --> 04:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
version and it'll be up to the governor
 
04:42:29.750 --> 04:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
whatever version gets to his desk if
 
04:42:32.270 --> 04:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
he's going to sign it or not I was
 
04:42:34.690 --> 04:42:34.700 align:start position:0%
simply saying
 
04:42:37.128 --> 04:42:37.138 align:start position:0%
this is a version of the bill and a
 
04:42:39.948 --> 04:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
process that DS can support we're
 
04:42:42.350 --> 04:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
publicly saying we can support that and
 
04:42:44.270 --> 04:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
we're probably saying we believe it
 
04:42:45.708 --> 04:42:45.718 align:start position:0%
would have the broad-based support it
 
04:42:47.208 --> 04:42:47.218 align:start position:0%
would need it to be able to come to law
 
04:42:49.070 --> 04:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
if you all
 
04:42:51.470 --> 04:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
feel that something else is needs to
 
04:42:53.150 --> 04:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
happen to the bill
 
04:42:56.570 --> 04:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
the process will continue we'll make our
 
04:42:58.490 --> 04:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
comments on the updated version of the
 
04:43:00.650 --> 04:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
bill and we'll see how the process plays
 
04:43:04.430 --> 04:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:07.610 --> 04:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
representative Dusty
 
04:43:09.170 --> 04:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:43:11.330 --> 04:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh representative
 
04:43:14.448 --> 04:43:14.458 align:start position:0%
pretenza um kind of hit on my question
 
04:43:18.830 --> 04:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
but we know that our stakeholders are
 
04:43:20.930 --> 04:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
our constituents as as legislators and
 
04:43:24.470 --> 04:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
they want clean water okay uh you have
 
04:43:26.750 --> 04:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
used the word stakeholder a number of
 
04:43:30.170 --> 04:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
times and in you know
 
04:43:33.770 --> 04:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
um uh for transparency reasons
 
04:43:36.230 --> 04:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's is it possible for you to talk
 
04:43:39.110 --> 04:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
about who your stakeholders are because
 
04:43:41.810 --> 04:43:41.820 align:start position:0%
from what I see there's only one
 
04:43:43.970 --> 04:43:43.980 align:start position:0%
stakeholder that has any power at all
 
04:43:46.070 --> 04:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
and that's the governor so if there are
 
04:43:48.110 --> 04:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in this process there must
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
be other people that are applying
 
04:43:52.970 --> 04:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
pressure so it'd be really nice to know
 
04:43:54.708 --> 04:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
who they are yeah I mean I was nominated
 
04:43:57.530 --> 04:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
by the governor so I mean he's my boss
 
04:44:00.650 --> 04:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
so uh so that has a part of it of course
 
04:44:02.330 --> 04:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
she's one of my stakeholders in one of
 
04:44:04.430 --> 04:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
the department stakeholders is the chief
 
04:44:06.350 --> 04:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
executive officer of the state
 
04:44:06.360 --> 04:44:07.850 align:start position:0%
executive officer of the state
government

04:44:07.850 --> 04:44:07.860 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:44:10.910 --> 04:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
um and uh we work together on
 
04:44:15.410 --> 04:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
legislation of uh we get his advice on
 
04:44:18.530 --> 04:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
the policy he'd like to see come out of
 
04:44:20.448 --> 04:44:20.458 align:start position:0%
legislation and he gets Our advice on
 
04:44:23.030 --> 04:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
the technical impacts and
 
04:44:25.310 --> 04:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
um and our thoughts on the policy so we
 
04:44:26.990 --> 04:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
work with the governor to make sure
 
04:44:29.990 --> 04:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
we're moving forward with policy that is
 
04:44:31.868 --> 04:44:31.878 align:start position:0%
going to work for the executive branch
 
04:44:35.448 --> 04:44:35.458 align:start position:0%
but our stakeholders include include the
 
04:44:37.190 --> 04:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
listing legislature the executive
 
04:44:40.490 --> 04:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
Council the residents of the state the
 
04:44:43.550 --> 04:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
businesses of the state the uh the
 
04:44:45.590 --> 04:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
communities we regulate
 
04:44:48.110 --> 04:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
um while we are The Regulators we find
 
04:44:50.628 --> 04:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
it that having a an approach of
 
04:44:53.868 --> 04:44:53.878 align:start position:0%
cooperation and communication
 
04:44:55.430 --> 04:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
um leads to better outcomes for all
 
04:44:55.440 --> 04:44:57.050 align:start position:0%
um leads to better outcomes for all
involved

04:44:57.050 --> 04:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
involved
 
04:44:59.930 --> 04:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
um so we work for the entire State of
 
04:45:01.550 --> 04:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's residents it's
 
04:45:05.690 --> 04:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
businesses and we work with all the
 
04:45:07.010 --> 04:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
elected officials of the state
 
04:45:09.590 --> 04:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
government our sister agencies and the
 
04:45:12.650 --> 04:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
other state employees so everyone is our
 
04:45:12.660 --> 04:45:14.208 align:start position:0%
other state employees so everyone is our
stakeholder

04:45:14.208 --> 04:45:14.218 align:start position:0%
stakeholder
 
04:45:16.128 --> 04:45:16.138 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:45:19.730 --> 04:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
um yes the the the again
 
04:45:21.890 --> 04:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
my only goal is
 
04:45:24.470 --> 04:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
is you know it's it's you know it's it's
 
04:45:27.708 --> 04:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
a lose-lose situation last time we
 
04:45:29.810 --> 04:45:29.820 align:start position:0%
weren't as clear about what we what
 
04:45:31.128 --> 04:45:31.138 align:start position:0%
could pass and what could ultimately
 
04:45:33.288 --> 04:45:33.298 align:start position:0%
make it through the process and what we
 
04:45:35.810 --> 04:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
supported so
 
04:45:39.470 --> 04:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
um so all we are trying to do is say
 
04:45:42.110 --> 04:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
be more clear about that and that's to
 
04:45:46.250 --> 04:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
say we think this piece I am confident
 
04:45:48.490 --> 04:45:48.500 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation is something
 
04:45:51.770 --> 04:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
the department can support and voice
 
04:45:53.690 --> 04:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
their support on and it is something
 
04:45:55.788 --> 04:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
that I believe has a balance that can
 
04:45:57.730 --> 04:45:57.740 align:start position:0%
make it all the way through the process
 
04:46:01.670 --> 04:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
if if it changes then the process will
 
04:46:04.190 --> 04:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
continue to work itself out and we're
 
04:46:06.890 --> 04:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
just one we're just one part of that and
 
04:46:10.128 --> 04:46:10.138 align:start position:0%
one voice in all of that and
 
04:46:12.830 --> 04:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
um will continue to be as transparent as
 
04:46:14.868 --> 04:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
possible about what we think will lead
 
04:46:16.788 --> 04:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
to a good rulemaking process and what
 
04:46:16.798 --> 04:46:18.110 align:start position:0%
to a good rulemaking process and what
won't

04:46:18.110 --> 04:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
won't
 
04:46:21.230 --> 04:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative Bixby yeah I'd like
 
04:46:24.230 --> 04:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
to shift things a little bit um
 
04:46:27.770 --> 04:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
there was a question earlier about uh
 
04:46:29.930 --> 04:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
the uh conflicts of interest and how
 
04:46:32.330 --> 04:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
those are dealt with and I'm was
 
04:46:35.750 --> 04:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
wondering uh is there something that is
 
04:46:38.628 --> 04:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
currently in department rules or in the
 
04:46:41.150 --> 04:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
statutes that govern the department that
 
04:46:43.250 --> 04:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
lay out how conflicts of interest are
 
04:46:46.910 --> 04:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
assessed and dealt with so this is uh
 
04:46:49.310 --> 04:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
this is uh what I think I can commit to
 
04:46:51.948 --> 04:46:51.958 align:start position:0%
we will work with the Attorney General's
 
04:46:54.948 --> 04:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
office and their they you know you know
 
04:46:58.490 --> 04:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
they we have template language for rfps
 
04:47:00.948 --> 04:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
and then we have the ability to add in
 
04:47:03.470 --> 04:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
we will work with the Attorney General's
 
04:47:05.750 --> 04:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
office on Crafting conflict of interest
 
04:47:08.868 --> 04:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
language that'll go into the RFP
 
04:47:11.930 --> 04:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
as we stated earlier that RFP is going
 
04:47:14.570 --> 04:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
to have public comment if the language
 
04:47:17.090 --> 04:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
isn't sufficient we will take all the
 
04:47:20.270 --> 04:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
comments related to that and amend
 
04:47:23.090 --> 04:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
appropriately as long as we get approval
 
04:47:24.708 --> 04:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
from the Attorney General's office that
 
04:47:26.090 --> 04:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
it's language we can legally move
 
04:47:28.010 --> 04:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
forward with
 
04:47:29.270 --> 04:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:47:32.090 --> 04:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
what other points along the way uh is
 
04:47:36.550 --> 04:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
public interest public comment rather
 
04:47:40.850 --> 04:47:40.860 align:start position:0%
accepted and dealt with so official
 
04:47:44.030 --> 04:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
public comment periods there will be one
 
04:47:46.850 --> 04:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
when we have a a draft ready of the RFP
 
04:47:48.770 --> 04:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
that we will we will put out for public
 
04:47:50.448 --> 04:47:50.458 align:start position:0%
comment period
 
04:47:52.010 --> 04:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
um and then the next time for official
 
04:47:53.510 --> 04:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
public comment period will be during the
 
04:47:56.448 --> 04:47:56.458 align:start position:0%
rulemaking rule making process there is
 
04:47:58.750 --> 04:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
built into it a public comment period
 
04:48:02.930 --> 04:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
that being said again back to the who do
 
04:48:06.110 --> 04:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
we work for we take input every day you
 
04:48:08.990 --> 04:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
know you know as if along the way uh
 
04:48:10.730 --> 04:48:10.740 align:start position:0%
folks have concerns about how things are
 
04:48:14.090 --> 04:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
progressing we are open our door is
 
04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
always open uh and we will work with
 
04:48:20.090 --> 04:48:20.100 align:start position:0%
anyone to
 
04:48:23.570 --> 04:48:23.580 align:start position:0%
um to ensure that and address any
 
04:48:25.730 --> 04:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
concerns they have and shift something
 
04:48:28.010 --> 04:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
if the points they make
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
um is going to lead to a better process
 
04:48:32.750 --> 04:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:35.628 --> 04:48:35.638 align:start position:0%
so you've identified two points there's
 
04:48:38.090 --> 04:48:38.100 align:start position:0%
two officials within this there would be
 
04:48:40.310 --> 04:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
there'd be two official public comment
 
04:48:43.250 --> 04:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
periods there'd be one when the RFP
 
04:48:45.770 --> 04:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
draft is ready and we get public comment
 
04:48:47.810 --> 04:48:47.820 align:start position:0%
period on that and then during the
 
04:48:49.610 --> 04:48:49.620 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process there's an official
 
04:48:51.890 --> 04:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
public comment period as part of that
 
04:48:51.900 --> 04:48:53.150 align:start position:0%
public comment period as part of that
process

04:48:53.150 --> 04:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:48:55.368 --> 04:48:55.378 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to make sure I
 
04:48:57.948 --> 04:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
was reading that Bill Wright myself so
 
04:49:00.230 --> 04:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
if you want to miss any other any any
 
04:49:03.770 --> 04:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
other point of public comment any other
 
04:49:06.288 --> 04:49:06.298 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Haskins
 
04:49:10.368 --> 04:49:10.378 align:start position:0%
director wimps at so my question now is
 
04:49:13.970 --> 04:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
what point along the process would the
 
04:49:17.270 --> 04:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
legislature be apprised of where you are
 
04:49:20.930 --> 04:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:23.150 --> 04:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
um well as has been discussed during the
 
04:49:25.310 --> 04:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process The Joint legislative
 
04:49:27.470 --> 04:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
committee and administrative rules is a
 
04:49:29.810 --> 04:49:29.820 align:start position:0%
key role in that when we file our
 
04:49:31.610 --> 04:49:31.620 align:start position:0%
initial proposal that's filed with the
 
04:49:33.410 --> 04:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
office of legislative services and
 
04:49:35.510 --> 04:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
shared with the members of the committee
 
04:49:38.208 --> 04:49:38.218 align:start position:0%
um the office often gives us input very
 
04:49:40.610 --> 04:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
early on to the initial proposal we work
 
04:49:41.868 --> 04:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
with them to make sure we get things
 
04:49:43.730 --> 04:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
right and then we go to public hearing
 
04:49:46.788 --> 04:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
and then our own public hearing for the
 
04:49:50.930 --> 04:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
rules and then following that as we get
 
04:49:53.330 --> 04:49:53.340 align:start position:0%
ready to file a final proposal that
 
04:49:55.910 --> 04:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
final proposal gets reviewed by OLS in
 
04:49:57.288 --> 04:49:57.298 align:start position:0%
the in the committee and then there's a
 
04:49:59.690 --> 04:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
hearing before the committee so we get
 
04:50:01.850 --> 04:50:01.860 align:start position:0%
that's the key sort of built-in times
 
04:50:03.550 --> 04:50:03.560 align:start position:0%
when we get
 
04:50:05.990 --> 04:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
information or when we get input from
 
04:50:09.230 --> 04:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature certainly this will be a
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
completely public process the RP will be
 
04:50:12.530 --> 04:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
out for public comment we'll take
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
comments on that we'll do that and then
 
04:50:17.270 --> 04:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
we'll when that contractor is selected
 
04:50:19.310 --> 04:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
and they're doing their work we will get
 
04:50:21.708 --> 04:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
a final report there's no built-in
 
04:50:24.830 --> 04:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
public comment period final following
 
04:50:27.110 --> 04:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
the final report issuance and that is
 
04:50:29.628 --> 04:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
largely because we need to be getting
 
04:50:32.810 --> 04:50:32.820 align:start position:0%
our work underway at that time in or at
 
04:50:34.250 --> 04:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
least our will already be underway but
 
04:50:36.050 --> 04:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
we'll need to be looking at the content
 
04:50:37.670 --> 04:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
of that final report to see how it
 
04:50:39.830 --> 04:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
should inform our rulemaking but it'll
 
04:50:41.390 --> 04:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
be a public document as soon as it's
 
04:50:43.970 --> 04:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
released to us and at that point
 
04:50:45.350 --> 04:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
um the public would certainly be at
 
04:50:47.208 --> 04:50:47.218 align:start position:0%
Liberty to share any thoughts they have
 
04:50:48.948 --> 04:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
about the report and we would certainly
 
04:50:51.288 --> 04:50:51.298 align:start position:0%
be in a position to consider those as we
 
04:50:53.448 --> 04:50:53.458 align:start position:0%
as we draft our continue drafting the
 
04:50:53.458 --> 04:50:54.410 align:start position:0%
as we draft our continue drafting the
rules

04:50:54.410 --> 04:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:50:56.390 --> 04:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
so I know you directed the question to
 
04:50:59.810 --> 04:50:59.820 align:start position:0%
uh director but I'll make this offer on
 
04:51:02.510 --> 04:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
a number of other issues and uh projects
 
04:51:06.350 --> 04:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
and uh follow up on legislation
 
04:51:10.010 --> 04:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
um we do monthly update calls
 
04:51:11.690 --> 04:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
um Etc
 
04:51:13.970 --> 04:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
um if it was of interest
 
04:51:16.430 --> 04:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
um we would be happy to make part of
 
04:51:18.890 --> 04:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
this process a monthly update call to
 
04:51:20.628 --> 04:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
the legislators who are interested in
 
04:51:22.430 --> 04:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
this and any other stakeholder who's
 
04:51:25.270 --> 04:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
interested in this so we could have a a
 
04:51:28.250 --> 04:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
consistent regular update about the
 
04:51:30.050 --> 04:51:30.060 align:start position:0%
progress we're making
 
04:51:31.730 --> 04:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
um especially since the senator Waters
 
04:51:34.368 --> 04:51:34.378 align:start position:0%
pointed out part of of what is built in
 
04:51:36.650 --> 04:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
all this is there is another session and
 
04:51:38.030 --> 04:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
if there were concerns they could be
 
04:51:39.890 --> 04:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
addressed then so
 
04:51:43.788 --> 04:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
um uh we are we again our goal is for
 
04:51:45.590 --> 04:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
everyone to feel they had every
 
04:51:48.170 --> 04:51:48.180 align:start position:0%

04:52:49.430 --> 04:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
highly sensitive uh projects and issues
 
04:52:51.070 --> 04:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
where there's a lot of public interest
 
04:52:53.690 --> 04:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
we do all we can to make ourselves
 
04:52:55.670 --> 04:52:55.680 align:start position:0%

04:53:03.840 --> 04:53:07.610 align:start position:0%
to make it however works for for the

04:53:07.610 --> 04:53:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:10.128 --> 04:53:10.138 align:start position:0%
germana uh thank you very much Madam
 
04:53:12.170 --> 04:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
chair and director room set following
 
04:53:15.708 --> 04:53:15.718 align:start position:0%
the public uh input uh portion of the
 
04:53:18.770 --> 04:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
the process will there be a time when
 
04:53:21.050 --> 04:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
the department will respond to as I
 
04:53:22.430 --> 04:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
think is often the case with Federal
 
04:53:24.890 --> 04:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
kind of public uh input sessions you'll
 
04:53:27.948 --> 04:53:27.958 align:start position:0%
respond to some of the Public's like how
 
04:53:30.770 --> 04:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
is the public going to know that you
 
04:53:31.910 --> 04:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
have listened to them because there's a
 
04:53:33.590 --> 04:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
question about stakeholders is one thing
 
04:53:35.690 --> 04:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
to to hear what the public has to say
 
04:53:37.368 --> 04:53:37.378 align:start position:0%
it's another thing to demonstrate that
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
you've heard what they have to say and
 
04:53:40.970 --> 04:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
that it is in fact informing your
 
04:53:43.128 --> 04:53:43.138 align:start position:0%
process so is there a public an
 
04:53:44.990 --> 04:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to let the public know
 
04:53:47.390 --> 04:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
you've heard them sure so I I don't
 
04:53:49.550 --> 04:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
think that the the bill is drafted
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
requires specifically that a response to
 
04:53:53.628 --> 04:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
public comments be issued and that's
 
04:53:56.090 --> 04:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
actually not it's required for some of
 
04:53:57.708 --> 04:53:57.718 align:start position:0%
our permitting programs and not for
 
04:53:59.810 --> 04:53:59.820 align:start position:0%
others we in in our Solid Waste
 
04:54:01.128 --> 04:54:01.138 align:start position:0%
permitting program those who are
 
04:54:02.690 --> 04:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
familiar with our Solid Waste permit
 
04:54:04.850 --> 04:54:04.860 align:start position:0%
decisions will know that we actually
 
04:54:07.670 --> 04:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
issue a pretty detailed and lengthy
 
04:54:10.310 --> 04:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
response to public comments I'm not sure
 
04:54:12.230 --> 04:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
we would propose to do that here just
 
04:54:14.150 --> 04:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
because it takes a lot of work to do
 
04:54:16.310 --> 04:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
that and we want to be focusing our
 
04:54:18.350 --> 04:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
attention on reviewing those comments
 
04:54:19.910 --> 04:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
appropriately incorporating them into
 
04:54:22.368 --> 04:54:22.378 align:start position:0%
the final RFP and getting the RFP out
 
04:54:24.948 --> 04:54:24.958 align:start position:0%

um

04:55:02.510 --> 04:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:05.090 --> 04:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
so I'm here to talk about Senate Bill 61
 
04:55:07.670 --> 04:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
which is a good bill but it it needs a
 
04:55:09.650 --> 04:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
few tweaks and I'm going to start off
 
04:55:11.690 --> 04:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
with some advice that my dad gave me
 
04:55:15.230 --> 04:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
when I signed my first contract he said
 
04:55:18.170 --> 04:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
make sure or he said never take anyone's
 
04:55:20.810 --> 04:55:20.820 align:start position:0%
word that things will just excuse me
 
04:55:23.270 --> 04:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
that things will just happen be sure to
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
have it in writing
 
04:55:28.850 --> 04:55:28.860 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to tell you about why we
 
04:55:30.470 --> 04:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
need to strengthen guard rails in this
 
04:55:32.208 --> 04:55:32.218 align:start position:0%
bill when it comes to the health of New
 
04:55:34.070 --> 04:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and our environment
 
04:55:36.670 --> 04:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
specifically as it applies to pfas
 
04:55:39.470 --> 04:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
consider this a cautionary tale if we
 
04:55:42.050 --> 04:55:42.060 align:start position:0%
get this bill wrong
 
04:55:44.990 --> 04:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
as you know pfas is called a forever
 
04:55:46.788 --> 04:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
chemical and the reason it's called a
 
04:55:49.368 --> 04:55:49.378 align:start position:0%
forever chemical is it does not break
 
04:55:52.670 --> 04:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
down pfas is found in Burger wrappers
 
04:55:56.510 --> 04:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
pizza boxes dental floss discarded
 
04:55:59.650 --> 04:55:59.660 align:start position:0%
clothing old pots and pans
 
04:56:03.890 --> 04:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
exactly what you find in a landfill
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
you will hear from others about why some
 
04:56:08.628 --> 04:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
changes to this bill are needed and
 
04:56:11.208 --> 04:56:11.218 align:start position:0%
they're so important
 
04:56:13.970 --> 04:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to start with my story in
 
04:56:17.030 --> 04:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
2016 I heard about pfas in our town we
 
04:56:19.850 --> 04:56:19.860 align:start position:0%
had a corporate a commercial industry in
 
04:56:21.530 --> 04:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
our town that was contaminating our
 
04:56:21.540 --> 04:56:22.910 align:start position:0%
our town that was contaminating our
water

04:56:22.910 --> 04:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
water
 
04:56:26.750 --> 04:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
initially the state Des told us that
 
04:56:28.788 --> 04:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
only the residents that were within a
 
04:56:31.010 --> 04:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
half mile of this Corporation needed to
 
04:56:33.230 --> 04:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
be concerned about their water
 
04:56:35.208 --> 04:56:35.218 align:start position:0%
after doing a little bit of testing they
 
04:56:38.270 --> 04:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
said are bad it's really the people that
 
04:56:40.070 --> 04:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
live within a mile of this corporation
 
04:56:42.410 --> 04:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
that need to be concerned
 
04:56:45.530 --> 04:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
I live three miles from sancobain I had
 
04:56:47.628 --> 04:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
our private well tested and it tested so
 
04:56:49.190 --> 04:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
high we had to shut down our well
 
04:56:49.200 --> 04:56:50.690 align:start position:0%
high we had to shut down our well
immediately

04:56:50.690 --> 04:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
04:56:52.850 --> 04:56:52.860 align:start position:0%
I have six children they had been
 
04:56:54.890 --> 04:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
drinking contaminated water their entire
 
04:56:54.900 --> 04:56:55.910 align:start position:0%
drinking contaminated water their entire
lives

04:56:55.910 --> 04:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
lives
 
04:56:58.010 --> 04:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
we put in a whole house filtration
 
04:57:00.770 --> 04:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
system with reverse osmosis
 
04:57:03.288 --> 04:57:03.298 align:start position:0%
at a cost of about five thousand dollars
 
04:57:05.270 --> 04:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
and it costs five hundred dollars a year
 
04:57:08.510 --> 04:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
to maintain the filters for this system
 
04:57:10.990 --> 04:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
all of the water that we currently drink
 
04:57:14.390 --> 04:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
comes and cook with comes from bottled
 
04:57:17.330 --> 04:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
water we do not use the water from our
 
04:57:17.340 --> 04:57:18.288 align:start position:0%
water we do not use the water from our
house

04:57:18.288 --> 04:57:18.298 align:start position:0%
house
 
04:57:21.410 --> 04:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
in 2021 we had our well tested again and
 
04:57:23.270 --> 04:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
the numbers were even higher than they
 
04:57:25.550 --> 04:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
were in 2016.
 
04:57:27.590 --> 04:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
all six of my children have medical
 
04:57:30.590 --> 04:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
conditions that are associated with pfas
 
04:57:32.868 --> 04:57:32.878 align:start position:0%

my husband had a quadruple bypass in
 
04:57:45.128 --> 04:57:45.138 align:start position:0%
2019 at age
 
04:57:49.250 --> 04:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
55. that's associated with pfas
 
04:57:51.708 --> 04:57:51.718 align:start position:0%
I recently put down my fourth small dog
 
04:57:53.570 --> 04:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
due to cancer
 
04:57:56.030 --> 04:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
my doctors believe that my cancer is
 
04:57:58.788 --> 04:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
from quote environmental toxins because
 
04:58:02.810 --> 04:58:02.820 align:start position:0%
there is no code for pfas poisoning
 
04:58:04.550 --> 04:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
cincobain has said that they will hook
 
04:58:06.830 --> 04:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
our house up to public water
 
04:58:09.230 --> 04:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
they've given us a time frame of seven
 
04:58:12.170 --> 04:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
to nine years
 
04:58:15.050 --> 04:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
we cannot downsize our house who's going
 
04:58:17.930 --> 04:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
to buy a house that has no water
 
04:58:20.390 --> 04:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
I've told all of my kids to move away
 
04:58:22.610 --> 04:58:22.620 align:start position:0%
from Merrimack
 
04:58:25.070 --> 04:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
pfas in our water has cost us a lot of
 
04:58:28.490 --> 04:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
money aggravation and heartache and now
 
04:58:31.250 --> 04:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
there appears to be no end in sight as
 
04:58:33.470 --> 04:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
it continues to this day
 
04:58:38.090 --> 04:58:38.100 align:start position:0%
we can't stop it we are getting no help
 
04:58:41.448 --> 04:58:41.458 align:start position:0%
so listen to the proposed changes to
 
04:58:44.208 --> 04:58:44.218 align:start position:0%
this bill we have a chance to get this
 
04:58:46.970 --> 04:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
right and protect peoples and animals
 
04:58:50.090 --> 04:58:50.100 align:start position:0%
Health this is literally a matter of
 
04:58:51.708 --> 04:58:51.718 align:start position:0%
life and death
 
04:58:55.070 --> 04:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
because once this pfest once this pfas
 
04:58:57.890 --> 04:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
toothpaste is out of the tube we're
 
04:59:00.530 --> 04:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
never going to put it back in
 
04:59:05.390 --> 04:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:07.490 --> 04:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any questions from the
 
04:59:07.500 --> 04:59:08.628 align:start position:0%

comments to the committee on SB 61 my
 
04:59:47.868 --> 04:59:47.878 align:start position:0%
testimonial argue in favor passage of
 
04:59:50.570 --> 04:59:50.580 align:start position:0%
the bill my name is Bob Grillo I'm a

05:00:01.730 --> 05:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
continuously since 1986 starting with
 
05:00:03.170 --> 05:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
the first double-line landfill in the
 
05:00:04.910 --> 05:00:04.920 align:start position:0%

engineer and geologist in New Hampshire
 
05:00:09.470 --> 05:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
so with this background I offer the
 
05:00:11.390 --> 05:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
following comments some of this has been
 
05:00:13.970 --> 05:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
covered earlier in great detail so I
 
05:00:16.990 --> 05:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
will make this brief
 
05:00:19.250 --> 05:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
sb61 has Provisions for hiring
 
05:00:20.868 --> 05:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
consultant to assess
 
05:00:23.690 --> 05:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
the landfill the landfill surface to
 
05:00:25.190 --> 05:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
water setback rules and Supply
 
05:00:26.628 --> 05:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
recommendations for any needed
 
05:00:28.970 --> 05:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
enhancement of these setback rules the
 
05:00:30.470 --> 05:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
consultant solicitation should require
 
05:00:32.330 --> 05:00:32.340 align:start position:0%
interested firms to be qualified in a
 
05:00:34.368 --> 05:00:34.378 align:start position:0%
broad range of fields those including
 
05:00:36.128 --> 05:00:36.138 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste engineering hydrogeology
 
05:00:38.330 --> 05:00:38.340 align:start position:0%
environmental assessment radiation and

risk management
 
05:00:43.190 --> 05:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
regarding the conflicts of interest I I
 
05:00:45.410 --> 05:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
support what the director and his
 
05:00:47.208 --> 05:00:47.218 align:start position:0%
assistant said on that and I'm confident
 
05:00:49.970 --> 05:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
that they can make a selection that'll
 
05:00:52.730 --> 05:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
satisfy everyone's concerns there
 
05:00:52.740 --> 05:00:53.750 align:start position:0%
satisfy everyone's concerns there
um

05:00:53.750 --> 05:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:56.690 --> 05:00:56.700 align:start position:0%
also as stated by the director sb61
 
05:00:58.610 --> 05:00:58.620 align:start position:0%
requires public involvement in the
 
05:01:00.470 --> 05:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
solicitation of the consultant as well
 
05:01:02.030 --> 05:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
as in the rulemaking that would follow
 
05:01:03.530 --> 05:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
the completion of the consultant's work
 
05:01:06.050 --> 05:01:06.060 align:start position:0%
this public transparent process should
 
05:01:08.090 --> 05:01:08.100 align:start position:0%
strengthen the resulting rules and the
 
05:01:11.690 --> 05:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
public confidence in them SB 61 supports
 
05:01:14.390 --> 05:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
and enhances the nhges rulemaking
 
05:01:16.730 --> 05:01:16.740 align:start position:0%
process one that includes The Regulators
 
05:01:18.170 --> 05:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
the public and business and
 
05:01:20.750 --> 05:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
environmental stakeholders SB 61
 
05:01:23.448 --> 05:01:23.458 align:start position:0%
significantly improves in my opinion the
 
05:01:25.250 --> 05:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
earlier legislation that prescribed
 
05:01:27.230 --> 05:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
simplified and unscientific methods in
 
05:01:28.910 --> 05:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
the bill itself and affects
 
05:01:30.708 --> 05:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
short-circuiting this rulemaking process
 
05:01:33.350 --> 05:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
which I think is important Uh current
 
05:01:34.850 --> 05:01:34.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Solid Waste rules require
 
05:01:36.830 --> 05:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
landfills to be built with a secondary
 
05:01:38.628 --> 05:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
liner and leaked leachate detection
 
05:01:41.208 --> 05:01:41.218 align:start position:0%
system below the primary liner
 
05:01:41.218 --> 05:01:43.128 align:start position:0%
system below the primary liner
um

05:01:43.128 --> 05:01:43.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
so so this system supplies a redundant
 
05:01:47.390 --> 05:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
barrier to flow and the flow and leakage
 
05:01:49.430 --> 05:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
and leachate collection and provides a
 
05:01:50.990 --> 05:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
means to continuously check the
 
05:01:52.970 --> 05:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
performance of the primary liner if it's
 
05:01:54.650 --> 05:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
leaking it'll show up and it's measured
 
05:01:56.750 --> 05:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
daily so the existing New Hampshire
 
05:01:58.970 --> 05:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
regulatory program of robust groundwater
 
05:02:00.890 --> 05:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
monitoring combined with near continuous
 
05:02:02.090 --> 05:02:02.100 align:start position:0%
monitoring of the primary line
 
05:02:04.190 --> 05:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
containment system has performed
 
05:02:06.670 --> 05:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
exceedingly well over the last 36 years
 
05:02:08.868 --> 05:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of one double Line
 
05:02:10.430 --> 05:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
Landfill that has leaked and needed
 
05:02:12.170 --> 05:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
groundwater remediation over this entire
 
05:02:14.448 --> 05:02:14.458 align:start position:0%
36-year period when these landfills have
 
05:02:16.550 --> 05:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
been in service in the state with that
 
05:02:18.288 --> 05:02:18.298 align:start position:0%
said I understand there's still concerns
 
05:02:20.650 --> 05:02:20.660 align:start position:0%
and there's still risk possibly
 
05:02:23.868 --> 05:02:23.878 align:start position:0%
sp-61 contemplates nhdes considering
 
05:02:25.850 --> 05:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
added measures or engineering controls
 
05:02:27.770 --> 05:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
to enhance these protections and add
 
05:02:29.390 --> 05:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
redundancy to the landfill containment
 
05:02:31.550 --> 05:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
systems these measures should address
 
05:02:33.350 --> 05:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
real or perceived risk on a
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
site-specific basis and a support
 
05:02:37.430 --> 05:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
acceptance of the you know and
 
05:02:39.590 --> 05:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
acceptance of any reduced travel times
 
05:02:41.990 --> 05:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
as a result I support these provisions
 
05:02:44.990 --> 05:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
of SB 61. thank you for your
 
05:02:45.000 --> 05:02:46.430 align:start position:0%
of SB 61. thank you for your
consideration

05:02:46.430 --> 05:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
05:02:49.368 --> 05:02:49.378 align:start position:0%
and uh Mr Grillo would you be able to
 
05:02:51.890 --> 05:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
submit your testimony uh written
 
05:02:54.948 --> 05:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
testimony yes um I have 10 copies I
 
05:02:56.750 --> 05:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
understand you need more yeah just for
 
05:02:58.670 --> 05:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
the clerk did you send it to us by email
 
05:03:00.590 --> 05:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
as well yes you all got it by email okay
 
05:03:05.750 --> 05:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
any questions for Mr Grillo oh I'm sorry
 
05:03:10.910 --> 05:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Murray
 
05:03:12.708 --> 05:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
yep yeah
 
05:03:14.330 --> 05:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr Grillo for taking my
 
05:03:15.948 --> 05:03:15.958 align:start position:0%
question so I did just want to speak
 
05:03:18.288 --> 05:03:18.298 align:start position:0%
really quickly about double liner
 
05:03:21.410 --> 05:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
systems and if you could clarify
 
05:03:23.810 --> 05:03:23.820 align:start position:0%
um they are not always
 
05:03:26.570 --> 05:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
plastic double liners correct sometimes
 
05:03:28.910 --> 05:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
it is one-liners plastic and one liner
 
05:03:31.368 --> 05:03:31.378 align:start position:0%
maybe clay in New Hampshire the rules
 
05:03:33.890 --> 05:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
require two plastic liners and there is
 
05:03:35.750 --> 05:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
a soil component beneath the lower one
 
05:03:35.760 --> 05:03:38.390 align:start position:0%
a soil component beneath the lower one
yes

05:03:38.390 --> 05:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:40.190 --> 05:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:03:42.770 --> 05:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
committee representative Haskins thank
 
05:03:45.530 --> 05:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
you madam chair Mr Grillo are you aware
 
05:03:49.250 --> 05:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
of double liners leaking yes
 
05:03:52.730 --> 05:03:52.740 align:start position:0%
so you know at times we hear a double
 
05:03:55.788 --> 05:03:55.798 align:start position:0%
liner is state of the art do you think
 
05:03:58.910 --> 05:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's state of the art I I do and and if
 
05:04:01.368 --> 05:04:01.378 align:start position:0%
I could explain in just a minute
 
05:04:03.430 --> 05:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
um so you have a lining system on top
 
05:04:07.010 --> 05:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
and you you measure any liquid that gets
 
05:04:08.868 --> 05:04:08.878 align:start position:0%
through that lining system to the second
 
05:04:11.448 --> 05:04:11.458 align:start position:0%
liner it's usually a very small amount
 
05:04:13.850 --> 05:04:13.860 align:start position:0%
most of the time it's clean water that
 
05:04:15.110 --> 05:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
gets in from the edges but nonetheless
 
05:04:17.410 --> 05:04:17.420 align:start position:0%
there is a little bit of water there
 
05:04:19.250 --> 05:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
then you have the second system
 
05:04:20.750 --> 05:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
underneath it which has to deal with
 
05:04:22.128 --> 05:04:22.138 align:start position:0%
much much less water and you can
 
05:04:24.050 --> 05:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
actually calculate based on what kind of
 
05:04:26.810 --> 05:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
holes you had in the first liner what is
 
05:04:29.208 --> 05:04:29.218 align:start position:0%
in the second liner calculate what goes
 
05:04:31.368 --> 05:04:31.378 align:start position:0%
through and it's such a small amount yes
 
05:04:33.590 --> 05:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
I mean no one's perfect no materials are
 
05:04:35.990 --> 05:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
perfect this thing was made by man but
 
05:04:37.550 --> 05:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
the amount of leakage is so small
 
05:04:39.650 --> 05:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
through that second liner that is
 
05:04:41.510 --> 05:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
immeasurable and that's been the case
 
05:04:43.250 --> 05:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
over these last 30 something years that
 
05:04:45.470 --> 05:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
the monitoring Wheels do not pick up any
 
05:04:47.570 --> 05:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
of the contamination from the landfill
 
05:04:49.310 --> 05:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
in the groundwater
 
05:04:51.110 --> 05:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:04:53.570 --> 05:04:53.580 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
05:04:56.510 --> 05:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none I would call Representative
 
05:04:58.250 --> 05:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
Walter Stapleton
 
05:05:05.448 --> 05:05:05.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:05.458 --> 05:05:09.470 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:05:09.470 --> 05:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:12.890 --> 05:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is representative
 
05:05:14.810 --> 05:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
Walt Stapleton
 
05:05:17.448 --> 05:05:17.458 align:start position:0%
from Sullivan County District Six the
 
05:05:21.230 --> 05:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
towns of Claremont and Croydon
 
05:05:25.610 --> 05:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
I'm here in support of SB 61 but with
 
05:05:29.690 --> 05:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:32.830 --> 05:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
we've come a long way from
 
05:05:37.390 --> 05:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
1454 and almost got there with
 
05:05:41.990 --> 05:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
56. I was quite in favor of
 
05:05:46.510 --> 05:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
The Five-Year time in travel formula
 
05:05:49.070 --> 05:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
but of course that was telling the
 
05:05:51.770 --> 05:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
professionals what specific method to
 
05:05:51.780 --> 05:05:53.030 align:start position:0%
professionals what specific method to
use

05:05:53.030 --> 05:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
use
 
05:05:57.410 --> 05:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
in current and developing science
 
05:06:00.890 --> 05:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
so while I was disappointed we don't see
 
05:06:02.990 --> 05:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
the time and travel within
 
05:06:06.050 --> 05:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
this bill the reference to other states
 
05:06:10.010 --> 05:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
use current technology and science
 
05:06:12.530 --> 05:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
we've turned the rock over and it should
 
05:06:15.288 --> 05:06:15.298 align:start position:0%
be evident what's out there from the
 
05:06:18.948 --> 05:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
Department's ability to investigate
 
05:06:22.310 --> 05:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy that with all the efforts
 
05:06:25.430 --> 05:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
over these couple of terms here
 
05:06:29.448 --> 05:06:29.458 align:start position:0%
that the antique Antiquated method of
 
05:06:29.458 --> 05:06:31.070 align:start position:0%
that the antique Antiquated method of
200

05:06:31.070 --> 05:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
200
 
05:06:34.010 --> 05:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
feet distance is uh
 
05:06:37.010 --> 05:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
recognizes tantamount to driving a Model
 
05:06:40.010 --> 05:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
T down I-93
 
05:06:43.190 --> 05:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
we don't want to be doing that anymore
 
05:06:45.110 --> 05:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
the problems
 
05:06:47.030 --> 05:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
that I see
 
05:06:47.040 --> 05:06:48.530 align:start position:0%
that I see
um

05:06:48.530 --> 05:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:50.448 --> 05:06:50.458 align:start position:0%
three of them
 
05:06:52.850 --> 05:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
there's no mention of
 
05:06:57.288 --> 05:06:57.298 align:start position:0%
landfill sites over or near aquifers as
 
05:07:02.030 --> 05:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
there was in the amendment to HB 56.
 
05:07:04.128 --> 05:07:04.138 align:start position:0%
well maybe we have to address that at
 
05:07:06.410 --> 05:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
some other point or if there's going to
 
05:07:07.850 --> 05:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
be an amendment
 
05:07:10.750 --> 05:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps we might include mention of that
 
05:07:13.070 --> 05:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
as a
 
05:07:16.190 --> 05:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
criteria to look at as well as the surf
 
05:07:19.010 --> 05:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
perennial surface waters
 
05:07:21.350 --> 05:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
the second item
 
05:07:24.550 --> 05:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
the bill is absent conflicts of interest
 
05:07:28.610 --> 05:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
with regard to site geology assessment
 
05:07:28.620 --> 05:07:30.490 align:start position:0%
with regard to site geology assessment
contractors

05:07:30.490 --> 05:07:30.500 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
05:07:33.708 --> 05:07:33.718 align:start position:0%
but I'm satisfied that what the
 
05:07:36.410 --> 05:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
department has said relative to
 
05:07:39.410 --> 05:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
including that within the RFP and
 
05:07:41.570 --> 05:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
working with the AG
 
05:07:41.580 --> 05:07:43.850 align:start position:0%
working with the AG
Ates

05:07:43.850 --> 05:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
Ates
 
05:07:46.970 --> 05:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
a sensitivity to that concern
 
05:07:48.830 --> 05:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
but at least if there's going to be an
 
05:07:52.250 --> 05:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
amendment perhaps just a mention that
 
05:07:52.260 --> 05:07:54.128 align:start position:0%
amendment perhaps just a mention that
adequate

05:07:54.128 --> 05:07:54.138 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
05:07:56.990 --> 05:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest concerns would be
 
05:07:57.000 --> 05:07:59.510 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest concerns would be
addressed

05:07:59.510 --> 05:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
05:08:03.050 --> 05:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
but the Big Kahuna is the page five
 
05:08:05.030 --> 05:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
Roman 3
 
05:08:07.670 --> 05:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
if the department does not adopt new
 
05:08:10.128 --> 05:08:10.138 align:start position:0%
rules within 24 months
 
05:08:13.128 --> 05:08:13.138 align:start position:0%
of the effective date of this act
 
05:08:15.050 --> 05:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
etc etc
 
05:08:17.750 --> 05:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
we go back to square one
 
05:08:20.750 --> 05:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
and the Model T on I-93
 
05:08:23.570 --> 05:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
and we can't be doing that
 
05:08:26.810 --> 05:08:26.820 align:start position:0%
my concerns are with some of the outline
 
05:08:28.670 --> 05:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
process of times
 
05:08:30.650 --> 05:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
of which there are quite a few in there
 
05:08:32.990 --> 05:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
30 days of the ACT
 
05:08:36.230 --> 05:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
to post the RFP draft
 
05:08:40.070 --> 05:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
30 days after that for public comment
 
05:08:46.070 --> 05:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:46.080 --> 05:08:47.868 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:08:47.868 --> 05:08:47.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:54.590 --> 05:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:57.708 --> 05:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
there's something missing in here
 
05:09:01.128 --> 05:09:01.138 align:start position:0%
the bill is missing an award date or at
 
05:09:03.050 --> 05:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
least the number of days
 
05:09:05.930 --> 05:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
after submission deadline
 
05:09:09.350 --> 05:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
for the Department to respond
 
05:09:11.930 --> 05:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
so that there's no so that there's a
 
05:09:15.830 --> 05:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
check against erosion of time available
 
05:09:17.930 --> 05:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
for the Department to adopt and
 
05:09:17.940 --> 05:09:19.670 align:start position:0%
for the Department to adopt and
incorporate

05:09:19.670 --> 05:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
incorporate
 
05:09:23.708 --> 05:09:23.718 align:start position:0%
the little rules in time to avoid that
 
05:09:28.250 --> 05:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
reversion to existing standards
 
05:09:31.010 --> 05:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
again missing the award date or a number
 
05:09:35.090 --> 05:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
of days in that linear process to make
 
05:09:36.530 --> 05:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
the award
 
05:09:39.470 --> 05:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
serious erosion of time could occur for
 
05:09:44.170 --> 05:09:44.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:47.150 --> 05:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
essentially a slow process for staff
 
05:09:51.190 --> 05:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
problems other emergencies whatever
 
05:09:54.288 --> 05:09:54.298 align:start position:0%
could be an unfortunate Escape escape
 
05:09:54.298 --> 05:09:56.090 align:start position:0%
could be an unfortunate Escape escape
hatch

05:09:56.090 --> 05:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
hatch
 
05:09:58.550 --> 05:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
for missing this opportunity
 
05:10:03.470 --> 05:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:05.330 --> 05:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
so instead there should
 
05:10:08.628 --> 05:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
really be at Roman 3 a mandate to
 
05:10:10.670 --> 05:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
complete the work
 
05:10:12.708 --> 05:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
even with the delay and that would
 
05:10:12.718 --> 05:10:14.448 align:start position:0%
even with the delay and that would
comprehend

05:10:14.448 --> 05:10:14.458 align:start position:0%
comprehend
 
05:10:17.208 --> 05:10:17.218 align:start position:0%
extension provisions
 
05:10:20.750 --> 05:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
like six months for apps in process to
 
05:10:23.208 --> 05:10:23.218 align:start position:0%
be held in advance for unforeseen
 
05:10:27.170 --> 05:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:27.180 --> 05:10:27.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:10:27.890 --> 05:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:29.510 --> 05:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
we can't just
 
05:10:31.788 --> 05:10:31.798 align:start position:0%
dump it off the cliff
 
05:10:34.610 --> 05:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what Romans Section 3
 
05:10:34.620 --> 05:10:36.288 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what Romans Section 3
does

05:10:36.288 --> 05:10:36.298 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:10:40.070 --> 05:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
and hopefully that would be the most
 
05:10:42.410 --> 05:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
important item included in an amendment
 
05:10:44.690 --> 05:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
which I hope the committee will
 
05:10:48.350 --> 05:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
incorporate into this very fine bill
 
05:10:50.750 --> 05:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
which otherwise is very comprehensive
 
05:10:52.910 --> 05:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
satisfactory well thought well
 
05:10:52.920 --> 05:10:54.288 align:start position:0%
satisfactory well thought well
constructed

05:10:54.288 --> 05:10:54.298 align:start position:0%
constructed
 
05:10:57.230 --> 05:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
but we have to plug the holes
 
05:11:01.128 --> 05:11:01.138 align:start position:0%
and that concludes my opinion on this
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative Stapleton thank you do
 
05:11:06.050 --> 05:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
you have written testimony to him to the
 
05:11:08.510 --> 05:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
clerk no I don't that's just rough notes
 
05:11:10.310 --> 05:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head okay thank you
 
05:11:10.320 --> 05:11:11.810 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head okay thank you
okay

05:11:11.810 --> 05:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:11:13.610 --> 05:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative
 
05:11:13.620 --> 05:11:15.470 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative
Stapleton

05:11:15.470 --> 05:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
Stapleton
 
05:11:19.310 --> 05:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
nope seeing none no no no okay seeing
 
05:11:22.010 --> 05:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
none thank you and I now call Wayne
 
05:11:22.020 --> 05:11:23.448 align:start position:0%
none thank you and I now call Wayne
Morrison

05:11:23.448 --> 05:11:23.458 align:start position:0%
Morrison
 
05:11:50.570 --> 05:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:52.490 --> 05:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon to
 
05:11:54.770 --> 05:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture
 
05:11:57.230 --> 05:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:11:57.240 --> 05:11:58.250 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:11:58.250 --> 05:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:00.410 --> 05:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
let me start by saying I heard a lot of
 
05:12:02.150 --> 05:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
interesting things I heard I heard some
 
05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
very good things I just start by going
 
05:12:07.310 --> 05:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
back to what Senator Waters said that
 
05:12:09.890 --> 05:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
there is a growing desire to get
 
05:12:13.788 --> 05:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:15.650 --> 05:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
um I want to amplify that a thousand
 
05:12:19.250 --> 05:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
percent we need to get something done
 
05:12:21.050 --> 05:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Wayne
 
05:12:23.390 --> 05:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
Morrison and I am president of a
 
05:12:25.128 --> 05:12:25.138 align:start position:0%
Grassroots organization called North
 
05:12:28.550 --> 05:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
Country Alliance for balance change
 
05:12:30.230 --> 05:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
we have been in front of this committee
 
05:12:32.390 --> 05:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
and and the your counterparts in the
 
05:12:33.970 --> 05:12:33.980 align:start position:0%
Senate over the last four or five years
 
05:12:37.550 --> 05:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
bringing house bills 177.
 
05:12:42.708 --> 05:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 1454 house bill 56.
 
05:12:44.208 --> 05:12:44.218 align:start position:0%
I want you to know I've spent the first
 
05:12:46.190 --> 05:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
six years of my retirement working on
 
05:12:47.690 --> 05:12:47.700 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste something that I never
 
05:12:49.190 --> 05:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
thought in a million years I would be
 
05:12:49.200 --> 05:12:51.830 align:start position:0%
thought in a million years I would be
doing

05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:54.170 --> 05:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
I want to support
 
05:12:57.170 --> 05:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:01.430 --> 05:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:03.288 --> 05:13:03.298 align:start position:0%
I think the concepts in this
 
05:13:06.350 --> 05:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
legislations are ones we can agree with
 
05:13:08.510 --> 05:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
at least in principle
 
05:13:08.520 --> 05:13:10.010 align:start position:0%
at least in principle
however

05:13:10.010 --> 05:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:13:12.230 --> 05:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
in good faith and after working these
 
05:13:16.070 --> 05:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
issues for a good length of time
 
05:13:17.868 --> 05:13:17.878 align:start position:0%
there are some things in this bill that
 
05:13:19.910 --> 05:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
I think and we have been discussing but
 
05:13:22.730 --> 05:13:22.740 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed
 
05:13:26.330 --> 05:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
the intentions of the stakeholders you
 
05:13:28.070 --> 05:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
know there are a lot of stakeholders in
 
05:13:28.080 --> 05:13:29.090 align:start position:0%
know there are a lot of stakeholders in
this

05:13:29.090 --> 05:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:13:31.368 --> 05:13:31.378 align:start position:0%
I don't understand how it could possibly
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
be that by somehow improving this bill
 
05:13:37.970 --> 05:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
that it would get destroyed
 
05:13:39.650 --> 05:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
I don't know what's in the governor's
 
05:13:42.350 --> 05:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
head I don't know why he chose to veto
 
05:13:45.350 --> 05:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1454 it was good legislation
 
05:13:48.230 --> 05:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
and so is House Bill 56 but we are where
 
05:13:50.510 --> 05:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
we are and the question is what are we
 
05:13:54.650 --> 05:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:59.090 --> 05:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
We Have Heard on multiple occasions from
 
05:14:01.250 --> 05:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
from Des
 
05:14:04.368 --> 05:14:04.378 align:start position:0%
through their testimony that they need
 
05:14:06.230 --> 05:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
additional technical knowledge to feel
 
05:14:08.570 --> 05:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
comfortable in making a change to the
 
05:14:12.770 --> 05:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:15.590 --> 05:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
I think we should give Des whatever they
 
05:14:15.600 --> 05:14:16.550 align:start position:0%
I think we should give Des whatever they
need

05:14:16.550 --> 05:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
need
 
05:14:19.490 --> 05:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
to reach a good conclusion and change a
 
05:14:20.890 --> 05:14:20.900 align:start position:0%
32 year old
 
05:14:23.410 --> 05:14:23.420 align:start position:0%
inadequate unsafe
 
05:14:25.788 --> 05:14:25.798 align:start position:0%
unhelpful dangerous
 
05:14:28.730 --> 05:14:28.740 align:start position:0%
200 foot setback that not only doesn't
 
05:14:30.410 --> 05:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
make sense to me but I think if you
 
05:14:32.750 --> 05:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
lined up 95 percent of the population of
 
05:14:35.628 --> 05:14:35.638 align:start position:0%
this state and you said 200 feet is
 
05:14:37.368 --> 05:14:37.378 align:start position:0%
barely out the door do you think that's
 
05:14:41.150 --> 05:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
enough space between a lake a river of
 
05:14:44.270 --> 05:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
the Atlantic Ocean and a landfill
 
05:14:46.670 --> 05:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
I think you'd get a resounding
 
05:14:50.930 --> 05:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
no way that's insane we need to fix it
 
05:14:53.750 --> 05:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
I am I spent my career in technology I
 
05:14:55.550 --> 05:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
believe in technology I'm a business
 
05:14:57.708 --> 05:14:57.718 align:start position:0%
person my life has been enriched by
 
05:15:01.128 --> 05:15:01.138 align:start position:0%
working for corporations I am by no
 
05:15:03.708 --> 05:15:03.718 align:start position:0%
means against business
 
05:15:05.510 --> 05:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
but I live in New Hampshire because
 
05:15:09.288 --> 05:15:09.298 align:start position:0%
clean air clean water Open Spaces I love
 
05:15:11.208 --> 05:15:11.218 align:start position:0%
this state
 
05:15:14.570 --> 05:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
as it turns out my family owns property
 
05:15:17.270 --> 05:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
on Forest Lake in Whitefield New
 
05:15:17.280 --> 05:15:18.890 align:start position:0%
on Forest Lake in Whitefield New
Hampshire

05:15:18.890 --> 05:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:15:22.850 --> 05:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
I have I wish Casella no ill will but
 
05:15:25.128 --> 05:15:25.138 align:start position:0%
they have picked a terrible sight
 
05:15:28.850 --> 05:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
to plan a mega landfill near the amnusic
 
05:15:32.270 --> 05:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
River Forest Lake Forest Lake State Park
 
05:15:34.970 --> 05:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
and a recreation area
 
05:15:37.310 --> 05:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
all the technology in the world is great
 
05:15:40.310 --> 05:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
but you as a legislative body as you
 
05:15:42.410 --> 05:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
think about policy you should assume
 
05:15:45.230 --> 05:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
that things are going to fail
 
05:15:48.288 --> 05:15:48.298 align:start position:0%
you should assume double liners triple
 
05:15:51.470 --> 05:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
liners quadruple liners monitoring Wells
 
05:15:54.170 --> 05:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
all of that stuff we should do all of it
 
05:15:57.170 --> 05:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
but the point of a setback is when the
 
05:15:58.970 --> 05:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
 hits the fan and something goes
 
05:16:01.010 --> 05:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
wrong that we have enough time to
 
05:16:03.288 --> 05:16:03.298 align:start position:0%
intercept it before a river gets
 
05:16:05.810 --> 05:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
polluted and before drinking water gets
 
05:16:08.270 --> 05:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
polluted and there's no remediation for
 
05:16:10.910 --> 05:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
that you heard from Wendy Thomas
 
05:16:15.230 --> 05:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
the awful story that she had to tell you
 
05:16:17.390 --> 05:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why it's taken this
 
05:16:20.330 --> 05:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
long this is one slice one small piece
 
05:16:22.430 --> 05:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
of a complicated
 
05:16:25.070 --> 05:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
system of solid waste in the state that
 
05:16:27.230 --> 05:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed we have a lot of
 
05:16:29.810 --> 05:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
issues to deal with I have great respect
 
05:16:33.110 --> 05:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
for Des they have a very difficult job
 
05:16:35.150 --> 05:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
but as a member of the public as
 
05:16:38.270 --> 05:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
somebody that has been fighting
 
05:16:40.670 --> 05:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
to make solid waste reform and change
 
05:16:43.490 --> 05:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
I'm appalled that it's five years into
 
05:16:45.948 --> 05:16:45.958 align:start position:0%
the process and we are still now it's
 
05:16:47.690 --> 05:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
going to be two more
 
05:16:50.510 --> 05:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
if we if we pass this bill
 
05:16:53.510 --> 05:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm telling you we don't need this
 
05:16:55.850 --> 05:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
is not rocket science
 
05:16:57.830 --> 05:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
yes we should we should go off and we
 
05:17:00.170 --> 05:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
should get I'm all in favor of of a lot
 
05:17:01.730 --> 05:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
of this bill we should go off and get
 
05:17:03.530 --> 05:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
the best Minds we should Benchmark what
 
05:17:05.150 --> 05:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
the best states are doing
 
05:17:07.490 --> 05:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
but we got to get moving
 
05:17:09.410 --> 05:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
all I ask from you as you as you
 
05:17:12.110 --> 05:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
contemplate this bill
 
05:17:14.510 --> 05:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
I think you should think about conflict
 
05:17:16.250 --> 05:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
of interest in this business is is a
 
05:17:18.050 --> 05:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
real issue New Hampshire is a small
 
05:17:18.060 --> 05:17:19.128 align:start position:0%
real issue New Hampshire is a small
state

05:17:19.128 --> 05:17:19.138 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:17:22.010 --> 05:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
my little Grassroots organization went
 
05:17:24.230 --> 05:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
off to try and hire a solid waste
 
05:17:24.240 --> 05:17:25.250 align:start position:0%
off to try and hire a solid waste
engineer

05:17:25.250 --> 05:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
engineer
 
05:17:27.050 --> 05:17:27.060 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you
 
05:17:29.390 --> 05:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
months into the process every one of
 
05:17:33.170 --> 05:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
those people is tied to the solid waste
 
05:17:34.910 --> 05:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
industry in this state they have
 
05:17:36.890 --> 05:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest
 
05:17:40.250 --> 05:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
we need to find competent people
 
05:17:42.770 --> 05:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
but that is not an easy task and I want
 
05:17:44.690 --> 05:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
to believe in this process I don't think
 
05:17:46.610 --> 05:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
anyone's going into this process not
 
05:17:49.070 --> 05:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
trying to do the right thing but
 
05:17:51.050 --> 05:17:51.060 align:start position:0%
it is very important that we find
 
05:17:52.910 --> 05:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
somebody that's independent that is
 
05:17:54.708 --> 05:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
going to actually give us the kind of
 
05:17:57.350 --> 05:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
data and the whatever that report tends
 
05:17:59.510 --> 05:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
ends up being
 
05:18:01.730 --> 05:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
we want that to be real stuff we don't
 
05:18:04.010 --> 05:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
want window dressing we want real action
 
05:18:06.890 --> 05:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
if we're going to spend 150 000 in this
 
05:18:09.230 --> 05:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
state we want to spend it wisely we want
 
05:18:10.610 --> 05:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
to get our money's worth and we want to
 
05:18:12.530 --> 05:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
get on with a real action here to get
 
05:18:17.150 --> 05:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:20.690 --> 05:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:22.730 --> 05:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
I would also I would also remind the
 
05:18:22.740 --> 05:18:23.930 align:start position:0%
I would also I would also remind the
committee

05:18:23.930 --> 05:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:18:25.550 --> 05:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
that there's a couple of things that are
 
05:18:26.868 --> 05:18:26.878 align:start position:0%
just true
 
05:18:29.090 --> 05:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
there are currently no applications for
 
05:18:30.770 --> 05:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
a new landfill development in front of
 
05:18:30.780 --> 05:18:32.030 align:start position:0%
a new landfill development in front of
Des

05:18:32.030 --> 05:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
Des
 
05:18:34.190 --> 05:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
and any applicant that does come forward
 
05:18:36.708 --> 05:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
knows what the what's been transpiring
 
05:18:38.510 --> 05:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
for the last five years and that there's
 
05:18:40.670 --> 05:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
changes coming in this and the the
 
05:18:43.490 --> 05:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
regulations are going to change
 
05:18:46.368 --> 05:18:46.378 align:start position:0%
I'm sympathetic to business and I want
 
05:18:48.050 --> 05:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
us to do the right thing
 
05:18:50.990 --> 05:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
but I am even equally sympathetic to the
 
05:18:53.868 --> 05:18:53.878 align:start position:0%
public who is asking for environmental
 
05:18:56.390 --> 05:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
health and safety protection
 
05:19:00.650 --> 05:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
every day I read about toxic stuff
 
05:19:04.010 --> 05:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
that's in landfills in that leachate
 
05:19:06.530 --> 05:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
and if you aren't discomforted by the
 
05:19:09.288 --> 05:19:09.298 align:start position:0%
fact that the 200-foot set book 30 years
 
05:19:11.390 --> 05:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
ago we didn't know well today we know a
 
05:19:13.250 --> 05:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
lot more and we know it is more and more
 
05:19:14.930 --> 05:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
and more dangerous
 
05:19:16.670 --> 05:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
the second thing I would ask you to
 
05:19:16.680 --> 05:19:18.530 align:start position:0%
the second thing I would ask you to
contemplate

05:19:18.530 --> 05:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
contemplate
 
05:19:20.570 --> 05:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
is that the Department of Environmental
 
05:19:23.030 --> 05:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
Services published a biennial report
 
05:19:24.708 --> 05:19:24.718 align:start position:0%
back in November
 
05:19:27.170 --> 05:19:27.180 align:start position:0%
and in it it says we don't have any
 
05:19:29.448 --> 05:19:29.458 align:start position:0%
capacity issue
 
05:19:32.510 --> 05:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
we don't need a new landfill tomorrow
 
05:19:35.510 --> 05:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
we may need one 10 years from now
 
05:19:38.150 --> 05:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
I question if we even need it then but
 
05:19:40.610 --> 05:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of time to get this right
 
05:19:42.770 --> 05:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to invest if we're
 
05:19:44.510 --> 05:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
going to if we're going to allow if
 
05:19:46.128 --> 05:19:46.138 align:start position:0%
we're going to permit another landfill
 
05:19:48.650 --> 05:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
that's going to last a hundred years or
 
05:19:50.690 --> 05:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
200 years
 
05:19:53.510 --> 05:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
please don't let a month or two get in
 
05:19:55.788 --> 05:19:55.798 align:start position:0%
the way of doing the right thing on this
 
05:19:55.798 --> 05:19:56.810 align:start position:0%
the way of doing the right thing on this
bill

05:19:56.810 --> 05:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:19:59.570 --> 05:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
the people of this state deserve
 
05:20:01.550 --> 05:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
much better than what we've been living
 
05:20:01.560 --> 05:20:02.510 align:start position:0%
much better than what we've been living
with

05:20:02.510 --> 05:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:20:04.550 --> 05:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
and I believe
 
05:20:06.530 --> 05:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
that we are fortunate
 
05:20:09.050 --> 05:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
that our health and safety and the leaks
 
05:20:10.730 --> 05:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
and the problems that we hear all over
 
05:20:13.128 --> 05:20:13.138 align:start position:0%
the country in some of these places we
 
05:20:14.868 --> 05:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
are not better off because of our
 
05:20:17.810 --> 05:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
regulation we we are better off in spite
 
05:20:19.430 --> 05:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
of our regulation I think we've been
 
05:20:19.440 --> 05:20:20.628 align:start position:0%
of our regulation I think we've been
lucky

05:20:20.628 --> 05:20:20.638 align:start position:0%
lucky
 
05:20:23.090 --> 05:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
don't let a disaster happen when you
 
05:20:24.590 --> 05:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
know that it we can do better than this
 
05:20:26.570 --> 05:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire deserve more
 
05:20:28.310 --> 05:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
than what we're giving them and the time
 
05:20:30.890 --> 05:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
to act is now and I don't know what the
 
05:20:32.448 --> 05:20:32.458 align:start position:0%
governor is going to do
 
05:20:34.850 --> 05:20:34.860 align:start position:0%
but you should do the right thing and as
 
05:20:37.310 --> 05:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
you did with 1454 if the governor makes
 
05:20:39.110 --> 05:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
the wrong decision you have the power to
 
05:20:40.910 --> 05:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
override it
 
05:20:42.890 --> 05:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
so I ask you to stand up and do the
 
05:20:44.030 --> 05:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
right thing for the people of New
 
05:20:47.270 --> 05:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:49.190 --> 05:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
05:20:50.868 --> 05:20:50.878 align:start position:0%
from the committee nope
 
05:20:53.390 --> 05:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:21:02.090 --> 05:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:05.628 --> 05:21:05.638 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to get on we we are you know
 
05:21:08.510 --> 05:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
going when we've got a lot of pink cards
 
05:21:08.520 --> 05:21:10.730 align:start position:0%
going when we've got a lot of pink cards
here

05:21:10.730 --> 05:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:13.750 --> 05:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
um I would like to call Nora Bosworth to
 
05:21:27.128 --> 05:21:27.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:30.770 --> 05:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
okay it's passing around
 
05:21:33.050 --> 05:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
hello again
 
05:21:35.868 --> 05:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman Aaron and
 
05:21:38.090 --> 05:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members
 
05:21:39.590 --> 05:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear a lot of similar
 
05:21:42.110 --> 05:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
points the ones that were just made but
 
05:21:43.670 --> 05:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
they were good ones
 
05:21:46.070 --> 05:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
I'm the zero way staff attorney for
 
05:21:47.030 --> 05:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
Northern New England for the
 
05:21:50.690 --> 05:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
conservation law foundation and clf
 
05:21:50.700 --> 05:21:52.270 align:start position:0%
conservation law foundation and clf
supports

05:21:52.270 --> 05:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
supports
 
05:21:55.970 --> 05:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
sb61 provided that it is amended in a
 
05:21:59.628 --> 05:21:59.638 align:start position:0%
few important and modest ways
 
05:22:02.150 --> 05:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
we believe that with the Amendments I'm
 
05:22:03.890 --> 05:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
going to speak to this bill could be a
 
05:22:05.510 --> 05:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
huge step forward for the state's
 
05:22:07.910 --> 05:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
protection of its Waters and residents
 
05:22:12.830 --> 05:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:15.350 --> 05:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
and site-specific setbacks are necessary
 
05:22:18.530 --> 05:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
because all landfill liner systems have
 
05:22:20.448 --> 05:22:20.458 align:start position:0%
limited lifespans and can eventually
 
05:22:23.570 --> 05:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
leak some slowly over time and others
 
05:22:25.610 --> 05:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
shortly after installation
 
05:22:28.490 --> 05:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
Des has admitted that landfill liner
 
05:22:30.830 --> 05:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
systems have finite lifespans
 
05:22:32.990 --> 05:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
and waste in conventional subtitle D
 
05:22:35.750 --> 05:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
landfills remain hazardous and otherwise
 
05:22:38.448 --> 05:22:38.458 align:start position:0%
harmful to groundwater quality for as
 
05:22:40.310 --> 05:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
long as they remain buried and leachable
 
05:22:42.890 --> 05:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
components persist which is centuries to
 
05:22:45.350 --> 05:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
Millennia into the future far beyond the
 
05:22:47.868 --> 05:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
36 years that we can look to now
 
05:22:49.970 --> 05:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
so for all these reasons it is essential
 
05:22:51.590 --> 05:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire adopts stronger
 
05:22:53.628 --> 05:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
protections to prevent contamination of
 
05:22:55.788 --> 05:22:55.798 align:start position:0%
surface waters
 
05:22:57.948 --> 05:22:57.958 align:start position:0%
and I just want to add since we've been
 
05:22:59.330 --> 05:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
talking a lot about what we're still
 
05:23:02.448 --> 05:23:02.458 align:start position:0%
discovering uh this year alone the EPA
 
05:23:04.550 --> 05:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
studied 200 landfills across the country
 
05:23:08.330 --> 05:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
and tested the leachate for pfas and
 
05:23:10.850 --> 05:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
found pfas in 95 percent of the leachate
 
05:23:12.650 --> 05:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
of the 200 landfills across the country
 
05:23:16.010 --> 05:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:18.650 --> 05:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
so this legislation would be far more
 
05:23:20.390 --> 05:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
effective if it specified that the
 
05:23:22.550 --> 05:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
contractor hired to assess the setback
 
05:23:25.490 --> 05:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
regulations must be independent and
 
05:23:27.470 --> 05:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
appropriately qualified
 
05:23:29.448 --> 05:23:29.458 align:start position:0%
the independent third party should not
 
05:23:31.850 --> 05:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
be affiliated with any past or current
 
05:23:34.128 --> 05:23:34.138 align:start position:0%
projects on behalf of a current landfill
 
05:23:35.750 --> 05:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
owner or operator
 
05:23:38.090 --> 05:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
nor have a past current or intended
 
05:23:39.770 --> 05:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
future client relationship with any
 
05:23:42.350 --> 05:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
landfill owner or operator this is a
 
05:23:43.910 --> 05:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
basic conflict of interest provision and
 
05:23:45.948 --> 05:23:45.958 align:start position:0%
the language is in there to guide this
 
05:23:45.958 --> 05:23:47.390 align:start position:0%
the language is in there to guide this
amendment

05:23:47.390 --> 05:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:23:49.368 --> 05:23:49.378 align:start position:0%
Additionally the contractor should be a
 
05:23:50.930 --> 05:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
qualified hydrogeologist with
 
05:23:53.330 --> 05:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
demonstrated capability to assess and
 
05:23:54.770 --> 05:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
determine appropriate setback
 
05:23:57.170 --> 05:23:57.180 align:start position:0%
requirements for landfills as well as
 
05:23:58.910 --> 05:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
have significant experience in
 
05:24:03.890 --> 05:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:07.368 --> 05:24:07.378 align:start position:0%
and as many of us have been touching on
 
05:24:09.650 --> 05:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
via bands on new landfill permit
 
05:24:11.628 --> 05:24:11.638 align:start position:0%
applications should last until the new
 
05:24:13.910 --> 05:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
site-specific regulations are adopted
 
05:24:13.920 --> 05:24:15.410 align:start position:0%
site-specific regulations are adopted
period

05:24:15.410 --> 05:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
period
 
05:24:17.750 --> 05:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
the 200-foot setback is an inadequate
 
05:24:19.670 --> 05:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
inadequate protection and thus we are
 
05:24:22.128 --> 05:24:22.138 align:start position:0%
here and this bill requires the adoption
 
05:24:25.250 --> 05:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
of new site-specific regulations and it
 
05:24:27.110 --> 05:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
is irresponsible
 
05:24:29.030 --> 05:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
to allow the issuance of a landfill
 
05:24:30.948 --> 05:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
permit under outdated rules simply
 
05:24:33.050 --> 05:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
because the agency completes their Duty
 
05:24:34.490 --> 05:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
potentially in more months than
 
05:24:34.500 --> 05:24:36.230 align:start position:0%
potentially in more months than
anticipated

05:24:36.230 --> 05:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
anticipated
 
05:24:38.690 --> 05:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
Des is already Limited in their timeline
 
05:24:40.430 --> 05:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
by the months required to hire a
 
05:24:43.190 --> 05:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
contractor and the 150 days allowed for
 
05:24:44.690 --> 05:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
that contractor to finalize the
 
05:24:46.368 --> 05:24:46.378 align:start position:0%
recommendations that Des has to then
 
05:24:48.110 --> 05:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
take into account when they propose new
 
05:24:50.628 --> 05:24:50.638 align:start position:0%
regulations so it's not a full 24 months
 
05:24:52.070 --> 05:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
by any means
 
05:24:54.050 --> 05:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
the events on the granting of new
 
05:24:55.730 --> 05:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
landfill permits should last until the
 
05:24:57.650 --> 05:24:57.660 align:start position:0%
new regulations the better protections
 
05:24:59.690 --> 05:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
are adopted even if such adoption
 
05:25:03.410 --> 05:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:05.390 --> 05:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
the abandons does not work for everyone
 
05:25:07.010 --> 05:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
despite what we've heard it does not
 
05:25:10.270 --> 05:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
work for residents who live near
 
05:25:14.868 --> 05:25:14.878 align:start position:0%
landfills or future landfills and clf
 
05:25:17.448 --> 05:25:17.458 align:start position:0%
urges the committee to amend SB 61 as
 
05:25:19.010 --> 05:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
discussed above
 
05:25:21.890 --> 05:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
and then to vote as amended that it
 
05:25:22.850 --> 05:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
05:25:25.250 --> 05:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your time
 
05:25:28.010 --> 05:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Ms Bosworth any questions from
 
05:25:30.350 --> 05:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:25:34.010 --> 05:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again and oh I'm
 
05:25:35.750 --> 05:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
sorry represent Bixby I didn't see your
 
05:25:38.150 --> 05:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
hand yeah well it was a little slow in
 
05:25:41.810 --> 05:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
raising it I just wanted to make sure
 
05:25:45.050 --> 05:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
that the uh your suggestions are all
 
05:25:47.208 --> 05:25:47.218 align:start position:0%
clearly laid out in the uh written
 
05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
testimonials written testimony you gave
 
05:25:51.230 --> 05:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
us in terms of if we wanted to look at
 
05:25:53.330 --> 05:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
those for language they certainly are
 
05:25:57.470 --> 05:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:08.208 --> 05:26:08.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:11.570 --> 05:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh committee and chairman
 
05:26:14.448 --> 05:26:14.458 align:start position:0%
and the chairwoman excuse me this is my
 
05:26:16.368 --> 05:26:16.378 align:start position:0%
first time ever testifying in front of a
 
05:26:18.708 --> 05:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
committee or in any particular
 
05:26:20.750 --> 05:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
um issue in front of the state and I'm
 
05:26:22.190 --> 05:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
I'm very pleased to be in front of you
 
05:26:24.110 --> 05:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
here a little bit nervous so just bear
 
05:26:27.948 --> 05:26:27.958 align:start position:0%
with me as I I talk a little bit here
 
05:26:30.770 --> 05:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
um I my name is Michael Wright I'm from
 
05:26:32.090 --> 05:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
Littleton New Hampshire I was born and
 
05:26:34.368 --> 05:26:34.378 align:start position:0%
raised in Littleton and I've lived in uh
 
05:26:35.868 --> 05:26:35.878 align:start position:0%
the three corners of the state I guess
 
05:26:37.310 --> 05:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
up in the North Country down in the
 
05:26:40.070 --> 05:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
Seacoast as well as around Keene and I
 
05:26:41.750 --> 05:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
can tell you I love this state and
 
05:26:43.730 --> 05:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to love about it and this
 
05:26:46.010 --> 05:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
is a reason why it's a real drop for
 
05:26:48.350 --> 05:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
many people that visit the state as well
 
05:26:50.208 --> 05:26:50.218 align:start position:0%
as they want to move here and one of the
 
05:26:52.310 --> 05:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
primary things is to the beauty of our
 
05:26:55.850 --> 05:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
our state in the waters that we have and
 
05:26:57.830 --> 05:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
so I I'm very pleased to be able to come
 
05:26:59.868 --> 05:26:59.878 align:start position:0%
in front of you and talk about how I
 
05:27:01.610 --> 05:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
feel about making sure that we continue
 
05:27:03.288 --> 05:27:03.298 align:start position:0%
to have clean water in front of the
 
05:27:05.330 --> 05:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
state I got to tell you I'm a little bit
 
05:27:07.250 --> 05:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
fascinated by the whole process today
 
05:27:09.948 --> 05:27:09.958 align:start position:0%
somewhat gobsmacked when I hear that
 
05:27:13.490 --> 05:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
maybe it's not binary it's a binary
 
05:27:16.610 --> 05:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
decision on SB 61 it's either take it or
 
05:27:18.890 --> 05:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
lead it type of proposition that's not
 
05:27:21.350 --> 05:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
how I thought the legislative sausage
 
05:27:23.330 --> 05:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
was actually created I thought it was
 
05:27:23.340 --> 05:27:24.310 align:start position:0%
was actually created I thought it was
through

05:27:24.310 --> 05:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:27:26.868 --> 05:27:26.878 align:start position:0%
discussion and and from argument
 
05:27:28.368 --> 05:27:28.378 align:start position:0%
arguments if you want to call it that
 
05:27:30.230 --> 05:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
but just the Liberation about what's
 
05:27:32.510 --> 05:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
best for the actual policies that you
 
05:27:34.190 --> 05:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
may be working upon
 
05:27:36.470 --> 05:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
I I wanted to take a moment here and
 
05:27:38.570 --> 05:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
read the testimony from Adam Fink I
 
05:27:40.850 --> 05:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
think that you may know of him he's uh
 
05:27:44.030 --> 05:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
Dr Adam pink he's a an environmental uh
 
05:27:46.368 --> 05:27:46.378 align:start position:0%
scientist and he's currently the
 
05:27:48.830 --> 05:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
clinical uh professor of Environmental
 
05:27:50.090 --> 05:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
Health Services over at the University
 
05:27:51.708 --> 05:27:51.718 align:start position:0%
of Michigan
 
05:27:53.750 --> 05:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
so um this won't take I'm not going to
 
05:27:56.288 --> 05:27:56.298 align:start position:0%
read his entire submitted
 
05:27:58.730 --> 05:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
testimony here and I'll abbreviate it a
 
05:28:00.110 --> 05:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
little bit but let me let me go through
 
05:28:00.120 --> 05:28:00.948 align:start position:0%
little bit but let me let me go through
it

05:28:00.948 --> 05:28:00.958 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:28:03.288 --> 05:28:03.298 align:start position:0%
over the last two years the house agreed
 
05:28:05.510 --> 05:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
with the experts who testified that New
 
05:28:07.190 --> 05:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is decades behind the rules of
 
05:28:09.110 --> 05:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
other states and the guidance of the U.S
 
05:28:11.990 --> 05:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
EPA and that the state should require a
 
05:28:13.970 --> 05:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
five-year time of travel setback between
 
05:28:16.310 --> 05:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
new landfills and surface waters
 
05:28:18.530 --> 05:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
using the maximum measured value of
 
05:28:20.930 --> 05:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
site-specific pollutant velocity this
 
05:28:23.208 --> 05:28:23.218 align:start position:0%
formula is actually weaker than the
 
05:28:24.890 --> 05:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
sixth year of the 12-year setbacks in
 
05:28:26.690 --> 05:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
other states that have a thriving
 
05:28:28.730 --> 05:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
landfill Industries some of which
 
05:28:32.150 --> 05:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
actually simply ban landfills and sandy
 
05:28:34.850 --> 05:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
soil like the one proposed up in Dalton
 
05:28:38.270 --> 05:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
this year the DS and the Senate have
 
05:28:39.770 --> 05:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
publicly admitted what the experts have
 
05:28:42.590 --> 05:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
always known the one size fits all 200
 
05:28:44.448 --> 05:28:44.458 align:start position:0%
foot setback is an embarrassment and a
 
05:28:46.550 --> 05:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
danger to our citizens
 
05:28:50.090 --> 05:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
uh unwittingly though excuse me uh the
 
05:28:53.030 --> 05:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
Senate apparently with SB 61 apparently
 
05:28:54.470 --> 05:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
does not appreciate the difference
 
05:28:56.990 --> 05:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
between science and policy between
 
05:28:59.390 --> 05:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
undeniable facts and legitimate disputes
 
05:29:00.830 --> 05:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
over values
 
05:29:03.590 --> 05:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
despite my 35 years experience
 
05:29:05.390 --> 05:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
conducting pioneering research and
 
05:29:06.830 --> 05:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
environmental sciences and
 
05:29:08.570 --> 05:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
evidence-based regulations for federal
 
05:29:10.910 --> 05:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
state and city in environmental agencies
 
05:29:14.150 --> 05:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
I that is a Dr pink should not be
 
05:29:16.190 --> 05:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
empowered to make value-laden policies
 
05:29:18.050 --> 05:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire
 
05:29:20.150 --> 05:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
but neither should any of the other
 
05:29:22.670 --> 05:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
unelected scientists be given this power
 
05:29:25.330 --> 05:29:25.340 align:start position:0%
making policy is the job of the
 
05:29:28.190 --> 05:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
legislature a buck that should not be
 
05:29:30.650 --> 05:29:30.660 align:start position:0%
passed to someone unaccountable perhaps
 
05:29:33.050 --> 05:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
untrained in certain uh and certainly
 
05:29:33.060 --> 05:29:34.430 align:start position:0%
untrained in certain uh and certainly
biased

05:29:34.430 --> 05:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
biased
 
05:29:37.670 --> 05:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
the fallacy at the heart of SB 61 is its
 
05:29:39.350 --> 05:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
false claim that there is still science
 
05:29:42.350 --> 05:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
that a consultant must figure out
 
05:29:45.288 --> 05:29:45.298 align:start position:0%
I can assure you that despite what
 
05:29:46.788 --> 05:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
you'll hear today which we have here
 
05:29:48.530 --> 05:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
today from vested interests the science
 
05:29:49.788 --> 05:29:49.798 align:start position:0%
is settled
 
05:29:52.368 --> 05:29:52.378 align:start position:0%
much indeed is unsettled but that is all
 
05:29:54.050 --> 05:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
policy and values
 
05:29:56.030 --> 05:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
so here's an analogy to the Trap that
 
05:29:58.670 --> 05:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
the Senate has fallen into imagine the
 
05:30:01.010 --> 05:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
legislature had never set a speed for
 
05:30:03.650 --> 05:30:03.660 align:start position:0%
the State Highway of course there will
 
05:30:05.150 --> 05:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
be a legitimate argue over whether the
 
05:30:07.550 --> 05:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
limit should be 40 60 or 100 miles per
 
05:30:10.010 --> 05:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
hour and there'll be a controversy over
 
05:30:11.690 --> 05:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
whether someone should be pulled over
 
05:30:13.910 --> 05:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
for speeding far above the limit for a
 
05:30:15.470 --> 05:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
minute or so or whether the police
 
05:30:17.030 --> 05:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
should have to follow him for an hour
 
05:30:19.490 --> 05:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
and only penalize him if the long run
 
05:30:22.070 --> 05:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
average speed is above the posted limit
 
05:30:24.948 --> 05:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
but there isn't any doubt that we know
 
05:30:27.110 --> 05:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
how to measure the speed of a car we
 
05:30:29.090 --> 05:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
have speedometers and radar guns for
 
05:30:32.330 --> 05:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
this just as we have had very accurate
 
05:30:34.970 --> 05:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
tests for groundwater velocity for many
 
05:30:37.368 --> 05:30:37.378 align:start position:0%
years I heard testimony today that
 
05:30:39.590 --> 05:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
that that's something the state doesn't
 
05:30:42.110 --> 05:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
know anything about I mean it's science
 
05:30:44.510 --> 05:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
so I respectfully defy any of the
 
05:30:47.510 --> 05:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
Consultants supporting that sb61 as is
 
05:30:49.850 --> 05:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
to identify one single issue that
 
05:30:52.610 --> 05:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
requires more research here and Dr pink
 
05:30:55.128 --> 05:30:55.138 align:start position:0%
has submitted a one-page chart that
 
05:30:57.530 --> 05:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
explains what could possibly be the
 
05:30:59.628 --> 05:30:59.638 align:start position:0%
major value judgments that a consultant
 
05:31:01.190 --> 05:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
report will make
 
05:31:03.170 --> 05:31:03.180 align:start position:0%
so the Senate wants to Outsource the
 
05:31:05.090 --> 05:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
policy to a consultant rather than to
 
05:31:07.070 --> 05:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
make the hard choices about how to be
 
05:31:09.230 --> 05:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
protected this is especially
 
05:31:12.288 --> 05:31:12.298 align:start position:0%
disappointing because HB 56 had already
 
05:31:15.170 --> 05:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
made that hard choice and in a common
 
05:31:17.448 --> 05:31:17.458 align:start position:0%
sense way on the successes of the states
 
05:31:20.030 --> 05:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
and on the science but it's even worse
 
05:31:23.030 --> 05:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
than this you all know precisely what
 
05:31:25.490 --> 05:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
the answer would be if you awarded a
 
05:31:28.010 --> 05:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
speed limit contract to a consultant out
 
05:31:30.170 --> 05:31:30.180 align:start position:0%
of Ferrari we've studied the issue and
 
05:31:31.368 --> 05:31:31.378 align:start position:0%
we think everyone should be able to
 
05:31:33.650 --> 05:31:33.660 align:start position:0%
derive 120 miles per hour on the road
 
05:31:36.590 --> 05:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
anytime after all all studies show that
 
05:31:38.690 --> 05:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
someone once did that and didn't yet
 
05:31:40.190 --> 05:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
kill anyone
 
05:31:42.350 --> 05:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
I and others have offered a small set of
 
05:31:44.868 --> 05:31:44.878 align:start position:0%
technical changes to sb61 it can be
 
05:31:47.750 --> 05:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
improved to make a somewhat less of a
 
05:31:50.510 --> 05:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
giveaway to the regulated industry it
 
05:31:52.910 --> 05:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
would still Outsource policy policy
 
05:31:55.788 --> 05:31:55.798 align:start position:0%
authority to one or more Consultants but
 
05:31:57.948 --> 05:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
at least it would balance uh balance
 
05:31:59.990 --> 05:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
this mistake with meaningful expert
 
05:32:03.050 --> 05:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
review and respectable public input with
 
05:32:05.690 --> 05:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
reason Des responses to it
 
05:32:08.150 --> 05:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
but even with these changes it would be
 
05:32:09.650 --> 05:32:09.660 align:start position:0%
a huge concession for the house to
 
05:32:13.010 --> 05:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
accept the premise of sb61 that a
 
05:32:14.930 --> 05:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
consultant actually should make the
 
05:32:17.270 --> 05:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
environmental policy for the state
 
05:32:19.850 --> 05:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
so there is one simple way to change one
 
05:32:22.788 --> 05:32:22.798 align:start position:0%
aspect of SB 661 to satisfy the
 
05:32:25.010 --> 05:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
perceived need for more study without
 
05:32:26.810 --> 05:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
leaving the state at the mercy of one
 
05:32:29.750 --> 05:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
unelected person's preferences the
 
05:32:32.090 --> 05:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
legislature should direct the consultant
 
05:32:34.128 --> 05:32:34.138 align:start position:0%
to make the recommendation directly to
 
05:32:36.590 --> 05:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
the elected officials and you would then
 
05:32:39.410 --> 05:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
instruct Des how to change its dangerous
 
05:32:42.410 --> 05:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
rules this would compromise between the
 
05:32:44.330 --> 05:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
legislative branch to finish the job now
 
05:32:48.110 --> 05:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
as HB 56 would have done and never doing
 
05:32:50.750 --> 05:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
the job as SB 61 in its present form
 
05:32:52.128 --> 05:32:52.138 align:start position:0%
would do
 
05:32:54.890 --> 05:32:54.900 align:start position:0%
this way the legislature can at least
 
05:32:57.170 --> 05:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
have opened the possibility of creating
 
05:32:59.628 --> 05:32:59.638 align:start position:0%
a balanced precautionary setback rule
 
05:33:02.090 --> 05:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
that will achieve its crucial and very
 
05:33:05.330 --> 05:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
long overdue goal to steer applicants
 
05:33:07.730 --> 05:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
away from the tiny minority of the worst
 
05:33:11.690 --> 05:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
most obviously ruinous places where pfas
 
05:33:14.090 --> 05:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
Laden trash need never and should never
 
05:33:17.690 --> 05:33:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:19.430 --> 05:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
I really can't take many questions for
 
05:33:28.330 --> 05:33:28.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:30.770 --> 05:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
just a clarification on the name is that
 
05:33:34.310 --> 05:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
is that Dr Adam Finkel f-i-n-c-k my
 
05:33:35.990 --> 05:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
apologies and I know he's watching
 
05:33:37.250 --> 05:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
online he could make it here today
 
05:33:38.990 --> 05:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
because he had some medical appointments
 
05:33:40.610 --> 05:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
and uh I'll be hearing from him because
 
05:33:43.368 --> 05:33:43.378 align:start position:0%
it's actually Adam Finkel okay thank you
 
05:33:45.288 --> 05:33:45.298 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
05:33:47.930 --> 05:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
any further questions thank you for your
 
05:33:49.850 --> 05:33:49.860 align:start position:0%
time thank you
 
05:34:00.350 --> 05:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:02.930 --> 05:34:02.940 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
05:34:04.550 --> 05:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair and committee
 
05:34:06.110 --> 05:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
members uh thank you for this
 
05:34:07.610 --> 05:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide testimony and
 
05:34:10.730 --> 05:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
comments to uh sb61 my testimonies in
 
05:34:13.310 --> 05:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
support of SB 61 I've provided written
 
05:34:15.230 --> 05:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
comments of my own as well as a
 
05:34:17.208 --> 05:34:17.218 align:start position:0%
colleague Eric steinhauser and we will
 
05:34:18.470 --> 05:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
be emailing the comments to the
 
05:34:20.390 --> 05:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
committee as well
 
05:34:22.070 --> 05:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
my name is Tim White I'm a vice

headquartered in Bedford we currently
 
05:34:32.030 --> 05:34:32.040 align:start position:0%

05:34:33.530 --> 05:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's lined in unlined
 
05:34:33.540 --> 05:34:34.670 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's lined in unlined
landfills

05:34:34.670 --> 05:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
05:34:36.110 --> 05:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
our environmental and Engineering
 
05:34:39.470 --> 05:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
clients also include nhdes and Dot
 
05:34:41.330 --> 05:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
I'm a hydrogeologist at San Juan hand
 
05:34:42.650 --> 05:34:42.660 align:start position:0%
and I've worked in the field of geology
 
05:34:45.230 --> 05:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
for over 21 years I'm a licensed
 
05:34:46.490 --> 05:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
professional geologist in New Hampshire
 
05:34:48.770 --> 05:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
as well as five other states
 
05:34:50.570 --> 05:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
I want to Briefly summarize two key
 
05:34:53.470 --> 05:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
points in support of sb61 the first
 
05:34:55.850 --> 05:34:55.860 align:start position:0%
sp-61 uses science and requires
 
05:34:57.650 --> 05:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
site-specific approach for determining
 
05:34:59.868 --> 05:34:59.878 align:start position:0%
landfill setbacks to Perennial surface
 
05:35:02.868 --> 05:35:02.878 align:start position:0%
water and secondly sb61 proposes that
 
05:35:05.448 --> 05:35:05.458 align:start position:0%
Des engage a qualified contractor to
 
05:35:06.770 --> 05:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
study the setback rules and make
 
05:35:09.410 --> 05:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
recommendations regarding the first
 
05:35:10.990 --> 05:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
point the science
 
05:35:13.368 --> 05:35:13.378 align:start position:0%
sp61 requires calculation of
 
05:35:14.810 --> 05:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
Representative groundwater travel times
 
05:35:17.330 --> 05:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
using site-specific information it does
 
05:35:19.128 --> 05:35:19.138 align:start position:0%
not require a rely on a
 
05:35:20.990 --> 05:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all approach which would
 
05:35:23.030 --> 05:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
not be representative to conditions at
 
05:35:26.208 --> 05:35:26.218 align:start position:0%
most sites additionally sb61 includes
 
05:35:28.070 --> 05:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
options for specific engineering
 
05:35:29.750 --> 05:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
improvements that provide enhanced
 
05:35:31.550 --> 05:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
protection for human health in the
 
05:35:31.560 --> 05:35:32.510 align:start position:0%
protection for human health in the
environment

05:35:32.510 --> 05:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
environment
 
05:35:34.850 --> 05:35:34.860 align:start position:0%
these measures provide secondary and in
 
05:35:37.550 --> 05:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
some cases tertiary protections that are
 
05:35:39.230 --> 05:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
above and beyond the current state and
 
05:35:40.970 --> 05:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
federal regulations
 
05:35:42.708 --> 05:35:42.718 align:start position:0%
together these important considerations
 
05:35:45.050 --> 05:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
reflect Advantage advances in solid
 
05:35:46.010 --> 05:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
waste engineering and design
 
05:35:48.470 --> 05:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
technologies that offer protection by
 
05:35:50.030 --> 05:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
either decreasing the likelihood a
 
05:35:52.310 --> 05:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
release would occur reducing the impact
 
05:35:54.288 --> 05:35:54.298 align:start position:0%
a potential release may have
 
05:35:56.810 --> 05:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
or increasing the ability to detect and
 
05:35:58.788 --> 05:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
respond to the release
 
05:36:01.250 --> 05:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
regarding my second point the study by
 
05:36:03.590 --> 05:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
qualified Professionals in my opinion
 
05:36:05.270 --> 05:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
the best firm for the study will have
 
05:36:07.190 --> 05:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
several professionals with extensive
 
05:36:09.670 --> 05:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
multi-state Solid Waste landfill design
 
05:36:12.830 --> 05:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
permitting construction operation and
 
05:36:14.330 --> 05:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
monitoring experience
 
05:36:16.430 --> 05:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
although the selected contractors may be
 
05:36:17.750 --> 05:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
professionally licensed in New Hampshire
 
05:36:19.250 --> 05:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
this should not be an absolute
 
05:36:19.260 --> 05:36:20.270 align:start position:0%
this should not be an absolute
requirement

05:36:20.270 --> 05:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
05:36:22.190 --> 05:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
rather the professionals working on the
 
05:36:23.810 --> 05:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
study should have engineering and
 
05:36:25.850 --> 05:36:25.860 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologic expertise and credentials
 
05:36:27.948 --> 05:36:27.958 align:start position:0%
that are materially equivalent to what
 
05:36:30.170 --> 05:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
is required for landfill licensure in
 
05:36:31.788 --> 05:36:31.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:36:33.650 --> 05:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of concern expressed
 
05:36:36.170 --> 05:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
today about uh concerns about interest
 
05:36:38.570 --> 05:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
and lack of interest and transparency in
 
05:36:40.490 --> 05:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
our industry and I just want to say
 
05:36:42.288 --> 05:36:42.298 align:start position:0%
those negative assertions simply aren't
 
05:36:43.730 --> 05:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
based on fact
 
05:36:45.170 --> 05:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
protection of Public Health in the
 
05:36:47.150 --> 05:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
environment is at the very core of what
 
05:36:49.368 --> 05:36:49.378 align:start position:0%
we do as environmental professionals and
 
05:36:51.590 --> 05:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
Engineers every day we are bound by
 
05:36:53.930 --> 05:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations no one's above law
 
05:36:56.330 --> 05:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
as part of our professional licensure we
 
05:36:57.890 --> 05:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
also are bound by a code of strict code
 
05:37:00.230 --> 05:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
of ethics to avoid the types of
 
05:37:01.788 --> 05:37:01.798 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest that were
 
05:37:03.410 --> 05:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
expressed today
 
05:37:05.390 --> 05:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
I'm confident that Des has the ability
 
05:37:06.890 --> 05:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
to vet these real and perceived
 
05:37:08.448 --> 05:37:08.458 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest as part of the com
 
05:37:11.030 --> 05:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
the Contracting process
 
05:37:13.310 --> 05:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
I think though that these tactics ignore
 
05:37:15.288 --> 05:37:15.298 align:start position:0%
that the assessment that is proposed in
 
05:37:18.590 --> 05:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
sv61 to study the setback by qualified
 
05:37:20.930 --> 05:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
professionals is scientifically sound
 
05:37:22.788 --> 05:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
and a responsible approach that makes
 
05:37:24.890 --> 05:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
sense for New Hampshire and it specifies
 
05:37:26.750 --> 05:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
a regional time frame and framework for
 
05:37:29.090 --> 05:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
completion I urge this committee to move
 
05:37:31.910 --> 05:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
forward with SB 61 I'm confident Des
 
05:37:33.410 --> 05:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
will be able to engage a highly
 
05:37:35.810 --> 05:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
qualified professional firm independent
 
05:37:37.670 --> 05:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
to do their work and complete the study
 
05:37:39.650 --> 05:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking forward to reviewing the
 
05:37:39.660 --> 05:37:40.610 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking forward to reviewing the
results

05:37:40.610 --> 05:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
results
 
05:37:42.470 --> 05:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
and I have any questions if the
 
05:37:43.550 --> 05:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
community have would be happy to answer
 
05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
05:37:48.948 --> 05:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
committee representative Howard
 
05:37:50.868 --> 05:37:50.878 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:37:52.368 --> 05:37:52.378 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:37:54.708 --> 05:37:54.718 align:start position:0%
um are you current is Sanborn head
 
05:37:56.930 --> 05:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
currently under contract with the state
 
05:37:59.270 --> 05:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh chamberhead does have a contract with
 
05:38:01.730 --> 05:38:01.740 align:start position:0%
the ES4 environmental work at many of
 
05:38:03.230 --> 05:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
the site Superfund sites and other
 
05:38:04.788 --> 05:38:04.798 align:start position:0%
Brownfield sites that the state manages
 
05:38:06.470 --> 05:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:38:08.690 --> 05:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
representative Dotsy
 
05:38:10.490 --> 05:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:38:12.830 --> 05:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question uh I
 
05:38:14.750 --> 05:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
guess your testimony and the testimony
 
05:38:17.690 --> 05:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
of previous engineering firms has raised
 
05:38:20.330 --> 05:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
a question for me because it's my
 
05:38:22.368 --> 05:38:22.378 align:start position:0%
understanding I mean I I guess I've
 
05:38:24.890 --> 05:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
heard people say that this lays out good
 
05:38:27.110 --> 05:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
scientific information
 
05:38:31.730 --> 05:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
and am I wrong all it does is talk about
 
05:38:36.170 --> 05:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
going out for an RFP and suggests that
 
05:38:38.750 --> 05:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
whoever wins this contract look at some
 
05:38:41.990 --> 05:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
of these things but nothing in this is
 
05:38:45.590 --> 05:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
science and nothing in this uh has to be
 
05:38:48.470 --> 05:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
in the final report am I wrong or is
 
05:38:50.510 --> 05:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
that what this bill is all about thank
 
05:38:52.070 --> 05:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
you for your question representative if
 
05:38:56.030 --> 05:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
I read this bill uh this is uh in
 
05:39:01.190 --> 05:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
Section 3 a on page two the what the
 
05:39:04.128 --> 05:39:04.138 align:start position:0%
proposed language there is offers more
 
05:39:05.448 --> 05:39:05.458 align:start position:0%
specifics than are in the current
 
05:39:07.850 --> 05:39:07.860 align:start position:0%
regulations about how the travel time in
 
05:39:10.190 --> 05:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
groundwater is calculated
 
05:39:13.788 --> 05:39:13.798 align:start position:0%
um specifically lines 26 through 32. I
 
05:39:16.250 --> 05:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
think that's the additional specifics
 
05:39:17.750 --> 05:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
that are being
 
05:39:20.270 --> 05:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
um being added in this bill
 
05:39:24.470 --> 05:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up but yeah aren't these just
 
05:39:26.930 --> 05:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
suggested recommendations I mean I don't
 
05:39:29.628 --> 05:39:29.638 align:start position:0%
I don't see any science I mean I don't
 
05:39:32.448 --> 05:39:32.458 align:start position:0%
see any qualitative information here
 
05:39:34.550 --> 05:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
05:39:38.390 --> 05:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
um I mean for example in HB 56 there was
 
05:39:41.570 --> 05:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
qualitative data you know about you know
 
05:39:45.590 --> 05:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
how far uh yeah I mean how far water
 
05:39:48.470 --> 05:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
should travel and remedies that we
 
05:39:49.310 --> 05:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
should take
 
05:39:52.070 --> 05:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
I just see this as suggestions I mean so
 
05:39:55.128 --> 05:39:55.138 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where I see the science in
 
05:39:56.810 --> 05:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
here so
 
05:39:58.430 --> 05:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
um to answer your follow-up question
 
05:40:00.890 --> 05:40:00.900 align:start position:0%
representative I believe the how the
 
05:40:02.208 --> 05:40:02.218 align:start position:0%
bill is written is it takes those
 
05:40:05.448 --> 05:40:05.458 align:start position:0%
sections uh the language in three and as
 
05:40:07.670 --> 05:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
part of the study one of the outcomes is
 
05:40:10.670 --> 05:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations based on the outcome of
 
05:40:14.510 --> 05:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:16.490 --> 05:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
and it includes recommendations of any
 
05:40:17.990 --> 05:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
other factors that the consultant team
 
05:40:19.970 --> 05:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
is necessary for protection of perennial
 
05:40:21.708 --> 05:40:21.718 align:start position:0%
surface water X I believe there's more
 
05:40:23.270 --> 05:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
specifics that will be coming out of
 
05:40:25.970 --> 05:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:28.490 --> 05:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
05:40:28.500 --> 05:40:29.750 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
germana

05:40:29.750 --> 05:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
germana
 
05:40:31.310 --> 05:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:40:32.690 --> 05:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm hoping you
 
05:40:34.128 --> 05:40:34.138 align:start position:0%
can answer a question that I've had
 
05:40:36.948 --> 05:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
since we heard testimony on on HB 56
 
05:40:39.770 --> 05:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
regarding the use of this term one size
 
05:40:42.708 --> 05:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
fits all and and also the idea of
 
05:40:44.750 --> 05:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
something being site-specific so I'm
 
05:40:46.970 --> 05:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
certainly not a fan of our current 30
 
05:40:49.570 --> 05:40:49.580 align:start position:0%
year old standard of 200 feet I think
 
05:40:52.490 --> 05:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
travel time is is how we should be
 
05:40:54.830 --> 05:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
measuring these things but this is my my
 
05:40:56.930 --> 05:40:56.940 align:start position:0%
question even if taking that 200 foot
 
05:40:56.940 --> 05:40:58.550 align:start position:0%
question even if taking that 200 foot
setback

05:40:58.550 --> 05:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
setback
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
that's a minimum right and and you
 
05:41:03.590 --> 05:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
conduct a series of tests right to
 
05:41:06.050 --> 05:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
determine what the specific geology is
 
05:41:07.550 --> 05:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
at that site
 
05:41:10.368 --> 05:41:10.378 align:start position:0%
and then there is a determination of how
 
05:41:12.530 --> 05:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
far the setback should be
 
05:41:15.490 --> 05:41:15.500 align:start position:0%
is that that is that not
 
05:41:18.650 --> 05:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
site-specific right because with that
 
05:41:20.628 --> 05:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
minimum or if we take a five-year
 
05:41:22.670 --> 05:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
setback the time travel time that we
 
05:41:25.788 --> 05:41:25.798 align:start position:0%
discussed in in HP 56
 
05:41:28.550 --> 05:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
that is a particular standard but you're
 
05:41:30.830 --> 05:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
always doing specific geological testing
 
05:41:32.750 --> 05:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
at the site so whatever the actual
 
05:41:35.030 --> 05:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
setback is whether that's 200 feet or a
 
05:41:37.368 --> 05:41:37.378 align:start position:0%
thousand feet or two miles it still
 
05:41:39.230 --> 05:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
site-specific regardless of that
 
05:41:41.208 --> 05:41:41.218 align:start position:0%
standard and the real and I'm hoping you
 
05:41:42.470 --> 05:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
can clarify this for me I'm thinking
 
05:41:44.030 --> 05:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
about if I go to buy a pair of pants
 
05:41:47.030 --> 05:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
right pants are determined the size is
 
05:41:49.190 --> 05:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
determined by waste and inseam that
 
05:41:51.948 --> 05:41:51.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't make all pants one size fits all
 
05:41:54.470 --> 05:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
right it's you have a set of criteria
 
05:41:57.230 --> 05:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
and then it's specific to the individual
 
05:41:59.030 --> 05:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
so if you could I would appreciate if
 
05:42:00.830 --> 05:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
you could clarify for me this this this
 
05:42:03.288 --> 05:42:03.298 align:start position:0%
language around one size fits all
 
05:42:04.670 --> 05:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
because as long as you're doing the
 
05:42:06.350 --> 05:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
specific testing
 
05:42:09.350 --> 05:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
it is site specific is it not uh sure
 
05:42:10.128 --> 05:42:10.138 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
05:42:11.868 --> 05:42:11.878 align:start position:0%
representative I think
 
05:42:13.910 --> 05:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
um the the one size fits all I'm that
 
05:42:15.890 --> 05:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
I'm referring to the the 200 foot
 
05:42:18.530 --> 05:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
setback under the current regs would not
 
05:42:21.770 --> 05:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
be allowed if Des determined that that
 
05:42:23.330 --> 05:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
is not protective to surface water
 
05:42:24.890 --> 05:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
that's how the current regulations read
 
05:42:27.230 --> 05:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
so no one could put put a landfill at
 
05:42:29.208 --> 05:42:29.218 align:start position:0%
200 feet right now if if it were not
 
05:42:31.490 --> 05:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
protective what I'm referring to
 
05:42:33.350 --> 05:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
specifically with a one-size-fits all is
 
05:42:35.810 --> 05:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
the the other legislation that I've
 
05:42:38.090 --> 05:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
reviewed indicates that a certain
 
05:42:40.490 --> 05:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
maximum values from a site for
 
05:42:42.350 --> 05:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
permeability for instance must be used
 
05:42:45.170 --> 05:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
and that is not specific that would not
 
05:42:46.970 --> 05:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
fall into our site specific it would not
 
05:42:48.770 --> 05:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
be represented to a vast majority of
 
05:42:51.650 --> 05:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
that site potentially and so I juxtapose
 
05:42:54.530 --> 05:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
that that value that is maybe measured
 
05:42:56.628 --> 05:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
at one point in one location it may not
 
05:42:58.490 --> 05:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
be represented for a bulk of the the
 
05:43:00.890 --> 05:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
site and in particularly the area down
 
05:43:02.208 --> 05:43:02.218 align:start position:0%
gradient from the landfill where it
 
05:43:04.368 --> 05:43:04.378 align:start position:0%
really matters
 
05:43:06.650 --> 05:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
in a quick follow-up if I may sure
 
05:43:09.110 --> 05:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
random charges and I guess I I think it
 
05:43:11.628 --> 05:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
is a difference in usage in that case
 
05:43:13.970 --> 05:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
that you just provided right in in terms
 
05:43:16.070 --> 05:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
of thinking about maximum velocity for
 
05:43:18.590 --> 05:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
example the site specif specific element
 
05:43:22.550 --> 05:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
is still the geological
 
05:43:25.788 --> 05:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
you know strata right I mean that so
 
05:43:27.530 --> 05:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
you're right there's a there's a maximum
 
05:43:30.350 --> 05:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
and that would be applied across uh all
 
05:43:33.288 --> 05:43:33.298 align:start position:0%
sites that are tested but then the
 
05:43:35.330 --> 05:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
site-specific element is it not is what
 
05:43:37.850 --> 05:43:37.860 align:start position:0%
you find when you drill down correct so
 
05:43:39.410 --> 05:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
under the under the current regulations
 
05:43:42.110 --> 05:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
I I do not believe I don't mean to speak
 
05:43:43.610 --> 05:43:43.620 align:start position:0%
for DS I do not believe they would look
 
05:43:45.830 --> 05:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
to use a maximum as being representative
 
05:43:47.448 --> 05:43:47.458 align:start position:0%
as a site
 
05:43:49.850 --> 05:43:49.860 align:start position:0%
um under the current the citing rules
 
05:43:51.770 --> 05:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
now and that's what the proposed
 
05:43:53.570 --> 05:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
legislation did was it selected a
 
05:43:55.970 --> 05:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
maximum value and that I'm saying it
 
05:43:57.230 --> 05:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
would not be representative of
 
05:43:59.868 --> 05:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
potentially vast majorities of portions
 
05:44:01.368 --> 05:44:01.378 align:start position:0%
of that site and there's a danger in
 
05:44:03.410 --> 05:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
that because I don't think you're you're
 
05:44:05.930 --> 05:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
getting a representative read on what
 
05:44:07.610 --> 05:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
the the travel time of groundwater might
 
05:44:09.230 --> 05:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
be if you were to take that maximum
 
05:44:09.240 --> 05:44:10.670 align:start position:0%
be if you were to take that maximum
value

05:44:10.670 --> 05:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
value
 
05:44:12.170 --> 05:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
05:44:13.850 --> 05:44:13.860 align:start position:0%
you madam chair any other questions from
 
05:44:17.208 --> 05:44:17.218 align:start position:0%
the committee see yes uh representative
 
05:44:19.610 --> 05:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair
 
05:44:23.090 --> 05:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
um so I guess I understand that there's
 
05:44:25.190 --> 05:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
an engineering piece that goes into it
 
05:44:27.948 --> 05:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
certainly but would you agree that part
 
05:44:31.250 --> 05:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
of our job is a health risk assessment
 
05:44:34.430 --> 05:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
that that's as critical as the
 
05:44:36.410 --> 05:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
engineering that goes into putting the
 
05:44:36.420 --> 05:44:38.090 align:start position:0%
engineering that goes into putting the
landfill

05:44:38.090 --> 05:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
05:44:39.890 --> 05:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for your
 
05:44:41.510 --> 05:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
question I think if I understand it
 
05:44:44.270 --> 05:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
correctly the the um the health risk
 
05:44:46.490 --> 05:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
part I think is addressed by the the
 
05:44:48.230 --> 05:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
water quality standards that we're
 
05:44:50.270 --> 05:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
required to compare to
 
05:44:52.190 --> 05:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
um so the the state publishes numerical
 
05:44:53.930 --> 05:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
values for both groundwater and surface
 
05:44:56.690 --> 05:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
water and that's what what they hold an
 
05:44:59.390 --> 05:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
applicant to for protecting that
 
05:45:00.948 --> 05:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
um in order to protect human health in
 
05:45:02.510 --> 05:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
the environment that comparison to the
 
05:45:04.368 --> 05:45:04.378 align:start position:0%
water quality standards so that is built
 
05:45:06.830 --> 05:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
into the type of Permitting work that
 
05:45:08.510 --> 05:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
geologists and Engineers are involved
 
05:45:16.850 --> 05:45:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:19.850 --> 05:45:19.860 align:start position:0%
with regard to SB 61 it is largely
 
05:45:22.810 --> 05:45:22.820 align:start position:0%
silent on aquifers as has been mentioned
 
05:45:25.610 --> 05:45:25.620 align:start position:0%
do you share any concerns with it being
 
05:45:28.250 --> 05:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
silent on that aspect
 
05:45:28.910 --> 05:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question
 
05:45:28.920 --> 05:45:30.230 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question
representative

05:45:30.230 --> 05:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:45:32.750 --> 05:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify are you the term
 
05:45:34.610 --> 05:45:34.620 align:start position:0%
aquifer is that what you're referring to
 
05:45:37.250 --> 05:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
I I'm not troubled that it's not in the
 
05:45:40.128 --> 05:45:40.138 align:start position:0%
bill because it's a very specific term
 
05:45:42.948 --> 05:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
um for uh that's used to denote places
 
05:45:45.530 --> 05:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
where water may be extracted for potable
 
05:45:47.448 --> 05:45:47.458 align:start position:0%
use and I don't think those are the
 
05:45:49.788 --> 05:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
types of specifics that are being looked
 
05:45:51.650 --> 05:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
at for the landfill
 
05:45:54.470 --> 05:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
um the the bill rather it looks at
 
05:45:56.628 --> 05:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
permeability whether it's called
 
05:45:58.910 --> 05:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
colloquial and aquifer or it's measured
 
05:46:01.368 --> 05:46:01.378 align:start position:0%
by its numeric value its hydraulic
 
05:46:02.628 --> 05:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
conductivity that's referenced in the
 
05:46:04.970 --> 05:46:04.980 align:start position:0%
bill I'd prefer the classification be
 
05:46:06.590 --> 05:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
done on the number the hydraulic
 
05:46:10.190 --> 05:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:12.288 --> 05:46:12.298 align:start position:0%
any other questions thank you so much
 
05:46:15.048 --> 05:46:15.058 align:start position:0%
for uh your testimony today thank you
 
05:46:18.170 --> 05:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
and I now call Nancy Morrison
 
05:46:30.170 --> 05:46:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:30.180 --> 05:46:32.570 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

05:46:32.570 --> 05:46:32.580 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
05:46:35.510 --> 05:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
yes my name is Nancy Morrison and thank
 
05:46:38.330 --> 05:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and this committee for
 
05:46:40.750 --> 05:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
sitting through this very extensive
 
05:46:43.970 --> 05:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
testimony it's a lot
 
05:46:46.070 --> 05:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
um my testimony is two sentences
 
05:46:49.448 --> 05:46:49.458 align:start position:0%
although one of them is long
 
05:46:52.970 --> 05:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
uh as a New Hampshire Citizen and a
 
05:46:56.448 --> 05:46:56.458 align:start position:0%
taxpayer I object to Senate Bill 61 is
 
05:46:59.750 --> 05:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
written it is counterintuitive and if
 
05:47:02.628 --> 05:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers expense that with this
 
05:47:06.530 --> 05:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
bill as written Des can accept and
 
05:47:10.070 --> 05:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
process a new landfill citing permit
 
05:47:13.368 --> 05:47:13.378 align:start position:0%
with their admittedly understaffed and
 
05:47:17.150 --> 05:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
underfunded Department during the
 
05:47:19.628 --> 05:47:19.638 align:start position:0%
proposed two-year study
 
05:47:22.368 --> 05:47:22.378 align:start position:0%
when that permit
 
05:47:25.430 --> 05:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
may not get past the First new sighting
 
05:47:30.530 --> 05:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:33.048 --> 05:47:33.058 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 61 would be a much better
 
05:47:36.470 --> 05:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
bill for the citizens of New Hampshire
 
05:47:39.230 --> 05:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
if it is amended so that Des will not
 
05:47:42.470 --> 05:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
accept and process a new landfill citing
 
05:47:46.970 --> 05:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
permit during the two-year study period
 
05:47:48.530 --> 05:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:47:51.230 --> 05:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
05:47:54.230 --> 05:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
05:47:59.390 --> 05:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:09.770 --> 05:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:09.780 --> 05:48:10.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:48:10.910 --> 05:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:48:13.430 --> 05:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairwoman Aaron members
 
05:48:16.430 --> 05:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
of the committee and everyone
 
05:48:19.610 --> 05:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
I'm Sarah Doucette from Whitefield
 
05:48:22.310 --> 05:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
I have nominated myself to speak for
 
05:48:24.110 --> 05:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
several thousand people
 
05:48:26.448 --> 05:48:26.458 align:start position:0%
who have contacted legislators and the
 
05:48:28.970 --> 05:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
governor over four years all of them
 
05:48:31.190 --> 05:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
calling for responsible sighting of New
 
05:48:33.288 --> 05:48:33.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire landfills to protect the
 
05:48:35.270 --> 05:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
environment their families and
 
05:48:37.128 --> 05:48:37.138 align:start position:0%
communities Statewide
 
05:48:39.288 --> 05:48:39.298 align:start position:0%
I commend the work of the house over
 
05:48:41.810 --> 05:48:41.820 align:start position:0%
those years for being responsive and
 
05:48:43.730 --> 05:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
honoring the Democratic process that
 
05:48:46.490 --> 05:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
binds excuse me Mr said would you be
 
05:48:49.250 --> 05:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
able to speak a little louder sorry
 
05:48:52.190 --> 05:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
sorry I can ditch this too
 
05:48:52.200 --> 05:48:53.510 align:start position:0%
sorry I can ditch this too
um

05:48:53.510 --> 05:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:56.150 --> 05:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
so we have made progress together
 
05:48:58.548 --> 05:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
with Senate Bill 61 this committee has
 
05:49:00.350 --> 05:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
the opportunity in the coming days to
 
05:49:03.048 --> 05:49:03.058 align:start position:0%
craft a truly effective bill that may
 
05:49:06.770 --> 05:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
finally win bipartisan support write to
 
05:49:09.230 --> 05:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
the governor's office in spite of his
 
05:49:12.410 --> 05:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
Representatives comments to us today
 
05:49:15.350 --> 05:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
as written Senate Bill 61 is only a
 
05:49:17.448 --> 05:49:17.458 align:start position:0%
rough outline of what is needed for a
 
05:49:19.610 --> 05:49:19.620 align:start position:0%
meaningful study what's missing is the
 
05:49:21.170 --> 05:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
means to assure integrity and
 
05:49:21.180 --> 05:49:22.850 align:start position:0%
means to assure integrity and
accountability

05:49:22.850 --> 05:49:22.860 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
05:49:24.708 --> 05:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
you and your house colleagues can put
 
05:49:26.570 --> 05:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
the essential amendment in place to turn
 
05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
this bill into a worthwhile and
 
05:49:31.070 --> 05:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
definitive piece of legislation for New
 
05:49:32.990 --> 05:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Waters and Public Health
 
05:49:35.030 --> 05:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
anything short of that will leave the
 
05:49:37.548 --> 05:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
state with an empty process an
 
05:49:39.048 --> 05:49:39.058 align:start position:0%
illegitimate outcome and yet another
 
05:49:41.868 --> 05:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
failed attempt at water protection
 
05:49:43.850 --> 05:49:43.860 align:start position:0%
most important your work can make
 
05:49:45.288 --> 05:49:45.298 align:start position:0%
certain that New Hampshire never again
 
05:49:47.350 --> 05:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
uses the existing and frightening
 
05:49:50.330 --> 05:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
200-foot setback rule as a buffer
 
05:49:51.948 --> 05:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
between landfills and perennial water
 
05:49:54.110 --> 05:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
bodies it is appalling that that
 
05:49:56.270 --> 05:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
regulation stands
 
05:49:58.430 --> 05:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
given all we know about rampant pfas
 
05:50:01.368 --> 05:50:01.378 align:start position:0%
contamination defaulting to the 200 foot
 
05:50:04.368 --> 05:50:04.378 align:start position:0%
buffer as written now in Senate Bill 61
 
05:50:06.890 --> 05:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
should the study and Rule enactment run
 
05:50:10.310 --> 05:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
more than 24 months is unacceptable
 
05:50:12.530 --> 05:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
study must be completed with updated and
 
05:50:14.990 --> 05:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
protective regulation regulations in
 
05:50:18.110 --> 05:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
effect before any permit is granted for
 
05:50:20.208 --> 05:50:20.218 align:start position:0%
a new landfill facility
 
05:50:22.070 --> 05:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
and in truth the whole process will
 
05:50:24.708 --> 05:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
likely require a timeline that cannot be
 
05:50:27.530 --> 05:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
set responsibly in advance at 24 months
 
05:50:30.048 --> 05:50:30.058 align:start position:0%
or perhaps at any other specific number
 
05:50:31.310 --> 05:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
of months
 
05:50:33.410 --> 05:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
your work in amending will also require
 
05:50:35.208 --> 05:50:35.218 align:start position:0%
attention to the search for credible
 
05:50:38.150 --> 05:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
unbiased Consultants attention to the
 
05:50:40.548 --> 05:50:40.558 align:start position:0%
criteria to guide their research and
 
05:50:42.350 --> 05:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
attention to engineering specifications
 
05:50:44.990 --> 05:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
and engineering's limitations
 
05:50:47.090 --> 05:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
as well as human and environmental
 
05:50:49.010 --> 05:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
health considerations
 
05:50:50.990 --> 05:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
public involvement with the es both
 
05:50:53.448 --> 05:50:53.458 align:start position:0%
assessing and including stakeholder
 
05:50:56.150 --> 05:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
input is another requisite
 
05:50:57.948 --> 05:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
it's been worrisome to hear in
 
05:50:59.810 --> 05:50:59.820 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies that everyone here is
 
05:51:01.610 --> 05:51:01.620 align:start position:0%
earnestly concerned about clean water
 
05:51:04.970 --> 05:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
only to have votes cast against exactly
 
05:51:06.948 --> 05:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
the measures that would ensure clean
 
05:51:06.958 --> 05:51:08.690 align:start position:0%
the measures that would ensure clean
water

05:51:08.690 --> 05:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
water
 
05:51:10.368 --> 05:51:10.378 align:start position:0%
if we want clean water we have to be
 
05:51:10.378 --> 05:51:11.690 align:start position:0%
if we want clean water we have to be
courageous

05:51:11.690 --> 05:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
courageous
 
05:51:13.788 --> 05:51:13.798 align:start position:0%
today's the time to be all in for an
 
05:51:13.798 --> 05:51:14.750 align:start position:0%
today's the time to be all in for an
amended

05:51:14.750 --> 05:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
amended
 
05:51:17.208 --> 05:51:17.218 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 61 that can do the job we
 
05:51:19.730 --> 05:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
need I respectfully ask you committee
 
05:51:21.708 --> 05:51:21.718 align:start position:0%
members to act on the convictions that
 
05:51:23.570 --> 05:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
you all expressed earlier in this
 
05:51:26.090 --> 05:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
session please be the diligent leaders
 
05:51:28.010 --> 05:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
we need to assure that New Hampshire
 
05:51:29.990 --> 05:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
never again operates with feeble
 
05:51:33.110 --> 05:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
regulations for landfill citing
 
05:51:34.970 --> 05:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
and please remember that I speak for
 
05:51:37.250 --> 05:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
your constituents and their families
 
05:51:41.330 --> 05:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
picture a few of them just for a moment
 
05:51:43.310 --> 05:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
they're asking you for clean drinking
 
05:51:45.948 --> 05:51:45.958 align:start position:0%
and recreational Waters
 
05:51:48.350 --> 05:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
and I want to add one more thing just
 
05:51:52.128 --> 05:51:52.138 align:start position:0%
before I close as a private citizen
 
05:51:55.010 --> 05:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
um watching the creation of Senate Bill
 
05:51:55.020 --> 05:51:56.208 align:start position:0%
um watching the creation of Senate Bill
61

05:51:56.208 --> 05:51:56.218 align:start position:0%
61
 
05:51:59.330 --> 05:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
I have to say that the experience the
 
05:52:01.788 --> 05:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
public had in the Senate hearing was
 
05:52:04.548 --> 05:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
incredibly dismissive and for this the
 
05:52:05.990 --> 05:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
preparation of this bill to be
 
05:52:08.990 --> 05:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
represented as an inclusive and uh
 
05:52:11.810 --> 05:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
transparent process from my perspective
 
05:52:14.270 --> 05:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
as someone who's paying attention on
 
05:52:17.570 --> 05:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
Earthly the public really has been quite
 
05:52:20.208 --> 05:52:20.218 align:start position:0%
shut out until today in that process
 
05:52:22.970 --> 05:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
and you know the governor I feel the
 
05:52:25.010 --> 05:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
governor is not in process with us when
 
05:52:27.350 --> 05:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
I hear his Representatives say that his
 
05:52:29.208 --> 05:52:29.218 align:start position:0%
decision is already made and it's
 
05:52:30.770 --> 05:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
interesting to me that that
 
05:52:32.868 --> 05:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
representative may not even be here
 
05:52:35.810 --> 05:52:35.820 align:start position:0%
listening to anything beyond his
 
05:52:38.208 --> 05:52:38.218 align:start position:0%
statement that he gave to us today
 
05:52:41.930 --> 05:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
so uh I I really I've done a lot of
 
05:52:45.170 --> 05:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
public comment and um
 
05:52:48.070 --> 05:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
I would like to feel that it is uh
 
05:52:51.110 --> 05:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
included in decision making and that we
 
05:52:53.810 --> 05:52:53.820 align:start position:0%
really are in the stakeholder Circle
 
05:52:56.448 --> 05:52:56.458 align:start position:0%
because it's really hard you know to get
 
05:52:58.610 --> 05:52:58.620 align:start position:0%
500 votes in favor of a piece of
 
05:53:01.610 --> 05:53:01.620 align:start position:0%
legislation and a handful against and it
 
05:53:03.110 --> 05:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to make a wit of difference
 
05:53:06.048 --> 05:53:06.058 align:start position:0%
in the end so you have tremendous
 
05:53:08.090 --> 05:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
Integrity for going through this with us
 
05:53:10.788 --> 05:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
today I'm terrifically grateful I thank
 
05:53:13.730 --> 05:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
you and I you know I look forward to
 
05:53:16.190 --> 05:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
your wholehearted work on this bill I I
 
05:53:18.590 --> 05:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
have a lot of confidence in your
 
05:53:21.530 --> 05:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
commitment and through your earnest wish
 
05:53:23.628 --> 05:53:23.638 align:start position:0%
to do something meaningful
 
05:53:27.310 --> 05:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any questions for Mr
 
05:53:29.868 --> 05:53:29.878 align:start position:0%
representative Murray sorry thank you
 
05:53:31.250 --> 05:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
madam chair this isn't that a question
 
05:53:32.150 --> 05:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
for say
 
05:53:34.190 --> 05:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
just clerking um you didn't indicate
 
05:53:36.048 --> 05:53:36.058 align:start position:0%
support or opposition on here and if
 
05:53:37.548 --> 05:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
that was intentional that's fine but I
 
05:53:38.868 --> 05:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure that if you
 
05:53:40.430 --> 05:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I would only support with
 
05:53:42.170 --> 05:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
amendments thank you for pointing that
 
05:53:43.730 --> 05:53:43.740 align:start position:0%
out I appreciate it thank you
 
05:53:47.090 --> 05:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:49.128 --> 05:53:49.138 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony I
 
05:53:51.288 --> 05:53:51.298 align:start position:0%
think that um so many things of what you
 
05:53:53.090 --> 05:53:53.100 align:start position:0%
said kind of ring true with some of the
 
05:53:54.948 --> 05:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
questions that we had I would love you
 
05:53:57.590 --> 05:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
to define the word stakeholder
 
05:53:59.208 --> 05:53:59.218 align:start position:0%
um what you think the word stakeholder
 
05:54:02.030 --> 05:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
means in regards with our commitment to
 
05:54:04.250 --> 05:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
the public
 
05:54:07.730 --> 05:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
well I mean you could guess I would stay
 
05:54:10.190 --> 05:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
your constituents there are so many of
 
05:54:12.350 --> 05:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
us you know we're talking about one
 
05:54:15.230 --> 05:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
industry here and a relative handful of
 
05:54:17.270 --> 05:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
people who I understand they have a
 
05:54:19.548 --> 05:54:19.558 align:start position:0%
business interest and that's fine
 
05:54:22.850 --> 05:54:22.860 align:start position:0%
but youth I don't mean just you the
 
05:54:24.590 --> 05:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
legislature and the governor have heard
 
05:54:24.600 --> 05:54:25.990 align:start position:0%
legislature and the governor have heard
such

05:54:25.990 --> 05:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
such
 
05:54:29.270 --> 05:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
overwhelming input from stakeholders for
 
05:54:31.190 --> 05:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
so long I mean
 
05:54:33.110 --> 05:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
I don't like it very well that the
 
05:54:36.170 --> 05:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
governor and the industry are primary
 
05:54:39.070 --> 05:54:39.080 align:start position:0%
somehow on some level of stakeholdership
 
05:54:42.110 --> 05:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
that none of us can achieve no matter
 
05:54:44.868 --> 05:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
what we do I mean that's just it's an
 
05:54:46.670 --> 05:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
odd if you want to talk about democracy
 
05:54:48.230 --> 05:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
meaning something
 
05:54:51.048 --> 05:54:51.058 align:start position:0%
that's not what it's about
 
05:54:53.270 --> 05:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
no I don't know if I've answered your
 
05:54:55.850 --> 05:54:55.860 align:start position:0%
question but I think everybody counts
 
05:54:57.350 --> 05:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
not just
 
05:55:00.708 --> 05:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
the big folks not just the people who
 
05:55:02.930 --> 05:55:02.940 align:start position:0%
are maybe entrenched in industry or in
 
05:55:02.940 --> 05:55:04.128 align:start position:0%
are maybe entrenched in industry or in
government

05:55:04.128 --> 05:55:04.138 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:55:07.190 --> 05:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
we're in a crisis no you answered it
 
05:55:09.470 --> 05:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
perfectly thank you thank you
 
05:55:11.570 --> 05:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
05:55:13.190 --> 05:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony I
 
05:55:16.310 --> 05:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:24.708 --> 05:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:26.628 --> 05:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and welcome to
 
05:55:28.368 --> 05:55:28.378 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture
 
05:55:30.410 --> 05:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I do have a copy
 
05:55:32.270 --> 05:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
of my remarks that'll pass out
 
05:55:32.280 --> 05:55:33.470 align:start position:0%
of my remarks that'll pass out
afterwards

05:55:33.470 --> 05:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
05:55:35.570 --> 05:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
my name is Muriel Robinette and I
 
05:55:37.250 --> 05:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
appreciate being able to address you
 
05:55:39.650 --> 05:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
here I've been practicing hydrogeology
 
05:55:41.750 --> 05:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
for more than 40 Years in New England
 
05:55:43.250 --> 05:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm a licensed professional
 
05:55:45.470 --> 05:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
geologist in New Hampshire and in Maine
 
05:55:48.350 --> 05:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
Maine of which is a a neighboring state
 
05:55:50.448 --> 05:55:50.458 align:start position:0%
which has landfills and landfill
 
05:55:53.208 --> 05:55:53.218 align:start position:0%
regulations that happen to be quite more
 
05:55:56.628 --> 05:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
specific than what ours are I am
 
05:56:00.110 --> 05:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
speaking in support of Senate bill 61.
 
05:56:03.470 --> 05:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
and why is that well because our 200
 
05:56:06.470 --> 05:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
foot setback is currently technically
 
05:56:09.730 --> 05:56:09.740 align:start position:0%
inadequate it's actually pretty scary
 
05:56:12.770 --> 05:56:12.780 align:start position:0%
and we think of New Hampshire as being a
 
05:56:15.110 --> 05:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
small comfortable little State and yet
 
05:56:18.288 --> 05:56:18.298 align:start position:0%
we have tens of millions of acres of
 
05:56:21.170 --> 05:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
land in our state and the next landfill
 
05:56:24.230 --> 05:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
probably needs two or three hundred
 
05:56:26.090 --> 05:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
of those Acres
 
05:56:29.810 --> 05:56:29.820 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at a very site-specific
 
05:56:32.208 --> 05:56:32.218 align:start position:0%
feature that we're wanting to put in
 
05:56:34.190 --> 05:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
this state which is going to create
 
05:56:36.890 --> 05:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
leachate and contamination for about a
 
05:56:39.830 --> 05:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
hundred years that has to be managed and
 
05:56:42.410 --> 05:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
addressed and taken care of
 
05:56:44.750 --> 05:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
so how we cite
 
05:56:47.990 --> 05:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
that next landfill is very crucial to
 
05:56:49.250 --> 05:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
your grandchildren and maybe
 
05:56:49.260 --> 05:56:50.868 align:start position:0%
your grandchildren and maybe
great-grandchildren

05:56:50.868 --> 05:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
great-grandchildren
 
05:56:53.448 --> 05:56:53.458 align:start position:0%
so I think we need to do it carefully as
 
05:56:56.930 --> 05:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
a geologist I love the state and we have
 
05:56:59.868 --> 05:56:59.878 align:start position:0%
two main features that we we deal with
 
05:57:01.910 --> 05:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
in this state one is we have beautiful
 
05:57:04.490 --> 05:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
White Mountains and they came about from
 
05:57:07.490 --> 05:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
Mountain building forces which rose up
 
05:57:10.670 --> 05:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
the Bedrock and created fracture systems
 
05:57:13.190 --> 05:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
within the rock but for those of you
 
05:57:15.530 --> 05:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
who've had to drill a well for a water
 
05:57:18.048 --> 05:57:18.058 align:start position:0%
supply you might have gotten a duster
 
05:57:20.390 --> 05:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
you might have put in a well and maybe
 
05:57:23.690 --> 05:57:23.700 align:start position:0%
gotten a quart a minute of water and yet
 
05:57:26.510 --> 05:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
a quarter of a mile away or half a mile
 
05:57:26.520 --> 05:57:27.590 align:start position:0%
a quarter of a mile away or half a mile
away

05:57:27.590 --> 05:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
away
 
05:57:29.690 --> 05:57:29.700 align:start position:0%
someone drills a well and they get a
 
05:57:32.150 --> 05:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
hundred gallons a minute or 200 gallons
 
05:57:34.128 --> 05:57:34.138 align:start position:0%
a minute if you're a municipality and
 
05:57:36.470 --> 05:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
have used some some good science in
 
05:57:39.288 --> 05:57:39.298 align:start position:0%
finding those fracture systems
 
05:57:43.010 --> 05:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
so we have great variability in this
 
05:57:43.020 --> 05:57:44.390 align:start position:0%
so we have great variability in this
state

05:57:44.390 --> 05:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:57:48.230 --> 05:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
the other feature that we have a lot of
 
05:57:51.350 --> 05:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
to thank for are the glaciers that came
 
05:57:53.208 --> 05:57:53.218 align:start position:0%
through about 15 million years ago
 
05:57:56.090 --> 05:57:56.100 align:start position:0%
because the glaciers scraped our
 
05:57:59.350 --> 05:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
mountains and they left behind a very
 
05:58:02.868 --> 05:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
clay-rich Stony substance called till
 
05:58:04.670 --> 05:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
and if you've ever tried to grow a
 
05:58:06.770 --> 05:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
garden in it good luck because it
 
05:58:08.810 --> 05:58:08.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't move water very easily for you
 
05:58:11.810 --> 05:58:11.820 align:start position:0%
but the glaciers also left us excellent
 
05:58:14.030 --> 05:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
sand and gravel deposits where it was
 
05:58:17.208 --> 05:58:17.218 align:start position:0%
flowing all the melting back
 
05:58:21.170 --> 05:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
so that too is site specific so when we
 
05:58:24.650 --> 05:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
cite a landfill maybe we ought to look
 
05:58:28.010 --> 05:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
for some of these features which can
 
05:58:31.670 --> 05:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
pass groundwater very very rapidly sand
 
05:58:34.788 --> 05:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
and gravel it can pass tens of feet a
 
05:58:37.548 --> 05:58:37.558 align:start position:0%
day of groundwater which means if
 
05:58:40.430 --> 05:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
contaminants get gets in it it can move
 
05:58:42.410 --> 05:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
tens of feeds a day
 
05:58:46.190 --> 05:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
with a contamination so how can possibly
 
05:58:49.910 --> 05:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
a 200 foot setback be adequate for a
 
05:58:51.288 --> 05:58:51.298 align:start position:0%
site that would have that kind of a
 
05:58:54.470 --> 05:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
deposit the same concept for fractured
 
05:58:57.830 --> 05:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
Rock if you have high fractures it can
 
05:59:01.250 --> 05:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
pass ground water quite rapidly too so
 
05:59:03.770 --> 05:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
all we're looking for and needing to
 
05:59:06.788 --> 05:59:06.798 align:start position:0%
have to be protective in this state is
 
05:59:10.490 --> 05:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
site-specific citing criteria now
 
05:59:12.830 --> 05:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
certainly we have a lot of site specific
 
05:59:15.708 --> 05:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
criteria that is evaluated when a permit
 
05:59:18.850 --> 05:59:18.860 align:start position:0%
is applied and we have very competent
 
05:59:21.610 --> 05:59:21.620 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologists in the state in the Des
 
05:59:24.708 --> 05:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
and in the private sector there some of
 
05:59:26.208 --> 05:59:26.218 align:start position:0%
them are sitting here now and I highly
 
05:59:28.128 --> 05:59:28.138 align:start position:0%
respect their capabilities
 
05:59:31.070 --> 05:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
what we want to see is them to apply
 
05:59:33.788 --> 05:59:33.798 align:start position:0%
that site-specific information
 
05:59:39.170 --> 05:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
to the inevitable situation of leachate
 
05:59:39.180 --> 05:59:41.208 align:start position:0%
to the inevitable situation of leachate
transport

05:59:41.208 --> 05:59:41.218 align:start position:0%
transport
 
05:59:45.590 --> 05:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
so the upshot of it all is that this
 
05:59:48.590 --> 05:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 61 says let's study it
 
05:59:51.948 --> 05:59:51.958 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a admirable concept and
 
05:59:54.650 --> 05:59:54.660 align:start position:0%
admirable from the standpoint of how
 
05:59:56.270 --> 05:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
much can you do for a hundred and fifty
 
05:59:58.490 --> 05:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
06:00:01.310 --> 06:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a desktop study it's
 
06:00:04.070 --> 06:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
going to be a statistical analysis it
 
06:00:06.048 --> 06:00:06.058 align:start position:0%
will be a study that looks at some of
 
06:00:08.270 --> 06:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
the other states that and how they do
 
06:00:11.030 --> 06:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
setbacks which is all good and valuable
 
06:00:12.650 --> 06:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
and useful
 
06:00:16.670 --> 06:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
to the GES and how they change their
 
06:00:20.090 --> 06:00:20.100 align:start position:0%
setback criteria for landfills so we
 
06:00:21.830 --> 06:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
need to give them the time to do that
 
06:00:24.970 --> 06:00:24.980 align:start position:0%
job we need to allow the science to be
 
06:00:28.910 --> 06:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
applied in the study and that advice
 
06:00:31.430 --> 06:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
given to Des and they'll very
 
06:00:34.670 --> 06:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
competently evaluate it with respect to
 
06:00:36.730 --> 06:00:36.740 align:start position:0%
sighting of landfills
 
06:00:41.570 --> 06:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
and I would just implore you to not
 
06:00:45.110 --> 06:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
allow this work this good work which
 
06:00:47.990 --> 06:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
will happen to be circumvented by the
 
06:00:50.270 --> 06:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
fact that it might miss its deadline by
 
06:00:52.690 --> 06:00:52.700 align:start position:0%
a month or two or three
 
06:00:55.730 --> 06:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
landfills create contamination for 100
 
06:00:58.970 --> 06:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
years and where we put the next one is
 
06:01:00.708 --> 06:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
really important particularly when we
 
06:01:03.470 --> 06:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
know about our pfas concentrations in
 
06:01:05.330 --> 06:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
the leachate we don't want that getting
 
06:01:07.850 --> 06:01:07.860 align:start position:0%
into our water supplies
 
06:01:11.090 --> 06:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
so let's give them the time and let's
 
06:01:14.628 --> 06:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
not have a sunset clause on that 200
 
06:01:18.470 --> 06:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:20.948 --> 06:01:20.958 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
06:01:31.690 --> 06:01:31.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:33.788 --> 06:01:33.798 align:start position:0%
150 000
 
06:01:37.310 --> 06:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh in the appropriation were you saying
 
06:01:39.170 --> 06:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
that you believed that was adequate or
 
06:01:41.208 --> 06:01:41.218 align:start position:0%
inadequate I just wanted to clarify for
 
06:01:42.590 --> 06:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
the record
 
06:01:46.128 --> 06:01:46.138 align:start position:0%
well I think 150 000 is adequate for a
 
06:01:48.948 --> 06:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
desktop study and I think that is is
 
06:01:52.150 --> 06:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
makes sense because for anything
 
06:01:54.890 --> 06:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
additional in other words to expect a
 
06:01:57.530 --> 06:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
consultant to go out and do independent
 
06:02:00.530 --> 06:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
permeability testing or any kind of
 
06:02:04.850 --> 06:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
field analysis is is going to be biased
 
06:02:08.090 --> 06:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
by how much and where they can do it so
 
06:02:10.970 --> 06:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not criticizing it I'm just pointing
 
06:02:13.670 --> 06:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
that out as the fact that it's going to
 
06:02:16.548 --> 06:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
be a desktop study but it will develop
 
06:02:19.310 --> 06:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
excellent information I believe that
 
06:02:21.650 --> 06:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
will help guide Des
 
06:02:23.770 --> 06:02:23.780 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
06:02:26.810 --> 06:02:26.820 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative Howard thank
 
06:02:28.310 --> 06:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
06:02:30.830 --> 06:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
um to piggyback on to representative
 
06:02:32.930 --> 06:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
Murray's question do you think that what
 
06:02:34.970 --> 06:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
is basically the equivalent of a
 
06:02:38.270 --> 06:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
literary survey would be sufficient to
 
06:02:40.670 --> 06:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
inform the rules going forward
 
06:02:43.850 --> 06:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
I do think it is because number for two
 
06:02:47.510 --> 06:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
reasons one is that its goal
 
06:02:50.230 --> 06:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
is to come up with a site-specific
 
06:02:53.810 --> 06:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
setback criteria that's a number one
 
06:02:53.820 --> 06:02:55.310 align:start position:0%
setback criteria that's a number one
critical

06:02:55.310 --> 06:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
critical
 
06:02:58.070 --> 06:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
and then number two the fact is that it
 
06:03:01.430 --> 06:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
also will compare what New Hampshire
 
06:03:06.170 --> 06:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
currently has to other rules nearby in
 
06:03:09.070 --> 06:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
our states and and I do point to Maine's
 
06:03:11.810 --> 06:03:11.820 align:start position:0%
landfill Solid Waste rules I I think
 
06:03:14.330 --> 06:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
they're they're pretty doggone good and
 
06:03:17.150 --> 06:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
they're much more protective than New
 
06:03:17.160 --> 06:03:18.410 align:start position:0%
they're much more protective than New
Hampshire's

06:03:18.410 --> 06:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's
 
06:03:21.110 --> 06:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative dutzy thank you madam
 
06:03:22.368 --> 06:03:22.378 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
06:03:28.310 --> 06:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh did you testify on HB 1540 uh 1454
 
06:03:33.470 --> 06:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:36.230 --> 06:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:03:38.390 --> 06:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative coulon
 
06:03:40.010 --> 06:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
06:03:41.510 --> 06:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:03:43.070 --> 06:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
um so what it sounds like you're saying
 
06:03:45.410 --> 06:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
to me is that you think the language and
 
06:03:48.708 --> 06:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
this bill allows for a discovery of the
 
06:03:50.810 --> 06:03:50.820 align:start position:0%
site specific
 
06:03:53.868 --> 06:03:53.878 align:start position:0%
I do attributes and not every site is
 
06:03:56.570 --> 06:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
probably a little bit different I do
 
06:03:59.150 --> 06:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
because I think that the consultant will
 
06:04:03.190 --> 06:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
develop the data to show the diversity
 
06:04:06.128 --> 06:04:06.138 align:start position:0%
of the site-specific information
 
06:04:08.390 --> 06:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologically that would go into
 
06:04:11.990 --> 06:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
determining what sort of safe setback
 
06:04:15.170 --> 06:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
should be and I personally think a time
 
06:04:17.390 --> 06:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
of travel makes a lot of sense it's it's
 
06:04:19.730 --> 06:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
technically viable and understood and
 
06:04:21.670 --> 06:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
it's used in other places
 
06:04:24.650 --> 06:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
and so maybe they'll come back and say
 
06:04:26.990 --> 06:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
you know five years six years 10 years
 
06:04:29.990 --> 06:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
two years I don't know but I would
 
06:04:32.690 --> 06:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
assume that they will then be comparing
 
06:04:34.430 --> 06:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
whatever it is they think they're coming
 
06:04:37.128 --> 06:04:37.138 align:start position:0%
up with with what other states are doing
 
06:04:40.010 --> 06:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
also thank you
 
06:04:42.708 --> 06:04:42.718 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah I'd like to
 
06:04:44.628 --> 06:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
dig into the a little bit deeper into
 
06:04:47.510 --> 06:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
the term site-specific criteria it kind
 
06:04:50.390 --> 06:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
of rolls off the tongue easily but uh I
 
06:04:52.850 --> 06:04:52.860 align:start position:0%
think it might be easy to miss that so
 
06:04:55.310 --> 06:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
when you're saying site specific that is
 
06:04:58.788 --> 06:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
just you know one site not yet not
 
06:05:00.288 --> 06:05:00.298 align:start position:0%
another site but when you get to the
 
06:05:02.690 --> 06:05:02.700 align:start position:0%
word criteria isn't that where the
 
06:05:05.770 --> 06:05:05.780 align:start position:0%
generalization comes in that there are
 
06:05:08.510 --> 06:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh there are General patterns that you
 
06:05:12.110 --> 06:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
can use to look at every different site
 
06:05:15.288 --> 06:05:15.298 align:start position:0%
and those and and that's where you get
 
06:05:15.298 --> 06:05:17.570 align:start position:0%
and those and and that's where you get
consistency

06:05:17.570 --> 06:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
consistency
 
06:05:19.490 --> 06:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
I if I understand your question
 
06:05:19.500 --> 06:05:21.288 align:start position:0%
I if I understand your question
correctly

06:05:21.288 --> 06:05:21.298 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
06:05:23.930 --> 06:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
um there are
 
06:05:26.330 --> 06:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
every site is different
 
06:05:30.170 --> 06:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
and when one is evaluating the specifics
 
06:05:33.830 --> 06:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
of a site it's not one data point it's
 
06:05:37.970 --> 06:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
many data points of the various material
 
06:05:40.490 --> 06:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
you're looking at or it's a site with
 
06:05:42.770 --> 06:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
respect to it's set back to other
 
06:05:45.350 --> 06:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
features whether it's airports or
 
06:05:47.990 --> 06:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
schools or surface water
 
06:05:51.708 --> 06:05:51.718 align:start position:0%
so it you collect you develop and you
 
06:05:53.750 --> 06:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
collect and evaluate data specifically
 
06:05:56.750 --> 06:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
for the site in question
 
06:06:01.310 --> 06:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
but I so I guess so you get you have all
 
06:06:03.230 --> 06:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
that specific site data but there has to
 
06:06:04.850 --> 06:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
be some way to compare one site to
 
06:06:06.650 --> 06:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
another and that's where the idea of the
 
06:06:08.628 --> 06:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
criteria come in that you you need to
 
06:06:10.310 --> 06:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
you need to have some basis of
 
06:06:13.368 --> 06:06:13.378 align:start position:0%
comparison as well as the individual
 
06:06:16.070 --> 06:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
data points well the Des does require
 
06:06:18.650 --> 06:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
when one says this is where I would like
 
06:06:21.110 --> 06:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
to build my my landfill site that you
 
06:06:25.070 --> 06:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
evaluate other sites to and compare them
 
06:06:27.830 --> 06:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
so there is that comparison that's done
 
06:06:30.230 --> 06:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
in the permitting process
 
06:06:31.910 --> 06:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:06:34.368 --> 06:06:34.378 align:start position:0%
representative germano uh thank you very
 
06:06:35.930 --> 06:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair and thank you for for
 
06:06:39.350 --> 06:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question when we had the
 
06:06:41.690 --> 06:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
testimony on on HP 56 we heard from a
 
06:06:43.970 --> 06:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
number of folks who have a lot of you
 
06:06:46.070 --> 06:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
know relevant background in Hydro
 
06:06:48.230 --> 06:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
geology one of the things that I found
 
06:06:50.090 --> 06:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
confusing that we talked a bit about was
 
06:06:51.590 --> 06:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
that we heard like six different things
 
06:06:55.128 --> 06:06:55.138 align:start position:0%
from six different experts right so
 
06:06:56.930 --> 06:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about a consultant
 
06:06:59.150 --> 06:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
one consultant who comes back after an
 
06:07:01.970 --> 06:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
RFP and provides this uh you know
 
06:07:03.948 --> 06:07:03.958 align:start position:0%
recommendations with regard to a set of
 
06:07:03.958 --> 06:07:05.390 align:start position:0%
recommendations with regard to a set of
criteria

06:07:05.390 --> 06:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
06:07:08.208 --> 06:07:08.218 align:start position:0%
uh how were we with one consultant in
 
06:07:10.070 --> 06:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
that case to be assured that you know if
 
06:07:11.930 --> 06:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
we hired five other Consultants we
 
06:07:13.548 --> 06:07:13.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have five other sets of
 
06:07:16.310 --> 06:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
criteria that were recommended as you
 
06:07:18.470 --> 06:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
said we've heard testimony from lots of
 
06:07:22.070 --> 06:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
folks with lots of different views on on
 
06:07:25.610 --> 06:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
on the distance of setback travel time
 
06:07:27.590 --> 06:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
Etc so I guess it comes down to you know
 
06:07:29.270 --> 06:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
what what makes us think that if we
 
06:07:31.010 --> 06:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
hired six Consultants we wouldn't have
 
06:07:34.010 --> 06:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
six separate sets of recommendations
 
06:07:36.170 --> 06:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
I think you probably would have six
 
06:07:38.270 --> 06:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
separate recommendations but they all
 
06:07:41.270 --> 06:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
may be centering around the same thing
 
06:07:44.750 --> 06:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
which is that maybe it is travel time or
 
06:07:48.110 --> 06:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
maybe it is some other criteria that
 
06:07:50.570 --> 06:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
they all agree on
 
06:07:52.690 --> 06:07:52.700 align:start position:0%
um I I think the the greatest
 
06:07:56.390 --> 06:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
discrepancy I've heard so far with um
 
06:07:59.690 --> 06:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
among the hydrogeologists is how much do
 
06:08:03.530 --> 06:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
you rely upon the engineered safeguards
 
06:08:06.948 --> 06:08:06.958 align:start position:0%
and systems that landfills are required
 
06:08:10.430 --> 06:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
to design into their their facilities
 
06:08:16.010 --> 06:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
their operations Etc and if if one wants
 
06:08:18.830 --> 06:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
to accept that they're Fail-Safe and
 
06:08:21.708 --> 06:08:21.718 align:start position:0%
they will be for a hundred years then
 
06:08:23.750 --> 06:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
then you know maybe a hydrogeologist
 
06:08:25.430 --> 06:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
would come back and say you know maybe
 
06:08:28.010 --> 06:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
the setback is good at 300 feet or
 
06:08:32.208 --> 06:08:32.218 align:start position:0%
something but if if one does accept that
 
06:08:35.090 --> 06:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
some contamination will happen and where
 
06:08:37.368 --> 06:08:37.378 align:start position:0%
does it go and how fast does it go and
 
06:08:40.730 --> 06:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
so then what sort of of setback then is
 
06:08:43.610 --> 06:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
protective and I would suspect that that
 
06:08:46.070 --> 06:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
Des will will think about this pretty
 
06:08:48.830 --> 06:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
hard and give some guidance to the
 
06:08:52.548 --> 06:08:52.558 align:start position:0%
Consultants that they're that whatever
 
06:08:55.490 --> 06:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
they come back with needs to be quote in
 
06:08:57.410 --> 06:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
in the norm there are a lot of states
 
06:08:58.970 --> 06:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
that are dealing with landfills and
 
06:09:00.830 --> 06:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with contamination and migration
 
06:09:03.288 --> 06:09:03.298 align:start position:0%
and whatever so how are they looking at
 
06:09:05.510 --> 06:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
it versus
 
06:09:08.868 --> 06:09:08.878 align:start position:0%
um what would happen assuming the
 
06:09:11.330 --> 06:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
inevitable will happen over 100 years
 
06:09:14.030 --> 06:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
there will be releases so where does it
 
06:09:16.850 --> 06:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
go how fast does it go what can we do to
 
06:09:19.368 --> 06:09:19.378 align:start position:0%
put in our citing rules that is that
 
06:09:23.510 --> 06:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
gives us a shot at being protective
 
06:09:26.750 --> 06:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you and and so then when
 
06:09:30.110 --> 06:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
in the end doesn't it come down to If
 
06:09:32.090 --> 06:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
you're looking at several sets of
 
06:09:34.548 --> 06:09:34.558 align:start position:0%
recommendations and doesn't it in the
 
06:09:36.770 --> 06:09:36.780 align:start position:0%
end come down to a value determination
 
06:09:39.770 --> 06:09:39.780 align:start position:0%
in particular by a legislative body in
 
06:09:41.270 --> 06:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
terms of how
 
06:09:45.230 --> 06:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
long we think we need to have to make
 
06:09:46.970 --> 06:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
sure that we don't have contamination
 
06:09:49.070 --> 06:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
this goes to Senator bixby's or
 
06:09:50.270 --> 06:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
representative now I'm doing it
 
06:09:52.310 --> 06:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's uh point about
 
06:09:54.650 --> 06:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
Criterion right that that you have all
 
06:09:57.288 --> 06:09:57.298 align:start position:0%
of that data how do you determine
 
06:09:59.030 --> 06:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
how you're going to implement that
 
06:10:00.830 --> 06:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation isn't it in the end
 
06:10:04.310 --> 06:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
ultimately a value statement by a
 
06:10:06.310 --> 06:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative body that determines
 
06:10:08.510 --> 06:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
which set of recommendations you're
 
06:10:09.948 --> 06:10:09.958 align:start position:0%
going to apply if you're going to be
 
06:10:13.010 --> 06:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
more airing on the side of caution or
 
06:10:13.020 --> 06:10:15.708 align:start position:0%
more airing on the side of caution or
less

06:10:15.708 --> 06:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:19.970 --> 06:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:22.970 --> 06:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
possibilities because
 
06:10:26.208 --> 06:10:26.218 align:start position:0%
you know how protective of all of the
 
06:10:28.250 --> 06:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
stakeholders do you want to be it costs
 
06:10:31.970 --> 06:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
a lot of money to deal with failures and
 
06:10:34.910 --> 06:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
and we don't cavalierly want to go and
 
06:10:36.770 --> 06:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
and head in that direction so that we're
 
06:10:39.650 --> 06:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
always spending money on failures and
 
06:10:41.510 --> 06:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
and but you also don't want to say well
 
06:10:43.970 --> 06:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
I guess we won't have any more landfills
 
06:10:45.948 --> 06:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
ever for the next thousand years because
 
06:10:47.270 --> 06:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's probably not going to actually
 
06:10:50.270 --> 06:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
work either so you have a very
 
06:10:52.810 --> 06:10:52.820 align:start position:0%
interesting job in balancing
 
06:10:56.390 --> 06:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
your requirements yeah I do and when the
 
06:10:58.910 --> 06:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
failure is pfas contamination to me it's
 
06:11:00.830 --> 06:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
clear which side we should lean toward
 
06:11:02.150 --> 06:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
but thank you very much for your your
 
06:11:05.628 --> 06:11:05.638 align:start position:0%
answer representative Bixby yeah so um
 
06:11:10.570 --> 06:11:10.580 align:start position:0%
I'm uh your comments on uh how different
 
06:11:12.948 --> 06:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologists and Consultants might
 
06:11:14.750 --> 06:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
come up with slightly different answers
 
06:11:16.910 --> 06:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
but you can if you look at all of them
 
06:11:18.530 --> 06:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
together then you might get some better
 
06:11:21.830 --> 06:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
ideas uh makes me think about uh in
 
06:11:24.048 --> 06:11:24.058 align:start position:0%
section five uh
 
06:11:26.090 --> 06:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
uh part one
 
06:11:27.948 --> 06:11:27.958 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Environmental
 
06:11:29.750 --> 06:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
Services shall contract with one or more
 
06:11:31.190 --> 06:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
qualified consulting firms for
 
06:11:33.708 --> 06:11:33.718 align:start position:0%
individuals to perform an assessment do
 
06:11:35.330 --> 06:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
you think it might make sense to require
 
06:11:43.868 --> 06:11:43.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:47.810 --> 06:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
it's going to if you did something like
 
06:11:50.208 --> 06:11:50.218 align:start position:0%
that it's going to take longer it's
 
06:11:51.890 --> 06:11:51.900 align:start position:0%
going to draw out the process it's going
 
06:11:53.510 --> 06:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
to create
 
06:11:53.520 --> 06:11:54.948 align:start position:0%
to create
um

06:11:54.948 --> 06:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:57.170 --> 06:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
compromising within the department with
 
06:12:00.708 --> 06:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
the two Consultants whatever you
 
06:12:02.628 --> 06:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
frankly I think you can do just fine
 
06:12:05.270 --> 06:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
with one okay thank you just choosing
 
06:12:07.430 --> 06:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
choosing a good one that that doesn't
 
06:12:09.890 --> 06:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
have a dog in the fight all right thank
 
06:12:11.868 --> 06:12:11.878 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
06:12:16.128 --> 06:12:16.138 align:start position:0%
appreciate your uh your testimony
 
06:12:16.138 --> 06:12:17.750 align:start position:0%
appreciate your uh your testimony
and

06:12:17.750 --> 06:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:12:21.730 --> 06:12:21.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:23.930 --> 06:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:12:27.708 --> 06:12:27.718 align:start position:0%
um I'll call now Kirsten Coke
 
06:12:29.750 --> 06:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
is it Coke or Koch
 
06:12:31.850 --> 06:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
touch I'm sorry
 
06:12:34.548 --> 06:12:34.558 align:start position:0%
Kirsten Koch
 
06:12:34.558 --> 06:12:37.390 align:start position:0%
Kirsten Koch
foreign

06:12:37.390 --> 06:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:40.128 --> 06:12:40.138 align:start position:0%
Madam chair Representatives um it's been
 
06:12:41.628 --> 06:12:41.638 align:start position:0%
a long day I know so I will be very
 
06:12:44.390 --> 06:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
brief my name is Kirsten Koch I'm
 
06:12:45.770 --> 06:12:45.780 align:start position:0%
director of public policy for the
 
06:12:47.090 --> 06:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association
 
06:12:49.128 --> 06:12:49.138 align:start position:0%
Statewide Chamber of Commerce also known
 
06:12:52.368 --> 06:12:52.378 align:start position:0%
as Bia and I come before you today to
 
06:12:56.330 --> 06:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
register Bia support for Senate bill 61.
 
06:12:58.670 --> 06:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
we support this bill as a vehicle for
 
06:13:00.470 --> 06:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
modernizing landfill permitting because
 
06:13:02.330 --> 06:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
we believe it requires scientific
 
06:13:04.610 --> 06:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
studies to be done and subsequently
 
06:13:07.490 --> 06:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
update rules and regulations based on
 
06:13:09.288 --> 06:13:09.298 align:start position:0%
the scientific data from those studies
 
06:13:11.990 --> 06:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's long been a policy priority for the
 
06:13:14.030 --> 06:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association to
 
06:13:16.610 --> 06:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
support efforts to create science-based
 
06:13:18.830 --> 06:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
rules or legislation and we think this
 
06:13:21.590 --> 06:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
does exactly that we believe this bill
 
06:13:23.150 --> 06:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
is the best way to go for updating
 
06:13:25.128 --> 06:13:25.138 align:start position:0%
landfill permitting because we see it as
 
06:13:28.190 --> 06:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
fair and scientifically accurate in the
 
06:13:30.890 --> 06:13:30.900 align:start position:0%
senate senate Bill 61 received a support
 
06:13:34.250 --> 06:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
from a broad variety of folks from
 
06:13:36.288 --> 06:13:36.298 align:start position:0%
environmental experts industry leaders
 
06:13:38.590 --> 06:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
and environmental activists
 
06:13:41.990 --> 06:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
as Senator Waters explained earlier
 
06:13:45.048 --> 06:13:45.058 align:start position:0%
there's clearly a bipartisan desire to
 
06:13:47.150 --> 06:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
create a solution here and we hope to
 
06:13:49.190 --> 06:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
see that come forward we strongly
 
06:13:51.410 --> 06:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
support Senate Bill 61 and we believe
 
06:13:53.030 --> 06:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
this bill provides a fair solution
 
06:13:55.070 --> 06:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
accurately updating landfill permitting
 
06:13:57.170 --> 06:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
in conclusion we asked the committee to
 
06:14:00.350 --> 06:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
please pass Senate Bill 61. thank you
 
06:14:01.788 --> 06:14:01.798 align:start position:0%
for your consideration I'd be happy to
 
06:14:04.670 --> 06:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions
 
06:14:07.128 --> 06:14:07.138 align:start position:0%
Miss coach do you have a written
 
06:14:09.048 --> 06:14:09.058 align:start position:0%
testimony at all to share with us I can
 
06:14:11.030 --> 06:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
provide it okay thank you that's
 
06:14:11.040 --> 06:14:15.788 align:start position:0%
provide it okay thank you that's
appreciated

06:14:15.788 --> 06:14:15.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:19.368 --> 06:14:19.378 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby uh does the Bia
 
06:14:21.470 --> 06:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
have a position
 
06:14:25.490 --> 06:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
um in terms of uh whether the
 
06:14:29.208 --> 06:14:29.218 align:start position:0%
um if the 24 month deadline is not met
 
06:14:32.810 --> 06:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
whether it should revert to Old rules
 
06:14:35.030 --> 06:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:14:35.040 --> 06:14:36.350 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

06:14:36.350 --> 06:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:38.690 --> 06:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
we came prepared just to discuss the
 
06:14:40.970 --> 06:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
bill as is and not amendments but
 
06:14:43.128 --> 06:14:43.138 align:start position:0%
ultimately you know we support this bill
 
06:14:44.690 --> 06:14:44.700 align:start position:0%
because we want to see these changes
 
06:14:47.868 --> 06:14:47.878 align:start position:0%
come forward within the 24 months we see
 
06:14:49.368 --> 06:14:49.378 align:start position:0%
that provision as another additional
 
06:14:51.288 --> 06:14:51.298 align:start position:0%
Safeguard ultimately it's a policy
 
06:14:53.330 --> 06:14:53.340 align:start position:0%
decision for the committee to bake
 
06:14:54.830 --> 06:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:14:58.368 --> 06:14:58.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:00.230 --> 06:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
06:15:02.810 --> 06:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
testimony this afternoon thank you
 
06:15:15.650 --> 06:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:18.230 --> 06:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
06:15:18.240 --> 06:15:21.288 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
foreign

06:15:21.288 --> 06:15:21.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:23.750 --> 06:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
sorry about that good afternoon I'm
 
06:15:26.270 --> 06:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
Nikki delude Roy I am a professional
 
06:15:28.070 --> 06:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
geologist licensed in the state of New
 
06:15:30.590 --> 06:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am also vice president of a
 
06:15:32.150 --> 06:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
company named verdantis we are an
 
06:15:34.670 --> 06:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
environmental and engineering firm with
 
06:15:36.470 --> 06:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
an office here in Manchester New
 
06:15:39.970 --> 06:15:39.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we have offices in about
 
06:15:43.810 --> 06:15:43.820 align:start position:0%
26 States currently and practice
 
06:15:46.670 --> 06:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
environmental and Engineering across all
 
06:15:48.708 --> 06:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
of those States
 
06:15:51.048 --> 06:15:51.058 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you all hearing my
 
06:15:53.330 --> 06:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
testimony as you all probably know I've
 
06:15:54.948 --> 06:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
reviewed and commented on bills on the
 
06:15:57.170 --> 06:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
same topic in this and in previous
 
06:15:59.990 --> 06:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
legislative sessions and so I am here
 
06:16:03.170 --> 06:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
today in support of SB 61
 
06:16:05.990 --> 06:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
because I believe that this proposed
 
06:16:08.570 --> 06:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
Bill really ultimately goes back to the
 
06:16:11.930 --> 06:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
expertise that is at DES with regards to
 
06:16:14.990 --> 06:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
making the appropriate sets of rules for
 
06:16:17.390 --> 06:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
that reflect the geology and the setting
 
06:16:20.270 --> 06:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
and the stakeholders in the state
 
06:16:23.030 --> 06:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'll um I'll be brief today because I
 
06:16:24.530 --> 06:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
think Muriel and others who have
 
06:16:26.750 --> 06:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
testified earlier this afternoon have
 
06:16:29.510 --> 06:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
spoken to all of the complexities around
 
06:16:31.430 --> 06:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
the issue of citing landfills in the
 
06:16:31.440 --> 06:16:32.810 align:start position:0%
the issue of citing landfills in the
state

06:16:32.810 --> 06:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:16:34.430 --> 06:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
for example there were a number of
 
06:16:36.770 --> 06:16:36.780 align:start position:0%
questions regarding the definition of an
 
06:16:36.780 --> 06:16:37.930 align:start position:0%
questions regarding the definition of an
aquifer

06:16:37.930 --> 06:16:37.940 align:start position:0%
aquifer
 
06:16:41.270 --> 06:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
it really just speaks to how complex the
 
06:16:44.090 --> 06:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
geology is here and how important it is
 
06:16:47.150 --> 06:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
that the legislature basically Direct
 
06:16:49.970 --> 06:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
Des to go into the rulemaking process
 
06:16:53.570 --> 06:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
and think be thoughtful about the the
 
06:16:55.430 --> 06:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
update to the solid waste regulations
 
06:16:58.430 --> 06:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
and specifically to the sighting regs
 
06:17:02.090 --> 06:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to emphasize that by
 
06:17:04.788 --> 06:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
through SB 61 and through the
 
06:17:07.010 --> 06:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
investigation or the study that has been
 
06:17:09.590 --> 06:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
referenced and discussed previously this
 
06:17:12.590 --> 06:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon There's an opportunity for the
 
06:17:14.810 --> 06:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
best science across the country to be
 
06:17:17.350 --> 06:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
evaluated brought forward
 
06:17:20.690 --> 06:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
recommended to Des put into context with
 
06:17:23.030 --> 06:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
the geology here in the state and for
 
06:17:25.670 --> 06:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately for Des to incorporate that
 
06:17:29.448 --> 06:17:29.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:29.458 --> 06:17:30.170 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:17:30.170 --> 06:17:30.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:33.410 --> 06:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
so I will just end I guess my testimony
 
06:17:35.448 --> 06:17:35.458 align:start position:0%
here today just to say how supportive I
 
06:17:39.230 --> 06:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
am of sb61 because ultimately it brings
 
06:17:42.288 --> 06:17:42.298 align:start position:0%
into the the consideration of practice
 
06:17:44.708 --> 06:17:44.718 align:start position:0%
the state of practice across the country
 
06:17:47.810 --> 06:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
as well as the site-specific geology in
 
06:17:50.090 --> 06:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
the state and then It ultimately relies
 
06:17:52.128 --> 06:17:52.138 align:start position:0%
on the experts at DES to go through the
 
06:17:54.048 --> 06:17:54.058 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process that they have
 
06:17:55.910 --> 06:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
in-house so thank you for consideration
 
06:17:58.190 --> 06:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
my comments
 
06:18:00.048 --> 06:18:00.058 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for
 
06:18:02.690 --> 06:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
06:18:05.208 --> 06:18:05.218 align:start position:0%
um is it is oh thank you madam chair and
 
06:18:07.010 --> 06:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
06:18:10.548 --> 06:18:10.558 align:start position:0%
um is verdantis also uh um under
 
06:18:12.350 --> 06:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
contract with the state we are not
 
06:18:17.570 --> 06:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:17.580 --> 06:18:18.948 align:start position:0%
 
okay

any other questions
 
06:18:22.910 --> 06:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
06:18:25.930 --> 06:18:25.940 align:start position:0%
that was my last pink card
 
06:18:29.868 --> 06:18:29.878 align:start position:0%
so if anyone else would like to make
 
06:18:32.690 --> 06:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
comments or testimony
 
06:18:35.150 --> 06:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
please come up to the microphone fill
 
06:18:36.410 --> 06:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
out a pink card
 
06:18:38.810 --> 06:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
you know okay
 
06:18:38.820 --> 06:18:40.310 align:start position:0%
you know okay
um

um
 
06:18:43.128 --> 06:18:43.138 align:start position:0%
the online portal
 
06:18:48.128 --> 06:18:48.138 align:start position:0%
has 47 people in support of this bill 81
 
06:18:51.948 --> 06:18:51.958 align:start position:0%
opposed and five neutral
 
06:18:55.850 --> 06:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
in our blue sheet has four people in
 
06:19:02.590 --> 06:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
favor and one person opposed to SB 61.
 
06:19:05.330 --> 06:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:19:10.128 --> 06:19:10.138 align:start position:0%
I guess we are at the end of our our uh
 
06:19:12.288 --> 06:19:12.298 align:start position:0%
hearing for this today
 
06:19:14.510 --> 06:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
I want to thank everybody for their
 
06:19:16.910 --> 06:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
patience and their fortitude for making
 
06:19:18.110 --> 06:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
it this far
 
06:19:20.270 --> 06:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
especially our committee members for
 
06:19:23.090 --> 06:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
sitting so patiently and answering I
 
06:19:25.310 --> 06:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
mean uh asking some very very good
 
06:19:26.930 --> 06:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
questions along the way
 
06:19:29.448 --> 06:19:29.458 align:start position:0%
so I am going to close this hearing on
 
06:19:33.048 --> 06:19:33.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:34.368 --> 06:19:34.378 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:19:37.250 --> 06:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
um so my intention here is now that
 
06:19:38.750 --> 06:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
we've heard all the bills that we've
 
06:19:40.430 --> 06:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
heard today
 
06:19:40.440 --> 06:19:41.770 align:start position:0%
heard today
um

06:19:41.770 --> 06:19:41.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:45.770 --> 06:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
next week we are scheduled on Tuesday to
 
06:19:48.350 --> 06:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
have a tour of unh
 
06:19:52.910 --> 06:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:00.470 --> 06:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:00.480 --> 06:20:02.270 align:start position:0%
 
uction okay

06:20:02.270 --> 06:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
uction okay
 
06:20:02.280 --> 06:20:03.530 align:start position:0%
uction okay
okay

06:20:03.530 --> 06:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:20:03.540 --> 06:20:05.288 align:start position:0%
okay
and

06:20:05.288 --> 06:20:05.298 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:20:08.990 --> 06:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to include the um
 
06:20:13.090 --> 06:20:13.100 align:start position:0%
uh agricultural uh research station
 
06:20:15.230 --> 06:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
06:20:16.970 --> 06:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
um some of the things that we're going
 
06:20:18.770 --> 06:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
to be seeing
 
06:20:23.208 --> 06:20:23.218 align:start position:0%
um are so uh we're going to hear from uh
 
06:20:24.770 --> 06:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
the director of the Agricultural
 
06:20:26.330 --> 06:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
research station
 
06:20:29.208 --> 06:20:29.218 align:start position:0%
um who if uh also was the one who gave
 
06:20:32.030 --> 06:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
us the greenhouse tour last month uh and
 
06:20:34.190 --> 06:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh that's Anton Beckerman and we're
 
06:20:37.310 --> 06:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
going to hear from uh the
 
06:20:39.770 --> 06:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
um Cooperative Extension we're going to
 
06:20:42.830 --> 06:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
see the research Farms out at Woodman
 
06:20:45.048 --> 06:20:45.058 align:start position:0%
Farm we're going to see the organic
 
06:20:47.090 --> 06:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
Dairy we're going to hear from a
 
06:20:49.190 --> 06:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
researcher who is working on water
 
06:20:53.390 --> 06:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
quality with uh um with particular
 
06:20:56.750 --> 06:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
attention to contaminants like pfas uh
 
06:20:56.760 --> 06:20:58.128 align:start position:0%
attention to contaminants like pfas uh
and

06:20:58.128 --> 06:20:58.138 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:21:00.470 --> 06:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
um I think we might have a couple there
 
06:21:02.330 --> 06:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
might be a couple there there's a very
 
06:21:04.730 --> 06:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
full day that's going to be presented to
 
06:21:06.288 --> 06:21:06.298 align:start position:0%
us and we're going to get a lot of
 
06:21:08.570 --> 06:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
interesting information
 
06:21:11.330 --> 06:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
I will be sending out to the committee
 
06:21:13.670 --> 06:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
um I think we've already gotten it but
 
06:21:17.150 --> 06:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
I'll resend it the agenda for that you
 
06:21:19.430 --> 06:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
had a proposed agenda yeah there was a
 
06:21:22.788 --> 06:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
there was a um there was a draft agenda
 
06:21:24.948 --> 06:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
which will probably be pretty close to
 
06:21:27.530 --> 06:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
the whole thing and so if we I can touch
 
06:21:31.190 --> 06:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
base with Campbell Valley and uh see if
 
06:21:33.590 --> 06:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
we can get the uh a final version the
 
06:21:35.330 --> 06:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
final final version of the agenda and
 
06:21:36.890 --> 06:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
then we'll share it with everybody and
 
06:21:39.830 --> 06:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
give dress code dress code
 
06:21:41.930 --> 06:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
um um wear shoes you don't mind getting
 
06:21:41.940 --> 06:21:45.830 align:start position:0%
um um wear shoes you don't mind getting
muddy

06:21:45.830 --> 06:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:48.350 --> 06:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
okay so we have uh next week we've got
 
06:21:50.090 --> 06:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
this tour
 
06:21:54.788 --> 06:21:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:00.190 --> 06:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
the 9th May 9th my plan is to
 
06:22:02.868 --> 06:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
exec most of the bills that we heard
 
06:22:06.788 --> 06:22:06.798 align:start position:0%
today and we may have a work session
 
06:22:12.288 --> 06:22:12.298 align:start position:0%
on maybe SB 61 or any of the other ones
 
06:22:14.750 --> 06:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
that may need it
 
06:22:14.760 --> 06:22:15.470 align:start position:0%
that may need it
um

06:22:15.470 --> 06:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:17.868 --> 06:22:17.878 align:start position:0%
and if we have any kind of amendments
 
06:22:20.448 --> 06:22:20.458 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss it then and then we'll
 
06:22:22.788 --> 06:22:22.798 align:start position:0%
have to figure out whether later in the
 
06:22:25.548 --> 06:22:25.558 align:start position:0%
day not it wouldn't be later in the day
 
06:22:26.990 --> 06:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
because we would have some sort of
 
06:22:29.628 --> 06:22:29.638 align:start position:0%
amendments unless we would discuss the
 
06:22:31.850 --> 06:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
Amendments that morning and then execut
 
06:22:34.250 --> 06:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon I think what would make
 
06:22:36.650 --> 06:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
sense is that we should plan on having a
 
06:22:38.030 --> 06:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
work session in the morning where we
 
06:22:41.270 --> 06:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
could discuss any amendments and uh we
 
06:22:43.788 --> 06:22:43.798 align:start position:0%
can also make sure that those amendments
 
06:22:45.530 --> 06:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
go out to people in advance so they have
 
06:22:47.770 --> 06:22:47.780 align:start position:0%
a good chance chance to think about them
 
06:22:53.090 --> 06:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh and uh if there are not if if we can
 
06:22:56.090 --> 06:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
uh settle if we agree on the amendments
 
06:22:58.490 --> 06:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
in that work session then we can it
 
06:23:00.590 --> 06:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
should be straightforward to exec in the
 
06:23:00.600 --> 06:23:01.510 align:start position:0%
should be straightforward to exec in the
afternoon

06:23:01.510 --> 06:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
06:23:05.570 --> 06:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh and I think we can I would guess that
 
06:23:05.580 --> 06:23:06.890 align:start position:0%
uh and I think we can I would guess that
with

06:23:06.890 --> 06:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:23:10.490 --> 06:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
the exception of possibly one bill we'd
 
06:23:13.730 --> 06:23:13.740 align:start position:0%
be able to exec everything yeah
 
06:23:16.788 --> 06:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's kind of the plan
 
06:23:18.650 --> 06:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:23:20.270 --> 06:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know if anybody else has any
 
06:23:21.830 --> 06:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
questions about anything you've heard
 
06:23:23.390 --> 06:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
today or
 
06:23:26.090 --> 06:23:26.100 align:start position:0%

06:23:26.100 --> 06:23:27.708 align:start position:0%
