00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
okay now that it's 10 o'clock Apple time
 
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
we can get underway and whoever would
 
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
like to come
 
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
I would make a public announcement that
 
00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we're canceling our work
 
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
session I would imagine most of you were
 
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
okay welcome commissioner good morning
 
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
for the record Frank gadle blue
 
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Education
 
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
Tammy Vaillancourt CFO
 
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 align:start position:0%
Caitlin Davis director
 
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
and so I just wanted to see if anybody
 
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
had any questions about the reading
 
00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.490 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
um so good morning I mean I'm here to
 
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
kind of answer questions that you may
 
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
have relative to the budget and I can
 
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
walk through specific programs I have
 
00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
this sheet right here
 
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
which we were provided by Mickey or I
 
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
have my hb2 language as well like what
 
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
is the easiest way for me to facilitate
 
00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
walking through this with when we walk
 
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
through using this that document okay
 
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.510 align:start position:0%
through using this that document okay
yeah

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 align:start position:0%
great so then we'll start
 
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
um it is
 
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
going down so it says page 28.
 
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the left-hand column the first 28
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
there section 62 Department of Education
 
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 align:start position:0%
computer science and stem administrator
 
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
then the next line 28 63 Department of
 
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
Education computer science educator
 
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
program and then Pages 29 and 30 section
 
00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 align:start position:0%
64 and 65 Department of Education
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
computer science Appropriations and so
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
those I'm going to talk about those
 
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
three because they have some
 
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
interconnectivity in terms of coming
 
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.529 align:start position:0%
interconnectivity in terms of coming
together

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
um and really the first item on there
 
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
the computer science stem administrator
 
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
is my understanding and administrative
 
00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 align:start position:0%
position in hb2 that was added in the
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
governor's budget to help us administer
 
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
the two subsequent programs so we can
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
talk to that
 
00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 align:start position:0%
um the only uh difficulty with that is
 
00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 align:start position:0%
is we don't see an appropriation for
 
00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 align:start position:0%
that so while there's a
 
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
um you know computer science stem
 
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
administrator position that was included
 
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
to administer the programs that are
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
being implemented there was not funding
 
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
associated with that so if we decide to
 
00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
go forward with those that programming
 
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
it probably would need some
 
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
Administration to take place
 
00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
but then the next item that I will point
 
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
out is computer science educator program
 
00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 align:start position:0%
and this is a program to encourage
 
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
current Educators so this would be
 
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
individuals who currently hold a teacher
 
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
certificate in the state of New
 
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.370 align:start position:0%
certificate in the state of New
Hampshire

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
to add a certificate or a an endorsement
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
to their certificate in the computer
 
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
science area and so the goal there is to
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
increase the number of computer science
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
Educators that we have in the state to
 
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
make that more ubiquitous in our school
 
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
systems we do run a number of computer
 
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
science classes we've got a lot of
 
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
Robotics programming in the state and so
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
this is a program that would you know
 
00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
allow those Educators to convert over
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
and essentially what we would probably
 
00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
do is Target a thousand Educators and we
 
00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:07.139 align:start position:0%
would provide stipends of 500 each for
 
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
those Educators to become to attain that
 
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
certification okay Mary actually I like
 
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
that idea um
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
this area
 
00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:21.539 align:start position:0%
for many Educators is still a mystery
 
00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:24.419 align:start position:0%
and we saw that when we had covered and
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
the re the difficulty with zoom many of
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
them had to do a lot
 
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
how do you see this happening
 
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
um will you will their training be
 
00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:38.699 align:start position:0%
covered and step-ended I believe you
 
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
said correct um so what do you think
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
it'll look like because currently
 
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
quite frankly the current programs
 
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:47.660 align:start position:0%
usually in most schools are pretty dry
 
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
and they're not in context they're not
 
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
part of an application but I in truth
 
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
I've been away from schools for a while
 
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
so I may be all off but in my experience
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
they haven't been very exciting and the
 
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
exciting stuff is going on so tell me
 
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
about that I can't tell you about that
 
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
so first of all I'd like to just kind of
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
pull apart the um kind of what you were
 
00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
describing there relative to what this
 
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
is so this is
 
00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
um not for program so much as it is
 
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
getting the certifications for the
 
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.089 align:start position:0%
getting the certifications for the
Educators

00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:20.099 align:start position:0%
Educators
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I will mention is
 
00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:25.139 align:start position:0%
with our Arps or funds and and so this
 
00:08:26.809 --> 00:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
is specifically targeted at computer
 
00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:30.419 align:start position:0%
science Educators we did provide two
 
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars of funding and worked
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
with Granite State College for all of
 
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
our Educators to be able to take a class
 
00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
that would help them with the remote
 
00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959 align:start position:0%
instruction so it taught them you know
 
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
how to use canvas how to design an
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
online class and how to implement online
 
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:45.300 align:start position:0%
class so that I'm going to separate that
 
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:47.540 align:start position:0%
this is specifically associated with
 
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
allowing currently certified Educators
 
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
to add a computer certification so that
 
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
it's there are more opportunities for
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
students across the state vis-a-vis
 
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
those instructors and the way that that
 
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:02.700 align:start position:0%
would be administered is through a
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
stipend that we would offer to the
 
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
Educators who are interested in pursuing
 
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
that career opportunity so thank you
 
00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
question I think Mr chair and thank you
 
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking the questions so
 
00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand that this
 
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
500 would be the stipend for the educate
 
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
educator themselves this is not the
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for their training or
 
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
travel or testing expenses is it just
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
the you know compensation for taking on
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
the work and then those other expenses
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
will be handled by the district or by
 
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
whom no actually the inverse of that so
 
00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:40.019 align:start position:0%
what this would be would be the 500 of
 
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
the cost for the Educators to attend the
 
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
courses or the programs to be able to
 
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
acquire the knowledge and the capability
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
containing the certification right this
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
is to allow them to become certified
 
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
thank you not for programming so
 
00:09:59.690 --> 00:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
and then just I'm throwing I'm moving
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
forward just to keep moving forward but
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
we can come back to it but they all kind
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
of come together so that's what I wanted
 
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
to well I'm going to keep going forward
 
00:10:08.329 --> 00:10:08.339 align:start position:0%
then you'll see there's an addition uh
 
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
the four million dollar appropriation
 
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
um it's actually a five million dollar
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
in total but uh is associated with
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
um expanding the availability of
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
computer science teachers in the system
 
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
by going outside of the traditional
 
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
certified Educators if you recall the
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
first program was about taking
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
individuals who already hold an educator
 
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
certification and allowing them to add
 
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
the certificate for the endorsement for
 
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
computer science educator this is really
 
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
to bring individuals off of the
 
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
sidelines we imagine that there may be
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
some retired individuals in the state
 
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
who have a lot of experience whether
 
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
it's in math or computer science and
 
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
allowing them to gain certification that
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
would take there's two ways that that
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
would happen and actually they you have
 
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
to kind of follow through both of those
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
but one would would be we would identify
 
00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:00.860 align:start position:0%
a current computer
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
certifications industry recognized
 
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
credentials that individuals hold
 
00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:07.019 align:start position:0%
whether it's like a Cisco license or a
 
00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:10.019 align:start position:0%
programming license from a vendor right
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
so these are individuals who are
 
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
credentialed in the commercial world and
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
we would recognize those credentials
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
which would allow them to become a
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
certified teacher and then this funding
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
stream would allow them to add the
 
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
pedagogical capability to that
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
certification so that they would be able
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
to function as a certified teacher in
 
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
Microsoft could be Microsoft would be
 
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
one that we would probably have I don't
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
know if we might not
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
you know credential someone who holds
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
like a an office certification like word
 
00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:40.019 align:start position:0%
or something like that but more of the
 
00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:42.779 align:start position:0%
serious certifications yes
 
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
thank you so this is essentially the
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
part where you are going and finding the
 
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
for the lack of the better word Geeks
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
and training them to be teachers that's
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
correct well I will be and that term is
 
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
an affectionate term term of effect I am
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
yes it is a self-inflicted term I was a
 
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
certified trainer for a while I only get
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
to say because I'm one of them but my
 
00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:09.899 align:start position:0%
concern there and I just want to you
 
00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:12.779 align:start position:0%
know state it for the record is that it
 
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
is actually it is
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
most of the time it is easier to take
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
somebody who's already a teacher and
 
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
teach them the computer skills they need
 
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
than it is to take a computer expert and
 
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
show them how to become a teacher those
 
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
skills are harder to acquire and you
 
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
have a much lower percentage of people
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
that can make the transition than the
 
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
other way around so just to share
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
because I've been in that field for over
 
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
10 years professionally and one of the
 
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
reasons why I was making the big bucks
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
was that I was one of the people who was
 
00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
both very technically capable and could
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
teach but is the second part that's
 
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
harder to find so you may find more
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
success taking the existing teachers and
 
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
making them more proficient in computers
 
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.220 align:start position:0%
and the other way around but those are
 
00:12:58.009 --> 00:12:58.019 align:start position:0%
very much worth exploring and when they
 
00:12:59.690 --> 00:12:59.700 align:start position:0%
work they work spectacularly well things
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
and so you can kind of see how these two
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
programs are complementary in that sense
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
one is taking the existing Educators and
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
giving them the computer science skills
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
and the other is pulling people off of
 
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
the sideline and making them teachers so
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
question yeah I don't know if I
 
00:13:14.569 --> 00:13:14.579 align:start position:0%
misunderstood um the people that you'd
 
00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
be bringing in the computer science
 
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
professionals did you say that they were
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
certified already coming into the
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
program correct so what would happen but
 
00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
not just that they were certified in
 
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
whatever they're doing it's just it
 
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
strikes me that the people I know who
 
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
are retired in computer science have
 
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
never have had a credential and these
 
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
are the superstars in the field who are
 
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
meaning that they are they meaning their
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
Silicon Valley Silicon Valley well Geeks
 
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
or whatever or high uh performers right
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
so I mean and so I'm trying to
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
understand the question a little bit
 
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
because it might be helpful for me as we
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
kind of craft the program but the is the
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
issue that those individuals don't hold
 
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:56.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you Mr chairman oh
 
00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here at Ronald
 
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.490 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here at Ronald
commissioner

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.150 align:start position:0%
commissioner
um

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
how many different certifications do you
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
have now uh in specialties
 
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
you know like uh K is a K-8 uh High
 
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
interesting thank you question and I can
 
00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:23.339 align:start position:0%
get the exact number for you but I don't
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
know what's on my head you know
 
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
so these would these individuals those
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
industry recognize sort of
 
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
certifications would allow them to
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
attain the computer science
 
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
certification not we wouldn't create a
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
new certification for you're an educator
 
00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:41.220 align:start position:0%
of Cisco you're an educator of Oracle or
 
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr Richard just to
 
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
quickly follow up on representative
 
00:14:48.769 --> 00:14:48.779 align:start position:0%
Murray's comment it is a very valid
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
point there are people who get lots of
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
certifications and there are people who
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
have already established themselves and
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
don't need the certifications because
 
00:14:57.769 --> 00:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
their work experience and achievements
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
prove it so I would urge the department
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
to be flexible when they try to attract
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
technical professionals and allow for
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
both Avenues
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
because proven capability and
 
00:15:11.569 --> 00:15:11.579 align:start position:0%
performance is just as valuable if not
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
more valuable than a technical
 
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
certification so you know just like not
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
asking people to have a college degree
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
but just show they can do the job
 
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
if you guys can be flexible on deciding
 
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
who can do the job every one of those
 
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
methods work and I think you should open
 
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
all of them okay you know thank you I
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
mean in one way we might be able to
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
pursue that is really working with
 
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
perhaps Granite State College that has a
 
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
program where they recognize experience
 
00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:38.339 align:start position:0%
and they're able to award certifications
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
based on that experience so we don't
 
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
have to build that infrastructure we
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
would leverage that infrastructure sure
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
are you ready to move on these items
 
00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
let's let's start keep going oh you're
 
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.569 --> 00:16:02.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
how do you plan to measure the outcome
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
of this program
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
so it would be the number of uh computer
 
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
of certified computer science Educators
 
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
that we have in our schools I was
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
thinking one level down the road how do
 
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
you measure that it makes an impact in
 
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
uh you know the outcomes for our
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
children I mean obviously in the short
 
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
term you'd you know be able to see the
 
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839 align:start position:0%
number of people you are able to bring
 
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
in but down the road how do we
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
prove to you know the people we're
 
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
asking for the money from that this
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
money was well spent and improve the
 
00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579 align:start position:0%
outcomes for our kids and so we don't
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
have a computer science assessment so we
 
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
don't have a mechanism that would be
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
able to measure that and I think what
 
00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:43.220 align:start position:0%
you'd find is that the computer science
 
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:45.180 align:start position:0%
particularly as you look forward in
 
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
terms of the instructional it's going to
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
be much more integrated in terms of in
 
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
other words like it's not going to be
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
siled like okay here's computer science
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
class and how many students are
 
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
participating it that really needs to be
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
integrated into
 
00:16:59.810 --> 00:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
um you know the science curriculum and
 
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
all kinds of curriculum quite frankly so
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we have a mechanism
 
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339 align:start position:0%
for measuring that it would be good if
 
00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:07.579 align:start position:0%
you'd you know over time consider
 
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
developing some framework I know it's
 
00:17:11.929 --> 00:17:11.939 align:start position:0%
not for today you are still a few steps
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
away from there but I would argue that
 
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day these types of
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
large Investments do
 
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
require us to look down the road and say
 
00:17:23.449 --> 00:17:23.459 align:start position:0%
10 years from now yeah this worked
 
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
already this is how we can show
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
so so the initial metrics that we've
 
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
considered is the number of computer
 
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
science Educators yeah thank you
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
taking my question is this short term
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
okay this is a one-time thing and source
 
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
of funds
 
00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.270 align:start position:0%
of funds
um

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
yeah General funds oh thank you
 
00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.190 align:start position:0%
yeah General funds oh thank you
yes

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
I think this might be 23 laps actually
 
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.370 align:start position:0%
I think this might be 23 laps actually
yeah

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
General funds Labs right uh before
 
00:17:57.049 --> 00:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
moving on to the on these sections two
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
things that I'm just noticing the
 
00:17:59.930 --> 00:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
commissioner talked about there's no
 
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
funding Associated to this new
 
00:18:03.169 --> 00:18:03.179 align:start position:0%
administrator position that was
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
established so we haven't received any
 
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
estimates or requests relative to that I
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
don't do have a number
 
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:11.220 align:start position:0%
I know but we can get that for you
 
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
so so that that position is established
 
00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2 Section 62 but there's
 
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
no funding for it right so right now we
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
would have an amendment that would
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
establish the funding as a separate
 
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
section or put it in house bill one or
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
put it in as an appropriation here
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
there's two ways to do it but we just we
 
00:18:30.049 --> 00:18:30.059 align:start position:0%
would need those numbers if you wanted
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
to fund that position as a committee uh
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
so just putting that
 
00:18:39.169 --> 00:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
can we move on the item and then
 
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
okay I just wanted to make sure the
 
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
committee was aware that that would have
 
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
to happen and we'll get that information
 
00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:45.539 align:start position:0%
but we're looking at something around
 
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:47.220 align:start position:0%
150 Grand
 
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
probably yes question could we just take
 
00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:52.460 align:start position:0%
it out of the um
 
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
4.955 you can and that way we give you
 
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
authority to do that so it's coming out
 
00:19:00.409 --> 00:19:00.419 align:start position:0%
it's already in there if you wanted to
 
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
repurpose some of the appropriation
 
00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
because there's three different
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
Appropriations here
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
so you'd have to pick kind of where
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
you'd want that to come from
 
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
reduce one of those to add it to fund
 
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
the position do you have a press
 
00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:15.299 align:start position:0%
preference Mr commissioner it should
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
probably come out of uh 64.65 I think is
 
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
the larger one
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
what do you want us to do just do 150
 
00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:24.299 align:start position:0%
000 as part of the
 
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
or we can fund you know just allow us to
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
a fund a position a stem educator
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
administrator out of that section
 
00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:33.419 align:start position:0%
correct do we have to say that that's
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
actually a good idea yeah okay yeah we
 
00:19:39.529 --> 00:19:39.539 align:start position:0%
would and so so I can uh I can add that
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
you know may also fund the stem
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
administrator in RSA 21n13 that's
 
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
established there the other thing I
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
think we just would want a little bit of
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
information on is on page 30 of house
 
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
bill 2. line eight where it talks about
 
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
the department retaining up to three
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
percent of these funds for uh
 
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
administering the program and that's
 
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
somewhat unusual to see a cost
 
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
allocation of General funds to support
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
general fund Administration so I don't
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
know if the department want to speak to
 
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
that because we we will see that later
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
in the education trust fund section as
 
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.650 align:start position:0%
in the education trust fund section as
well

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh page 30 line eight
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
it would give us enough so I was just
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
going to do the math I think that would
 
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
yeah that's 150 so we'll do that but it
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
does say not it does say not more than
 
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars so but more than
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand won't be adequate right
 
00:20:36.409 --> 00:20:36.419 align:start position:0%
right that's what I'm saying yeah
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
yeah well finally
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
so where are we if I may yeah if we just
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
change the no more than 50 000 to no
 
00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
more than 150 000 that would pretty much
 
00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
cover an administrator position sure
 
00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:51.539 align:start position:0%
strike the fifty thousand and leave it
 
00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:54.059 align:start position:0%
at up to three percent I I would prefer
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
to keep the cap just because at the end
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
of the day this program May grow more
 
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:00.260 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to end up with a uh
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
expansive line item there but up to 150
 
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
should more than cover it and can be
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
adjusted further in other hb2s and
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's the end of my comment here talk
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
about a minute line eight correct in on
 
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
page 30 line seven eight just putting a
 
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
one in front of the 50 and then we do
 
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
not need to fund the admin anymore
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's the funds for the admin I suggest
 
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
that we're clear so the three percent is
 
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
about 150 is 150 000 of the
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation anyways yeah same amount
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
same way to get there
 
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:38.210 align:start position:0%
same way to get there
yep

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.770 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:41.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
make it 150. and it should be an up two
 
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.029 align:start position:0%
make it 150. and it should be an up two
though

00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:21:48.529 --> 00:21:48.539 align:start position:0%
yeah because I don't wanna just like if
 
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
I don't need it I shouldn't spend it
 
00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:50.690 align:start position:0%
I don't need it I shouldn't spend it
right

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.770 align:start position:0%
right
okay

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
so so before we do that can I point out
 
00:21:57.409 --> 00:21:57.419 align:start position:0%
that these funds say that they shall not
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
lapse the 150 000 would only be for one
 
00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
year that would be the cost for one year
 
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
if this program went two years that
 
00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
would be three hundred thousand dollars
 
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
for two years to support this program so
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
150 000 would only be one year of salary
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:24.289 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:24.299 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
yeah the cleaner way to do this would be
 
00:22:27.289 --> 00:22:27.299 align:start position:0%
to appropriate money for the position
 
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
appropriate money for each of the three
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
components of this program right and and
 
00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:33.799 align:start position:0%
this is where I'm getting back to the
 
00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
retaining money from a general fund
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
appropriation to I'm not sure what that
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
if that is for the position that fifty
 
00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:42.539 align:start position:0%
thousand was for the position then I
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
feel like you could take that out and
 
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:49.799 align:start position:0%
with that whole section take out that
 
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
Roman four on page 30 by eight and just
 
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
directly fund the position okay would
 
00:22:59.810 --> 00:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
and then the only question would be if
 
00:23:06.409 --> 00:23:06.419 align:start position:0%
you wanted to keep this Net Zero so
 
00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
you're going to add let's say it's 150
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
000 a year for the position which
 
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
appropriation would you want to reduce
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
to do that so you've got the 4.9 yeah
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
so the 4.9 is 500 000 for one thing 4
 
00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:24.299 align:start position:0%
million for another thing and 455 for a
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
third thing so if you go to page 29 of
 
00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 Section 64 you'll see that
 
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
breakout so we just want to make it
 
00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:31.570 align:start position:0%
breakout so we just want to make it
clear

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:31.580 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
if if the true intent here is to keep
 
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
this in Net Zero to fund the position
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
and still fund those
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
three Appropriations I think one would
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
have you'd have to have an offset I
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
would take it out of Roman numeral too
 
00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:48.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
do you agree yes okay and I'll work with
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
the department to get the exact so we
 
00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
fund that position at the proper labor
 
00:23:59.330 --> 00:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
grade and step that they think it would
 
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
need to be because it might not be 150
 
00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:03.140 align:start position:0%
exact but whatever
 
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:05.940 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
so we've moved are you blocking all
 
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
want to do one at a time
 
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.830 align:start position:0%
want to do one at a time
uh

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
well I think I think Mickey has it been
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
doing we can do him as a group because
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
he he can he can do paperwork to it's
 
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
like uh so what he wants so then we're
 
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
talking about section 6263
 
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
64 and 65 with an amendment to follow
 
00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.450 align:start position:0%
64 and 65 with an amendment to follow
for

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:42.539 align:start position:0%
uh funding the position we would reduce
 
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
Roman two so the four million uh for the
 
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
purposes of encouraging individuals
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
holding it eligible so that Roman 2 on
 
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
page 29 would be reduced by the cost to
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
fund the position and then
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
would come out yeah correct
 
00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
everybody in favor of that raise your
 
00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:01.700 align:start position:0%
hand okay
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
I was just going to speak to it because
 
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:07.740 align:start position:0%
I had experience in high school
 
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I had experience in high school
 
00:25:12.289 --> 00:25:12.299 align:start position:0%
where we didn't get electrical
 
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
electronics training
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
so when you take the test for the Air
 
00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:19.559 align:start position:0%
Force you you pull you uh score pulling
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
so and then later on I
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
I did all right
 
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.630 align:start position:0%
I did all right
okay

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
so that takes us to which section next
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
uh section 34 pay or page 34 section
 
00:25:31.919 --> 00:25:33.649 align:start position:0%
uh section 34 pay or page 34 section
9192

00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
9192
 
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
and I do know that uh Deputy
 
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Christine Brennan wishes he
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
was here to talk to this because this is
 
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
one of her favorite programs
 
00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
um and I will tell you that this year we
 
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
had more Educators apply and recommend
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
recommended as teacher of the year than
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
we've ever had in the past so very good
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
this would actually change the nature of
 
00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
the program
 
00:25:59.810 --> 00:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
such that this would become a funded
 
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
position so essentially the state would
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
be paying the teacher of the year for a
 
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
year to just be focused on teacher of
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
the year activity so the way that it
 
00:26:09.049 --> 00:26:09.059 align:start position:0%
works now is the teacher of the year is
 
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
nominated they're in the school district
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
they still have teaching
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
responsibilities but we balance those
 
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
responsibilities with their
 
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
extracurricular things that they do for
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
Teacher of the Year this would allow
 
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:20.940 align:start position:0%
them to be full-time teacher of the year
 
00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
as well as provide a stipend to the
 
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
school to be able to pay for someone
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
else to cover for that person
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
00:26:30.169 --> 00:26:30.179 align:start position:0%
thank you as we had the Kristen
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
McCullough award and I believe
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
over years that did a similar thing does
 
00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
that still exist it does not it does not
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
I mean so generally the way that I fund
 
00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
this now is I go out to Industry
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
partners and I ask for donations and
 
00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:44.940 align:start position:0%
we've been successful getting close to
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
that as former deputy I too had to do
 
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
teacher of the year so I'm very familiar
 
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.590 align:start position:0%
teacher of the year so I'm very familiar
um

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
anything that we can do to promote the
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
value of our Public School teachers I
 
00:26:59.810 --> 00:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
think is of high value and actually it
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
would be great if we could do something
 
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
like this I really like the thought of
 
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.149 align:start position:0%
like this I really like the thought of
it

00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
um and I would definitely support this
 
00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
because I think
 
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
it's such a
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
a good
 
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
image to promote for our teachers across
 
00:27:18.769 --> 00:27:18.779 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:27:21.169 --> 00:27:21.179 align:start position:0%
um and we certainly will have a lot more
 
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
interest in this program because now
 
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
we've got interest we have 300
 
00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
applications I understand that which is
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
a great thing yes please so just to be
 
00:27:33.649 --> 00:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
clear like when I first started in this
 
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
role like six years ago we had you know
 
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
10 or 15 people applying every year just
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
like nobody was doing anything but we've
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
just we've been out we've been talking
 
00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
to Educators encouraging them to apply
 
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to recommend
 
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
individuals and we've gone from a
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
handful to hundreds these non-lapsing
 
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:55.370 align:start position:0%
handful to hundreds these non-lapsing
funds

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
could we make them non-lapsing
 
00:27:59.810 --> 00:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
it just then you have I don't even know
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
if that's necessary all right okay thank
 
00:28:02.159 --> 00:28:03.169 align:start position:0%
if that's necessary all right okay thank
you

00:28:03.169 --> 00:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:28:03.179 --> 00:28:04.810 align:start position:0%
you
right

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:04.820 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:09.539 align:start position:0%
um would would you still be going out to
 
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:15.409 --> 00:28:15.419 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I say that again oh would you
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
still be going out to your industry
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
Partners uh to get more funding uh to
 
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:22.140 align:start position:0%
you would only because I want to make
 
00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:24.179 align:start position:0%
sure that they continue to have skin in
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
the game of the success of our education
 
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
system which is one of the advantages I
 
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
see to going out and working with our
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
partners thank you yeah so to make sure
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
I understand this correctly this is 250
 
00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
over two years so it would be 125 a year
 
00:28:41.289 --> 00:28:41.299 align:start position:0%
you said it will be used both to
 
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.039 align:start position:0%
basically compensate the teacher that we
 
00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:46.740 align:start position:0%
pull out of the school to just be the
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
teacher of the year for a year and there
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
would be a stipend for the school
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
district I have only if we're not going
 
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:53.820 align:start position:0%
to pay people twice right so they don't
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
have to pay that teacher therefore right
 
00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
so I was wondering why the stipend for
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
the school list yeah nobody's nobody
 
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
gets to double up I don't know what the
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
differential will be in terms of you
 
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
know if they have to bring into a
 
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
long-term sub and if there's an
 
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
additional incremental cost the the
 
00:29:09.409 --> 00:29:09.419 align:start position:0%
intent of that is to just make sure that
 
00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
the school district does not lose money
 
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
because that penalized exactly right
 
00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:15.059 align:start position:0%
correct and then what would be the
 
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
duties of the teacher of the year as a
 
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
full-time teacher of the year I would
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate just a bit obviously I
 
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
understand the you know recognition part
 
00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
but what would they do over the year
 
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think that that has been
 
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
fully fleshed out in terms of where they
 
00:29:30.169 --> 00:29:30.179 align:start position:0%
would you know the the specific duties
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
that they would do but we imagine that
 
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
they would be doing
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
um a lot of training uh programming for
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
educators in terms of you know these are
 
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
the teacher of the years these are the
 
00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
most highly recognized Educators um and
 
00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
so how is it that they have been
 
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
successful in their classrooms engaging
 
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
students engaging their Community they
 
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
would be speaking to parents and parent
 
00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
groups in terms of how to help their
 
00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
children be successful in that
 
00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
educational environment but the program
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
has not been fully developed thank you
 
00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
question I just want to make sure this
 
00:30:03.649 --> 00:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
is public school teachers public charter
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
and public schools this is for our
 
00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
teacher of the year program which is a
 
00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
other questions can I clarify that yeah
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
because Candace no we actually have
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
teachers the issuer from our non-public
 
00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:18.179 align:start position:0%
schools as well because we've had Bishop
 
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
Brady in like a couple years ago yeah
 
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
they have to hold a New Hampshire
 
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.490 align:start position:0%
they have to hold a New Hampshire
certificate

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:32.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
I have a second to move the item
 
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
yeah all those in favor
 
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.049 align:start position:0%
yeah all those in favor
okay

00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:42.059 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:45.649 --> 00:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
moving on okay page 57 line item
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner I'm sorry can we go back to
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
the Civics commission and the
 
00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:51.059 align:start position:0%
appropriation yeah the two million for
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
the line enemas so we're on uh
 
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
Pages it starts on page 32 sections 86
 
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
oh this sorry about that I didn't have
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
that one highlighted so I skipped over
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:10.919 align:start position:0%
um so this uh basically creates the
 
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
commission on New Hampshire Civics which
 
00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
includes a broad spectrum of
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
participants in terms of who
 
00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:19.980 align:start position:0%
participates on that including three
 
00:31:21.889 --> 00:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
public members appointed by the governor
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh the chair of New Hampshire civics or
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
their designee the Chief Justice of the
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court Secretary of State a the
 
00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
chief administrative judge of the
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
Superior Court the chief administrative
 
00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
judge for the Circuit Court Commissioner
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
of Education two New Hampshire Civics
 
00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
Educators appointed by the commissioner
 
00:31:39.769 --> 00:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
and two members of the House of
 
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
Representatives appointed by the Speaker
 
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
of the House one member of the Senate
 
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Senate President and
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
one member of the governor's office
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor and
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
essentially the commission is tasked
 
00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
with the goal of coming up with and
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
creating a textbook and related
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
curriculum and you'll notice that that's
 
00:31:57.889 --> 00:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
something that the department has to in
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
the state is traditionally not involved
 
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
in curriculum development curriculum
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
specifically designed for New Hampshire
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
students and teachers to help them
 
00:32:06.889 --> 00:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
explore history Heritage and and
 
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
principles of New Hampshire Constitution
 
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
and the government it established we are
 
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
required I'm not sure if they we don't
 
00:32:16.669 --> 00:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
we don't have any um you know estimates
 
00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of the funding but we're
 
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
required to provide a paper copy of the
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
published textbook available to each New
 
00:32:24.169 --> 00:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire classroom Civics classroom as
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
well as an interactive website some of
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
you may have seen the Civics program
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
that we have in fourth grade that was
 
00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
developed by New Hampshire Civics which
 
00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:34.740 align:start position:0%
is a great Civics program for our fourth
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
grade students about New Hampshire
 
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
government and New Hampshire history so
 
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
I imagine it would follow along the same
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
type of you know modality and
 
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
essentially that's what this
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation is for
 
00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.269 align:start position:0%
appropriation is for
Russian

00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
Russian
 
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
is there a commission already or some
 
00:32:51.289 --> 00:32:51.299 align:start position:0%
group of people working on this um I was
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
Betty camposi was asking me about this
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
and I assumed it was sort of the same
 
00:32:57.769 --> 00:32:57.779 align:start position:0%
thing so can you tie those make the
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
connection for me there we can and they
 
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
are through the you know one of the
 
00:33:03.049 --> 00:33:03.059 align:start position:0%
appointees to the organization from the
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
organization New Hampshire Civics which
 
00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:06.659 align:start position:0%
is working on that effort so in other
 
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
words like so this is really now merging
 
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
those efforts so that their efforts
 
00:33:12.289 --> 00:33:12.299 align:start position:0%
right now have been happening over here
 
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
that they merge with the rest of us in
 
00:33:15.649 --> 00:33:15.659 align:start position:0%
terms of we're all working in the same
 
00:33:15.659 --> 00:33:16.909 align:start position:0%
terms of we're all working in the same
direction

00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:33:16.919 --> 00:33:17.990 align:start position:0%
direction
question

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm just concerned
 
00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.590 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm just concerned
about

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:24.779 align:start position:0%
um the ability of this to easily become
 
00:33:24.779 --> 00:33:26.750 align:start position:0%
um the ability of this to easily become
political

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
political
 
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
um what are the guarantees that it will
 
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
be a political in nature and it will be
 
00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.370 align:start position:0%
be a political in nature and it will be
unbiased

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
unbiased
 
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
um just right now we are existing in a
 
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:40.860 align:start position:0%
highly political Arena and
 
00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.169 align:start position:0%
highly political Arena and
civics

00:33:42.169 --> 00:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
civics
 
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
essentially should not be like that I
 
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
mean there are facts and
 
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
how to do things
 
00:33:51.409 --> 00:33:51.419 align:start position:0%
and I wouldn't have a problem with it
 
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
but I fear
 
00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.409 align:start position:0%
but I fear
that

00:33:54.409 --> 00:33:54.419 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
depending upon
 
00:33:59.450 --> 00:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
the members of the commission
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
how it would be put together that's my
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
concern how how assure me that this
 
00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:08.339 align:start position:0%
won't happen well I mean I don't know
 
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
that I can assure you I mean the
 
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
governor is going to appoint individuals
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know who he's going to appoint
 
00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:15.419 align:start position:0%
um you do have a number of people who
 
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
are a political particularly you know
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
the chair of New Hampshire Civics the
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court you
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
know the Secretary of State the chief
 
00:34:25.369 --> 00:34:25.379 align:start position:0%
administrative judge so there are a
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
number of appointees to this that are
 
00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:30.419 align:start position:0%
apolitical positions and so I would hope
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't go there representative
 
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
Heath but I don't know that I even have
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
the ability to tell you that it can't
 
00:34:37.629 --> 00:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
get there
 
00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
when I worked at the department one of
 
00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:42.419 align:start position:0%
the things that I had worked very hard
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
to try and promote was a Civics
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum that was Performance Based
 
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:50.700 align:start position:0%
and had activities like kindergarteners
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
would do some kind of a Hands-On project
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
first graders would do something and
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
second graders uh and then the fourth
 
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:00.599 align:start position:0%
grade that's kind of the full-blown um
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
you know talking with New Hampshire
 
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:04.740 align:start position:0%
history you know but it they would be
 
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
actively engaged in the learning and
 
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
they'd be some kind of a rubric that
 
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
would um look at it and so the kids
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
really had an understanding because they
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
really were part of it you know they'd
 
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
get their parents to go vote you know
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
they'd see how the process worked is do
 
00:35:23.089 --> 00:35:23.099 align:start position:0%
you anticipate anything like that maybe
 
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
being in this book
 
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:29.220 align:start position:0%
so I don't know about that because as I
 
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
read this statute I don't know that it's
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
like it's a book and we have a K-12
 
00:35:35.569 --> 00:35:35.579 align:start position:0%
system right so we're probably referring
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
to kind of a middle or High School type
 
00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
of thing what I can say is and I think
 
00:35:40.609 --> 00:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
um you know I've demonstrated this move
 
00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:44.579 align:start position:0%
kind of talked about it is the need for
 
00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:47.220 align:start position:0%
engaging pedagogy not we're not trying
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
to put kids to sleep these days yes
 
00:35:48.599 --> 00:35:50.810 align:start position:0%
to put kids to sleep these days yes
exactly

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
all right so if I have any say over it I
 
00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
can tell you that we will drive towards
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know uh engagement in terms of the
 
00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
pedagogy and something this
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
performance-based maybe with activities
 
00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
built in So when you say performance is
 
00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
like a competency base like do we do you
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
learn the things or didn't you learn it
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
is that what you mean well with the
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
rubric that that
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
shows examples of different levels to
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
which kids achieve too yep so that would
 
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
be competency-based so so what is it
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
that you have demonstrated your ability
 
00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
to do so all right thank you
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
yeah I have some concerns too I just
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
want to express
 
00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
um you know we're living on a climate
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
where we are limiting what we are able
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
to teach in English you know the
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
legislatures are limiting to teachers
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
what they can teach in particular with
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
history and particularly with English
 
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
when something like the Diary of Anne
 
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
Frank was a required reading when I was
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
a kid and now it's banned in some states
 
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
you know this is bizarre and I worry
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
that this becomes a vehicle for going
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
down that path that has become a way to
 
00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
put in restrictions of what teachers
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you I can assure you that speaking
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
for myself I don't plan to ban any books
 
00:36:57.839 --> 00:36:59.630 align:start position:0%
for myself I don't plan to ban any books
whatsoever

00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
um you know allowing parents to control
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
what kids may want to see that's a
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
totally different story but not Banning
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
books just to Echo though to follow up
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
on representative hits point
 
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
what I took her to say and what I would
 
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
say for myself is that I want to see
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
that kids as a result of whatever
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
resources we give them have the ability
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
to apply those not just repeat back
 
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
whatever the books say and I think
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
that's in a nutshell whatever language
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
you want to use about it what I I I'm
 
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
interested in seeing competence is that
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know can be tested and proven that
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
yeah that information can be used rather
 
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
than just repeat it back you know that's
 
00:37:41.569 --> 00:37:41.579 align:start position:0%
where I'm coming from when I'm looking
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
at any outcome of an education program
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
so I want to hear you I mean I think
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
that that's both of you are just talking
 
00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
about Good pedagogy right in terms of
 
00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
making sure the students learn stuff so
 
00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:52.490 align:start position:0%
making sure the students learn stuff so
Mary

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
Mary
 
00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm just wondering
 
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
about the funds if these are lapsing or
 
00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing funds for this particular
 
00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.810 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing funds for this particular
item

00:37:59.810 --> 00:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
item
 
00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:05.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
which is probably appropriate given the
 
00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:08.339 align:start position:0%
amount of time that something like that
 
00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:10.140 align:start position:0%
would take to make happen
 
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
well um just in another line of thought
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
um I am a little bit concerned about
 
00:38:19.609 --> 00:38:19.619 align:start position:0%
creating a print textbook in the age of
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
of modernization that we live in and I'm
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if the department has
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
considered an e-book instead so I share
 
00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
that concern and in particular if you
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
imagine it says a paper copy of the
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
published textbook like that's was that
 
00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
me one textbook per page so I see this
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
as really curricular materials that are
 
00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
available to the actual classes where
 
00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:41.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.069 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
did I hear that parents are going to be
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
part of this commission there are no
 
00:38:55.849 --> 00:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
parents currently listed as members of
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
the commission uh to follow up
 
00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
parents should have uh
 
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
some say in the curriculum I think
 
00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:04.619 align:start position:0%
that'd be wonderful I mean we have no
 
00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
objection to that maybe maybe they
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
should be added
 
00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
I think that that would be a good
 
00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:15.470 align:start position:0%
I think that that would be a good
addition

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
hey big guy you're the one that's
 
00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
what is it going to say
 
00:39:22.849 --> 00:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
add a parent or a couple parents I mean
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
because we have like we have three
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
public members appointed by the governor
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
but you could also just say three parent
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
members but you could have you could
 
00:39:32.089 --> 00:39:32.099 align:start position:0%
specify you know have three parents of
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
you know New Hampshire school students
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
educated by a public educated or certain
 
00:39:47.569 --> 00:39:47.579 align:start position:0%
or in a New Hampshire Public in New
 
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire qualified education program
 
00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:50.450 align:start position:0%
Hampshire qualified education program
yeah

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know so that one of three at least
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
is a parent who will have a voice so
 
00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
there'd be two at large and then one
 
00:39:59.690 --> 00:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
defined as
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
parent of purchase of a student in a
 
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
qualified New Hampshire education
 
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
program okay I'm just saying again
 
00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
because I see Mickey writing over there
 
00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
what would we be comfortable with two
 
00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
parents and one at Large
 
00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
I'm just asking because again you know I
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
have no problem you know I don't want it
 
00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
to be all patterns because there are
 
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
people who don't no longer have kids of
 
00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
school agent yet have every right to be
 
00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
represented I'm just trying to find a
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
balance you know
 
00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
I I come to think of it I'm actually
 
00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
fine with just one parent because there
 
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
is nothing to prevent the Governor from
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
adding more parents if they feel like it
 
00:40:35.089 --> 00:40:35.099 align:start position:0%
but this gives them the more flexibility
 
00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
and we made the point that we want at
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
least one parent so I'll I'll stick with
 
00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
that and uh withdraw my suggestions
 
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:47.450 align:start position:0%
that and uh withdraw my suggestions
okay

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
so yes on page 32 of House Bill 2 line
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
37 where it's three public members
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor we would add
 
00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
something to the tune of one of which
 
00:40:58.609 --> 00:40:58.619 align:start position:0%
shall be a parent of a student in a
 
00:40:59.810 --> 00:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
qualified New Hampshire education
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
program okay good I would you know just
 
00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
add I guess for argument's sake there
 
00:41:07.609 --> 00:41:07.619 align:start position:0%
most likely one out of the three would
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
be apparent anyway I don't really know
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
if we need to get that specific about it
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
chances are one of those people will
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
have kids and I would just as soon I
 
00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
would just as soon leave it open to the
 
00:41:19.849 --> 00:41:19.859 align:start position:0%
governor to find three qualified people
 
00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
as a people who just happened to have a
 
00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
biological child or whatever so I'm fine
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
with the way that it is
 
00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
um I don't like when we get too specific
 
00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:40.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.609 --> 00:41:43.619 align:start position:0%
yeah they're it's their choice I mean it
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
we we have in uh in our history
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
go go with civics
 
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
the U.S Supreme Court Time and Time and
 
00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
Again has sided with the parents to
 
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
control the education and the upbringing
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
of their children and this is part of
 
00:41:57.119 --> 00:41:58.190 align:start position:0%
of their children and this is part of
them

00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
Mary thank you Mr chair I'm opposed to
 
00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:01.670 align:start position:0%
Mary thank you Mr chair I'm opposed to
this

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
um I just think in our current climate
 
00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.109 align:start position:0%
um I just think in our current climate
historically

00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
historically
 
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
we have not as legislators dictated
 
00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:11.930 align:start position:0%
we have not as legislators dictated
curriculum

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
um usually it's something we've left up
 
00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:17.339 align:start position:0%
to local control we've set up standards
 
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
and guidelines at the department of Ed
 
00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
but nothing this um
 
00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.750 align:start position:0%
but nothing this um
structured

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
structured
 
00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:25.619 align:start position:0%
um so I will be voting against this
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
so we're going to leave the parents in
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
or we're not going to leave the parents
 
00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
as a vote yeah
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
we would move to include the one parent
 
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
language as suggested
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
um just because again while I completely
 
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
understand that you can have three
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
people who are not parents and be very
 
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
qualified to talk about Civics and
 
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:56.220 align:start position:0%
whatnot I think that having direct
 
00:42:58.609 --> 00:42:58.619 align:start position:0%
access to you know the experiences of
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
one or more children in the current
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
schools would be helpful in just terms
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
of in terms of informing the commission
 
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
of what the you know situations are that
 
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
may arise on a daily basis and having
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
one voice to represent that out of God
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
knows how many members I'm not even
 
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
gonna go back out I think is a very
 
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh adjustment and we are
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
setting we are prescribing the
 
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
membership of this so clarifying that
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
prescription is fully within the bounds
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee in hb2 okay so all
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
those in favor of adding a language
 
00:43:32.569 --> 00:43:32.579 align:start position:0%
about one school one parent of school
 
00:43:32.579 --> 00:43:34.250 align:start position:0%
about one school one parent of school
age

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
age
 
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
student whatever the words are raise
 
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
your hand on just that one
 
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
4 to 40. all right
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
yeah five to two
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
I gotta get my hand out all right now on
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
the item uh before we go to the next
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
item if I just a clarification question
 
00:43:57.849 --> 00:43:57.859 align:start position:0%
on an earlier item
 
00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
we moved funds on the Department of
 
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:01.740 align:start position:0%
Education computer science
 
00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
Appropriations we took funds to fund the
 
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
administrator position I want to make
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
sure I understand whether we moved 150
 
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
or 300 you know whether we moved the
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
150th per year or we did it for two
 
00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
years and we are taking 300 of that just
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
to clarify that my understanding was
 
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
that it was 150 per year 150 per year so
 
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
we we moved a net of 300 out of the 4
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
million just making sure we're on the
 
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
same page I wasn't sure if that was
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
explicit to discussed thank you okay now
 
00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
back to item 86 86 through
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
88 88
 
00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:40.700 align:start position:0%
by Shoah
 
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
of this item all those in favor
 
00:44:47.569 --> 00:44:47.579 align:start position:0%
all opposed
 
00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
okay it'll go forward four to three
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
and just so the committee knows I'm
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
going to make a technical correction on
 
00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
Section 87. you'll notice there's no
 
00:44:59.329 --> 00:44:59.339 align:start position:0%
what we refer to as warrant language on
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
there the statement that says the
 
00:45:01.849 --> 00:45:01.859 align:start position:0%
governor May draw a warrant against
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
funds not otherwise appropriate I think
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
that was probably just missed in
 
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
drafting so for that appropriation
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
section you'll see some different
 
00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
language there just to make that
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
technical correction fine
 
00:45:12.119 --> 00:45:13.910 align:start position:0%
technical correction fine
okay

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:18.839 align:start position:0%
moving right along okay so item 163
 
00:45:20.809 --> 00:45:20.819 align:start position:0%
is the definition of an eligible student
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
and I don't know that there's a specific
 
00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:30.660 align:start position:0%
appropriation associated with that
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
and I don't know and again I know you
 
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
have are taking this particular issue up
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
in a lot of different contexts so I want
 
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
to know
 
00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
go over something that's already been
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
going over somewhere else but if there's
 
00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:42.300 align:start position:0%
the appropriate Forum I'm happy to have
 
00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
and in particular what I'm referring to
 
00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:54.839 align:start position:0%
is there is House Bill 464 which
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately will be before the uh the
 
00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:02.990 align:start position:0%
ultimately will be before the uh the
Senate

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
so do we want to have that conversation
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
now or do you I'm sorry which item is it
 
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
um so it's okay it's uh item 163.
 
00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:18.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
57 yep
 
00:46:23.569 --> 00:46:23.579 align:start position:0%
please okay
 
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
um so this is dealing with the
 
00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
eligibility of the
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
um education Freedom account students
 
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:29.870 align:start position:0%
um education Freedom account students
and

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
um one of the items that I saw in that
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
hb2 language that I know is being
 
00:46:38.089 --> 00:46:38.099 align:start position:0%
considered by the various individuals is
 
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
um whose annual household income in
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
section uh 6A who's annual household
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
income at the time the student applies
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
for the program is less than or equal to
 
00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
300 I know there's been conversation
 
00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
about changing that number
 
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
um so and I would support a change to
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
that number if it was an increase in
 
00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
that number
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
um but then otherwise the the really the
 
00:46:59.089 --> 00:46:59.099 align:start position:0%
substance of what we had proposed was
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
one whereby we expanded categories of
 
00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
eligibility for students to participate
 
00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
in these efas particularly focusing on
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
students that are otherwise have some
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
type of a disadvantage in terms of
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
accessing their education some of those
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
individuals would probably qualify at
 
00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
the 300 or 350 or 500 percent levels
 
00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
anyways but by enumerating them in there
 
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
then they are not subject to that income
 
00:47:26.089 --> 00:47:26.099 align:start position:0%
limitation test how you can see the
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
types of students that we're talking
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
about are Foster Care students migratory
 
00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
students student who is homeless in the
 
00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:35.180 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
a student who is a mem you know whose
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
parents are members of the Armed Forces
 
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
who are you know quite frankly are
 
00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:43.740 align:start position:0%
students who find themselves sometimes
 
00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:45.050 align:start position:0%
students who find themselves sometimes
um

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know moving around quite a bit and
 
00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
their their education tends to get
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
disrupted so this may create some degree
 
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
of stability for them
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
uh our English language learner students
 
00:47:56.809 --> 00:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
um who uh you know are throughout our
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
system students who are persistently
 
00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:00.349 align:start position:0%
system students who are persistently
bullied

00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
bullied
 
00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
um and again that's as it's defined it's
 
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
not a capricious definition in terms of
 
00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
what's persistently believe is the
 
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
definition of RSA 193-ft colon 3. a
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
student with a disability
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
a student who has a manifest education
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
hardship would be eligible to
 
00:48:18.359 --> 00:48:19.390 align:start position:0%
hardship would be eligible to
participate

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
irrespective of their income limits and
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
then a student who lives in the
 
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
geographical boundaries of a district as
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
identified as a CSI school which is our
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
lowest performing schools would be
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
eligible so if you're in a
 
00:48:33.849 --> 00:48:33.859 align:start position:0%
non-performing school you'd be eligible
 
00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
and then a student who is in a school
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's defined as a persistently
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
dangerous school and again that's a
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
statutory definition for what a
 
00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
persistently dangerous school is
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
generally dealing with felony events
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
occurring in the school environment
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
and then finally a student who is a free
 
00:48:55.849 --> 00:48:55.859 align:start position:0%
and reduced price meal student and again
 
00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:58.140 align:start position:0%
as an example those are students who may
 
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise qualify anyways
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
I believe that we did pass that bill
 
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
okay so I didn't know if we need to have
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
more conversation here or not so so yes
 
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 367 changed on page 57
 
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
line 17 uh that sub paragraph a the
 
00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
threshold for income to be 350 percent
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
that's then that's one difference from
 
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
what we have here in front of us in
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 and then also in House Bill
 
00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
464 that next sub paragraph B I don't
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
believe exists the 500 percent just did
 
00:49:35.329 --> 00:49:35.339 align:start position:0%
not exist did not exist in 465. so those
 
00:49:37.609 --> 00:49:37.619 align:start position:0%
are the two variances that jumped out of
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
me between what passed the house last
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
week versus what you had before you and
 
00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
house bill 2. I'm of the opinion that we
 
00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
modify this to match what we passed in
 
00:49:50.569 --> 00:49:50.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
and that Amendment isn't drafting I
 
00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:55.140 align:start position:0%
don't have it to to pass out today it's
 
00:49:58.609 --> 00:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
in OLS now being drafted so uh
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
it can be done today if you if you
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
choose to or wait until I have the hard
 
00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
copy but that that's what is in the
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
crafting just the technical question
 
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
since it's a bill that was passed why do
 
00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
we need an OLS amendment is the language
 
00:50:13.609 --> 00:50:13.619 align:start position:0%
different in hb2 correct it is different
 
00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
house bill too I'm new yeah no so uh
 
00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
there's always different approaches here
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
one is to not have a part of household
 
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
two and have it pass in another another
 
00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
is to have it both bills but usually you
 
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
would want a uniform so you don't pass
 
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
two separate uh right positions on the
 
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
same statute
 
00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
so can I says Mickey a clarifying
 
00:50:35.809 --> 00:50:35.819 align:start position:0%
question so under subparagraph 6B when
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
you say that that was
 
00:50:40.609 --> 00:50:40.619 align:start position:0%
that language was excluded from 464 I
 
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
think is what you just said
 
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't all of B Because B
 
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
includes all of the subcategories that
 
00:50:49.849 --> 00:50:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:53.329 --> 00:50:53.339 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it's specific to just be as
 
00:50:56.650 --> 00:50:56.660 align:start position:0%
far as 500 questions
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
subcategories are there just without an
 
00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:02.210 align:start position:0%
subcategories are there just without an
income

00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
Everybody follow that one
 
00:51:04.079 --> 00:51:05.329 align:start position:0%
Everybody follow that one
okay

00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:05.339 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
yeah just two quick questions uh one
 
00:51:08.569 --> 00:51:08.579 align:start position:0%
really quick
 
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
persistently what is it called
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
persistently date no do we have any
 
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
persistently dangerous schools in New
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the second thing is a lot
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
of these students it seems would have
 
00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:24.589 align:start position:0%
of these students it seems would have
some

00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:51:26.569 --> 00:51:26.579 align:start position:0%
um relationship with Youth and Family
 
00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:29.339 align:start position:0%
Services or DHHS so there's got so
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
they're in they're in that system and
 
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:35.220 align:start position:0%
for good reason how do how will these
 
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
things interface if these kids are
 
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
pulled out if they're not in the public
 
00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.530 align:start position:0%
pulled out if they're not in the public
school

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:51:40.849 --> 00:51:40.859 align:start position:0%
um so they would still be eligible for
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
all of those HHS types of programming
 
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
this would just allow either the parent
 
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
or the guardian or the surrogate parent
 
00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
like we have surrogate educational
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
parents that may find that that student
 
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
in a particular education setting is not
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
being successful and really needs to
 
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
seek an alternative I mean as an example
 
00:51:59.329 --> 00:51:59.339 align:start position:0%
of that uh even this weekend I received
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
a call from Foster families who the
 
00:52:04.609 --> 00:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
student is in an educational setting is
 
00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
experience a foster kid so it's being
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
fostered so I'm hearing from the foster
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
parents and is in a situation probably
 
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
because of the child's Foster status is
 
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
receiving some bullying in school and
 
00:52:20.329 --> 00:52:20.339 align:start position:0%
and got placed into that school because
 
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
of the Foster relationships and so the
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
parents were seeking whether or not they
 
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
might this student would be eligible
 
00:52:27.049 --> 00:52:27.059 align:start position:0%
because through an education Freedom
 
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
account they would be able to redirect
 
00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:30.660 align:start position:0%
their the education to another study
 
00:52:31.609 --> 00:52:31.619 align:start position:0%
that they thought might be more
 
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:37.309 --> 00:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
if to do something additional in order
 
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
to work with the children Within These
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
systems or do you still foresee an
 
00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:44.099 align:start position:0%
additional burden to DHHS I don't it
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
would you use the same systems
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
which is do we have any I forget the
 
00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
words it's such a persistently oh but we
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
do not we measure that every year we
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
like to try not to have that we we did
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
have a scare recently that we thought we
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
had some and then we went back and
 
00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:00.780 align:start position:0%
looked at some police reports and
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
determined that those were not the types
 
00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:04.859 align:start position:0%
of charges that would have resulted in
 
00:53:04.859 --> 00:53:05.750 align:start position:0%
of charges that would have resulted in
that

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:07.010 align:start position:0%
that
Mary

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
Mary
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair commissioner
 
00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:13.140 align:start position:0%
you've expanded the categories quite
 
00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:14.329 align:start position:0%
you've expanded the categories quite
significantly

00:53:14.329 --> 00:53:14.339 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
my question to you is can you assure me
 
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
receiving efas and the environments
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
within which they are placed
 
00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
I am highly concerned about number one
 
00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
the accountability of the learning
 
00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
environment number two the safety
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
of the children I've been around for a
 
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
long time and I have seen some pretty
 
00:53:46.609 --> 00:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
nasty stuff
 
00:53:50.809 --> 00:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
within some families that
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
I was quite shocked that these things
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
would occur in how and can you assure me
 
00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
that children will be safe
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that question
 
00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
representative Heath and I share your
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
concern to make sure that our children
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
across the state are safe and we are
 
00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
doing all that we can to make sure that
 
00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
children are safe and as you know we
 
00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:15.300 align:start position:0%
want to make sure they're safe in let me
 
00:54:17.569 --> 00:54:17.579 align:start position:0%
just finish for a moment um in any of
 
00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
the educational settings that we have
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
them in and as you know when you say can
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
I assure you I don't know that I can
 
00:54:26.089 --> 00:54:26.099 align:start position:0%
give you 100 assurance that they're safe
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
in my traditional public schools and as
 
00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
you know we have educator misconduct
 
00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
that takes place uh students are exposed
 
00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
but we put in place programs we put in
 
00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
place security measures we put in place
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
various screening measures to try and do
 
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
all we can to make sure that those
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
children are safe because none of us
 
00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:44.660 align:start position:0%
want to see something happen to a child
 
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
just a full thank you Mr chair
 
00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:49.740 align:start position:0%
so in my many years of being an
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
administrator and a teacher
 
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:53.150 align:start position:0%
administrator and a teacher
um

00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
I have had to report numerous incidents
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
if I had not been
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
in the position I was in to report those
 
00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.770 align:start position:0%
in the position I was in to report those
behaviors

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:08.809 --> 00:55:08.819 align:start position:0%
they would have continued
 
00:55:11.089 --> 00:55:11.099 align:start position:0%
and I have to say
 
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
somehow someway I hope that within your
 
00:55:16.849 --> 00:55:16.859 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization or your
 
00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
department of Ed or whatever you're
 
00:55:20.569 --> 00:55:20.579 align:start position:0%
doing that there's some kind of
 
00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
guidelines put in place because I I told
 
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
the governor's office the same thing I'm
 
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
really worried because we have over 10
 
00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:31.140 align:start position:0%
000 children being homeschooled we don't
 
00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
know what the environment is
 
00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:34.790 align:start position:0%
know what the environment is
um

00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
I mean we've all read stories with the
 
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
book education we read her book and
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
that was not in New Hampshire
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
fortunately but I mean I just have to
 
00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:48.380 align:start position:0%
say that so often in the incense
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
incidences where
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
violations and perpetrations of children
 
00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
have occurred it's been the Educators in
 
00:55:59.569 --> 00:55:59.579 align:start position:0%
our Public Schools or public charter
 
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
schools that have identified those
 
00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
behaviors and have reported them who
 
00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
will report
 
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
to dcyf
 
00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:12.180 align:start position:0%
how will we know
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and as you know in New Hampshire
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
we're all you know mandatory reporters
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
right so wherever that context is
 
00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
whether it is a child who is being
 
00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
abused in public school or a child being
 
00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
abused outside of a traditional Public
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
School setting in one of these other
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
approved education programming we are
 
00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
all mandatory reporters and have an
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
obligation to make sure that we're
 
00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
other comments all right thank you thank
 
00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
you uh stormway Thunder that's 169 I
 
00:56:47.809 --> 00:56:47.819 align:start position:0%
believe isn't it I believe so 0.69 C
 
00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
right and uh also
 
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
um back in my earlier travels uh
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
Mrs Barrett from dcyf
 
00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
uh and as far as homeschooling is
 
00:57:03.049 --> 00:57:03.059 align:start position:0%
concerned they had one educational
 
00:57:03.059 --> 00:57:04.430 align:start position:0%
concerned they had one educational
neglect

00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
neglect
 
00:57:11.329 --> 00:57:11.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:18.059 align:start position:0%
is it the
 
00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
amendment to to to amend the hb2 to
 
00:57:23.569 --> 00:57:23.579 align:start position:0%
match the bills yeah that's what the
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
amendment would do would replace Section
 
00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
163 and House Bill 2 with essentially
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
the combination of 367 which goes from
 
00:57:34.609 --> 00:57:34.619 align:start position:0%
350 to 350 300 to 350 percent for the
 
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
federal poverty income threshold and
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
then 464 which is essentially removing
 
00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
that 500 threshold on the expanded
 
00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
categories okay so you would leave it in
 
00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:44.630 align:start position:0%
categories okay so you would leave it in
hp2

00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
hp2
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
correct and it would it would align with
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
367 and uh to just to make them align
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
yeah Okay so
 
00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:56.220 align:start position:0%
right second right now all those in
 
00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:58.250 align:start position:0%
right second right now all those in
favor

00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
favor
 
00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
for all those opposed
 
00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
four to three
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
so we have a number of additional items
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not again I don't know which ones we
 
00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
okay so most of these are adequacy and
 
00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
we're not doing those today I'm told
 
00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:20.390 align:start position:0%
we're not doing those today I'm told
okay

00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:27.650 align:start position:0%
okay
168.

00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839 align:start position:0%
I think 164 maybe we could touch on real
 
00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
quick okay education trust fund
 
00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
distributions and allowable uses correct
 
00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:49.250 align:start position:0%
distributions and allowable uses correct
nope

00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
page 58 so we're on page 58 education
 
00:58:56.569 --> 00:58:56.579 align:start position:0%
sections 164 167 education trust fund
 
00:58:58.370 --> 00:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
distributions and allowable usage and
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to let Caitlyn kind of walk us
 
00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
through those
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
so much of this is a kind of a rewrite
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
of the allowable uses of Education trust
 
00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:08.630 align:start position:0%
of the allowable uses of Education trust
fund

00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
um funding just to clarify the current
 
00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
uses of the education trust fund
 
00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:16.140 align:start position:0%
um specifically a lot of most of these
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
programs are already being paid out of
 
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
um the first one that we're discussing
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
is just clarifying regular adequacy the
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
distribution of
 
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
um charter school aid we actually
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
reference the wrong section of the law
 
00:59:36.049 --> 00:59:36.059 align:start position:0%
and the current loss or making sure we
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
reference the correct section distribute
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
Public School infrastructure grants
 
00:59:41.809 --> 00:59:41.819 align:start position:0%
those are the grants we discuss in
 
00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:43.740 align:start position:0%
detail on Friday those are currently
 
00:59:45.289 --> 00:59:45.299 align:start position:0%
being paid out of funding that's being
 
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:46.980 align:start position:0%
transferred from the education trust
 
00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
fund so we thought it would be good to
 
00:59:50.809 --> 00:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
add it here as an allowable expense as
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
well but it's currently being paid out
 
00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:55.799 align:start position:0%
of with education trust fund money
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
um the next on the list is to distribute
 
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
kindergarten grants again already being
 
01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
paid out of the education trust fund and
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
at the time we had language
 
01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:06.950 align:start position:0%
at the time we had language
um

01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
at the time when we had put it in the
 
01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
educational fund as an allowable expense
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
the legislature I think was still very
 
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
much up in the air and what kindergarten
 
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
funding and grants would look like so it
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
was more
 
01:00:20.809 --> 01:00:20.819 align:start position:0%
um General language and we clarified now
 
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
that we have a finalized kindergarten
 
01:00:26.569 --> 01:00:26.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
um to continue on through the list
 
01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:29.870 align:start position:0%
um to continue on through the list
um

01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
we allowed a distribution of funds for
 
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
RSA 194f which is the education trust or
 
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts again the
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account specifies that
 
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
those funds should be paid out of the
 
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
education trust fund under RSA 194f
 
01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:48.260 align:start position:0%
which establishes the program
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
distribution of lease a chartered Public
 
01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
Schools this is a change the Department
 
01:00:56.329 --> 01:00:56.339 align:start position:0%
of Education requested in its budget we
 
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
felt that Charter School lease Aid
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
should be paid on the education trust
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
fund rather than the general fund as it
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
um is similar to the building aid
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
program and we felt like there was a lot
 
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
of Nexus there and and moved that to the
 
01:01:11.289 --> 01:01:11.299 align:start position:0%
education trust fund during this budget
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
is a five or eight hundred thousand
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
dollar total appropriation in the
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
education trust fund that used to
 
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
previously be made in the in the general
 
01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:20.349 align:start position:0%
previously be made in the in the general
fund

01:01:20.349 --> 01:01:20.359 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:01:22.609 --> 01:01:22.619 align:start position:0%
costs associated with the Statewide
 
01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
Assessment program we discussed that in
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
detail again on Friday
 
01:01:29.809 --> 01:01:29.819 align:start position:0%
and then the one change that you'll see
 
01:01:32.329 --> 01:01:32.339 align:start position:0%
there which is a change for just this
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
biennium is allowing the education trust
 
01:01:38.329 --> 01:01:38.339 align:start position:0%
fund to pay for funding relative to
 
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
career and Tech education renovation
 
01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
programs um so those are kind of two
 
01:01:43.549 --> 01:01:43.559 align:start position:0%
different pieces that we can pay we can
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
discuss in total and then the last line
 
01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:47.339 align:start position:0%
in there is allowing the Department of
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
Education to retain funding from the
 
01:01:51.049 --> 01:01:51.059 align:start position:0%
education trust fund to administer
 
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
education trust fund programs
 
01:01:56.089 --> 01:01:56.099 align:start position:0%
um so those are all the changes that
 
01:01:58.130 --> 01:01:58.140 align:start position:0%
we've made do we want to discuss any of
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
those in detail or have questions of
 
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
those in detail question Dan so just to
 
01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand there is really
 
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
only one new use that you mentioned
 
01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
everything else you are just asking for
 
01:02:08.819 --> 01:02:09.770 align:start position:0%
everything else you are just asking for
that

01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
chapter to be updated to reflect the
 
01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:14.940 align:start position:0%
various ongoing uses of the fund that
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
kept being codified you know by the
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
legislature in various years right
 
01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:24.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:27.309 --> 01:02:27.319 align:start position:0%
oh sorry I mean
 
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:29.839 align:start position:0%
in the seats
 
01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:33.180 align:start position:0%
but basically okay I got it I appreciate
 
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:35.650 align:start position:0%
but basically okay I got it I appreciate
it

01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:35.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:38.329 --> 01:02:38.339 align:start position:0%
this could I ask is this a section where
 
01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
one percent of the education trust goes
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Ed this is correct
 
01:02:47.329 --> 01:02:47.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
I actually would like to take a moment
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
to kind of talk about that and relative
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
us writing that language
 
01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
um so we added this language to allow
 
01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
the department to have flexibility when
 
01:02:57.770 --> 01:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
we're administering a lot of these
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
programs now
 
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:01.559 align:start position:0%
um chairman Weiler actually brought up a
 
01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
pretty good point on Friday when he was
 
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
talking about different programs and
 
01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
other people running programs other than
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education because then
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education doesn't
 
01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
necess the Department of Education
 
01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
continues to come back to the
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
legislature ask for positions as
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
programs expand so over time the
 
01:03:20.089 --> 01:03:20.099 align:start position:0%
legislature has expanded many of these
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
programs substantially adequacy is a
 
01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
great example 10 years ago when I was
 
01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
running the adequacy formula it was a
 
01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
pretty basic formula now there are many
 
01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
sub grants within that formula there's a
 
01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
lot of data needs that are associated
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
with it there's a lot of technical
 
01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
assistance that is needed to be provided
 
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
to school districts to Charter Schools
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
to the legislature
 
01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
um and we have the same level of staff
 
01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:46.140 align:start position:0%
that are continuing to operate these
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
exact same programs representative
 
01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
Weiler was talking about
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
um even though a program has doubled the
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
program hasn't come back and asked the
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
department or asked the legislature for
 
01:03:57.530 --> 01:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
additional programs that was because
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
that program has an administrative set
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
aside and so that as the program grows
 
01:04:04.849 --> 01:04:04.859 align:start position:0%
and expands an administrative set-aside
 
01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
is actually an allowability of that
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
program too and allows the program to
 
01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
have that flexibility over time rather
 
01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:13.740 align:start position:0%
than coming back constantly to the
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
legislature saying we need another
 
01:04:17.089 --> 01:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
position we need another position
 
01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
um and overall the department has not
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily been as successful as
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
getting positions that we need to
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
operate programs and this has been a
 
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
huge constraint on Department of staff
 
01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.650 align:start position:0%
huge constraint on Department of staff
so

01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know actually kind of said one thing
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
to it I mean so this year as an example
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
we are required under federally to
 
01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
publish our school performance report
 
01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
cards and we were somewhat late getting
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
those out simply because we didn't have
 
01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
the staff to do the data extraction and
 
01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
uploads so I
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
understood I understand all that
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
definitely but to me one percent is an
 
01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
open pocket book there's let me finish
 
01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:52.730 align:start position:0%
open pocket book there's let me finish
please

01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:52.740 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:55.980 align:start position:0%
if you are seeking those additional
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
positions if you have needs I can
 
01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
understand that but this one percent is
 
01:05:04.849 --> 01:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
just nothing specified
 
01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
I can't support that there's especially
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
under the current Administration I'm
 
01:05:12.589 --> 01:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't mean to insult you face up
 
01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
but it's true
 
01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:14.809 align:start position:0%
but it's true
um

01:05:14.809 --> 01:05:14.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
it just it's it's I can't I didn't know
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
of no other department
 
01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money that you're asking
 
01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:22.670 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money that you're asking
for

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
especially right now so I cannot support
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
that one percent and I just
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
I know of no other department that from
 
01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.130 align:start position:0%
I know of no other department that from
state

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:34.140 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:35.210 align:start position:0%
state
public

01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
tax property funds would get without
 
01:05:42.289 --> 01:05:42.299 align:start position:0%
specifications of what you're going to
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
spend it on on a yearly basis if if this
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
is going on I I just I think it's wrong
 
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
I can't support it I think I understand
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
your needs I get that I mean been there
 
01:05:56.809 --> 01:05:56.819 align:start position:0%
done that and we
 
01:05:58.730 --> 01:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
um had a hard time even finding anybody
 
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
but we're in a climate right now where
 
01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
we are in good condition
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
we may not be in the future I I just one
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
percent of of a lot of money is is um
 
01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
without any specifications of how you're
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
going to use it is too much for me to
 
01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
approve so all we're asking for is the
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
authority to use this funding um we also
 
01:06:21.049 --> 01:06:21.059 align:start position:0%
would assume that we are we're not even
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
at this time asking to appropriate those
 
01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:24.900 align:start position:0%
funds we assume to use those funds we
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
would have to appropriate those funds to
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
which we would have to go and do a
 
01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
budget and say you know this much when
 
01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
money would go to class 10 or class 50
 
01:06:33.529 --> 01:06:33.539 align:start position:0%
or whatnot
 
01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
um all we're asking for right now is the
 
01:06:37.490 --> 01:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
author of the authority to if we don't
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
have the ability to potentially
 
01:06:40.319 --> 01:06:41.230 align:start position:0%
have the ability to potentially
um

01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
to operate the programs with the with
 
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
the staff and whatnot that we would need
 
01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
we would I'm guessing come back to
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
probably the official committee or in a
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
future budget say all right we we can
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
have one percent of these funds and then
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
this is how we're going to do X Y and Z
 
01:06:59.390 --> 01:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
I also do want to clarify that these are
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
not would not be property tax funding um
 
01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
funds because these funds are
 
01:07:05.569 --> 01:07:05.579 align:start position:0%
um would be other Revenue that's going
 
01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund as the
 
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
property tax funds never go into the
 
01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:10.619 align:start position:0%
education trust fund directly so the
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
department would never have access to
 
01:07:12.119 --> 01:07:14.329 align:start position:0%
department would never have access to
that

01:07:14.329 --> 01:07:14.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:16.609 --> 01:07:16.619 align:start position:0%
so we're not asking for no transparency
 
01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:19.140 align:start position:0%
all this funding would hit our state but
 
01:07:20.809 --> 01:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
our state books
 
01:07:22.609 --> 01:07:22.619 align:start position:0%
um we would work with the legislature
 
01:07:24.049 --> 01:07:24.059 align:start position:0%
like I said probably through fiscal or
 
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
other future but um to to do so and and
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
so when you're seeing if you look for at
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
a budget first say like title one where
 
01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
for example where we have one percent of
 
01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:37.140 align:start position:0%
that 40 million dollars to run Title One
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
um you see the amount that's flowing
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
through and then you also see the
 
01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
amounts that are being retained by the
 
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
department and we would expect a very
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
similar thing so we are at this point
 
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
we're just saying just give us the
 
01:07:49.789 --> 01:07:49.799 align:start position:0%
ability to and if we feel like we need
 
01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
to come to the legislature we then have
 
01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
this kind of mechanism right now we have
 
01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
no mechanism at all to fund positions
 
01:07:58.849 --> 01:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
and support for the Department as we
 
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
continue to grow these programs and
 
01:08:02.089 --> 01:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
continue to do the work to comply with
 
01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
the laws so if if that this helpful
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
representative Heath um even in my own
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
like you know I'm not too big on
 
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
spending any more money either so
 
01:08:12.289 --> 01:08:12.299 align:start position:0%
um but one of the things that you know
 
01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
appeal to me about this is it is
 
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
consistent with the federal approach to
 
01:08:18.169 --> 01:08:18.179 align:start position:0%
trying to do it right we get a grant
 
01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
then we get a percent set aside as you
 
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
know that's how it works and and then
 
01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
what we have to do is we got to go argue
 
01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
we don't have positions for this so it's
 
01:08:26.809 --> 01:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
not like you can just I can't go to
 
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
spend it on something I still would have
 
01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.630 align:start position:0%
spend it on something I still would have
to

01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
get this legislature to approve a
 
01:08:33.289 --> 01:08:33.299 align:start position:0%
position to be able to use for it but I
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
understand your your concerns
 
01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:36.829 align:start position:0%
understand your your concerns
Jim

01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
Jim
 
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
given that this is a new concept and I
 
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
appreciate the explanations but I would
 
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
appreciate if you wouldn't make a
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
decision on it today I kind of want to
 
01:08:45.769 --> 01:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
sleep on it and wrap my head around it a
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
bit more but this is very informational
 
01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
it's just I don't feel personally ready
 
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
to make a call on it right now just
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
because you know again I need a bit more
 
01:08:56.689 --> 01:08:56.699 align:start position:0%
time I find that when I sleep on stuff I
 
01:08:58.849 --> 01:08:58.859 align:start position:0%
get a better idea by the next day what
 
01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
line is the one percent on I'm trying to
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:10.249 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:09:10.249 --> 01:09:10.259 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:12.900 align:start position:0%
if I may while you're doing that um for
 
01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
the record will you say what one percent
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
is 10 million dollars approximately
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:09:22.849 --> 01:09:22.859 align:start position:0%
10 million and the other question I had
 
01:09:24.169 --> 01:09:24.179 align:start position:0%
um I think we'll go back to this but
 
01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
just since I have the mic on right now
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
um I propose the just for the biennium
 
01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
the Career and Technical education
 
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
renovation projects are you specifically
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
looking at Sugar Hill yeah in fact
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
that's when I did want to spend some
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
time talking about it as specifically is
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
the Sugar Hill project which was not
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
included in the capital budget so we
 
01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:42.380 align:start position:0%
went to Capital committee last week
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
generally the legislature funds two CTE
 
01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
Center renovation projects per year this
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
year one was included in well both were
 
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
included in the agency budget the
 
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
governor pushed forward the Sugar Hill
 
01:09:55.130 --> 01:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
project because the winner Squam had not
 
01:09:57.070 --> 01:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
yet received Community approval
 
01:09:59.570 --> 01:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
and because of the surplus funds that
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
were available in the trust fund he
 
01:10:03.169 --> 01:10:03.179 align:start position:0%
moved the Sugar Hill renovation into the
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and then we also
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
spoke to the capital committee about the
 
01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:09.900 align:start position:0%
winter Squam project they would have
 
01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
their vote at the end of this month on
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
like March 25th I believe it is what we
 
01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
want to just be careful of is that it
 
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't get lost in the cracks between
 
01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
you know Finance having it in terms of
 
01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
the use in the education trust fund and
 
01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
capital and each committee imagining
 
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
that the other body is taking care of it
 
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
but these are important projects for the
 
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
state we hope that we're able to move
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
those forward we spoke with the chair of
 
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
of capital three okay yesterday okay
 
01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:34.610 align:start position:0%
of capital three okay yesterday okay
wonderful

01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
you won't see it twice okay sure I just
 
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
I'm worried I don't see it at all right
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
that's what the question I had was uh to
 
01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:43.970 align:start position:0%
that's what the question I had was uh to
clarify

01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh whether it comes out of capital if it
 
01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
comes out of educational trust fund in
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
other words you're saying it just can
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
come out of Education trust fund is that
 
01:10:53.689 --> 01:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
what you're saying it is certainly
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
eligible to come out of the education
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
trust fund and we and again we just are
 
01:10:59.390 --> 01:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
advocating that the renovation is funded
 
01:11:01.729 --> 01:11:01.739 align:start position:0%
and we're not bias we don't care where
 
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
it comes from
 
01:11:06.169 --> 01:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
and I think and I think the uh
 
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
sure will this go through this
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
through this year as if it were a
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
capital project does Sugar Hill have do
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
they have their ducks in a row or are
 
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
they kind of cutting the line here a
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
little bit nope not cutting line at all
 
01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
they were in the queue and we had
 
01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
proposed them as a capital project in
 
01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
our agency budget they have all of their
 
01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
um the information together we can
 
01:11:30.890 --> 01:11:30.900 align:start position:0%
provide the committee with the
 
01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
specifications in terms of the drawings
 
01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
and the plans they have already received
 
01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
voter approval for this and they're just
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
waiting for the legislative approval to
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
move the project forward that project is
 
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
shovel ready like as soon as this gets
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
approved on July 1 they can put a shovel
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
in the ground
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
okay my question on this one percent is
 
01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
if that disappears what does it do
 
01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't do anything at the at this
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
time because it's just allowing the
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
department to use the money if if we
 
01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:00.659 align:start position:0%
come to you in the future and ask for
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
that right now the department doesn't
 
01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
even have the authority to use that
 
01:12:06.169 --> 01:12:06.179 align:start position:0%
unless otherwise appropriated
 
01:12:09.770 --> 01:12:09.780 align:start position:0%
we it's just been historically the
 
01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
legislature has been relatively adverse
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
to adding new general fund positions to
 
01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education however has
 
01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
continued to add additional requirements
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
and Reporting and grants and whatnot to
 
01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education on existing
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
staff and so we're forced to do several
 
01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
different things one just put it on
 
01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
somebody else's general fund plate and
 
01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
hopefully they have the time to do it
 
01:12:32.450 --> 01:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
but then you know that transpensive
 
01:12:34.729 --> 01:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
drive good employees out to ask a
 
01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
federally funded employee to do that and
 
01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
now that which we can't do with time and
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
effort but even if they could then they
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
end up missing missing Federal deadlines
 
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
which that's the commissioner just
 
01:12:47.209 --> 01:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
reference or three not doing it at all
 
01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
which we if you the legislature is
 
01:12:49.970 --> 01:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
writing a law and requiring the
 
01:12:51.649 --> 01:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
department to do it you know we would
 
01:12:53.149 --> 01:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
like to comply with that law and that
 
01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
requirement but we don't have the
 
01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
capacity to continue to do all of these
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
things without additional support so
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's positions it's it's some sort of
 
01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
authorization that that's all we're kind
 
01:13:05.689 --> 01:13:05.699 align:start position:0%
of looking for going forward right so
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's no appropriate creation at this
 
01:13:07.970 --> 01:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
um but if you didn't hear it in her
 
01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
voice so Caitlyn's feeling the pressure
 
01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
and her because it falls to her
 
01:13:15.410 --> 01:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
Department right uh you know as we
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
because we have a basic adequacy funding
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
formula and then we add a you know
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid or then we add you
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
know relief Aid and extraordinary needs
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
and grants right and every time you do
 
01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
one of these like we have to go back and
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
recalculate this for every single
 
01:13:30.410 --> 01:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
community and um and it becomes
 
01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
difficult to keep up with you all quite
 
01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:34.370 align:start position:0%
difficult to keep up with you all quite
frankly

01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:13:41.090 --> 01:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
um Mickey is there I understand
 
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:41.870 align:start position:0%
um Mickey is there I understand
um

01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
I'm troubled just by the language of the
 
01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
how it's done is there another way
 
01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.110 align:start position:0%
how it's done is there another way
to

01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
provide them with something but not
 
01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:58.140 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars is a lot of money on
 
01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
a yearly basis
 
01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
um help me here so
 
01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
so yes this this does set up similar to
 
01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
a federal or non-state funded program
 
01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
where you would have a cost allocation
 
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
to allocate State cost to a non-state
 
01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
cost not non-state funded Grant or flow
 
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
of money so this is trying to tap into
 
01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
State funds to fund something that is
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise state funded salaries benefits
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
administration at the Department of
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
Education what could be done here is to
 
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
add unallowable use of the education
 
01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
trust fund the administrative costs at
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education subject to
 
01:14:36.410 --> 01:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
amounts appropriated
 
01:14:37.729 --> 01:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
it's not an open warrant so to speak and
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
then whatever you appropriate Caitlyn
 
01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
had mentioned they come and ask for
 
01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:45.900 align:start position:0%
positions or you know whatever is funded
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
in here could be education trust fund as
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
a source of funds what we also heard
 
01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
from here is coming to fiscal there's
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
there's nothing there's no law now that
 
01:14:57.649 --> 01:14:57.659 align:start position:0%
permits the Department of Education to
 
01:14:59.209 --> 01:14:59.219 align:start position:0%
come to get Appropriations through
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal similar to how dot does with the
 
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
highway fund for winter maintenance for
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
instance so if that's something the
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
committee wanted to do to give
 
01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
uh an option for the Department to come
 
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
to fiscal
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
in between budget sessions I guess that
 
01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
that's something as well that you could
 
01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:15.890 align:start position:0%
that's something as well that you could
do

01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
that would make me feel a real lot
 
01:15:18.239 --> 01:15:19.189 align:start position:0%
that would make me feel a real lot
better

01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
um it would give you what you want it
 
01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
would give you the authority to go to
 
01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:24.350 align:start position:0%
would give you the authority to go to
fiscal

01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
um I'd be really happy with that
 
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
language rather than the one percent
 
01:15:30.649 --> 01:15:30.659 align:start position:0%
just it just
 
01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
I just can't do it but I mean I'm only
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
one vote so and I will say this section
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
is still there's a lot of other moving
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
Parts in here depending on what this
 
01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
committee does with the rest of the
 
01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
education trust fund programs if you
 
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
choose to switch them from General to
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
education there's been some talk about
 
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
moving some programs from education back
 
01:15:50.689 --> 01:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
to General so this would definitely be
 
01:15:52.729 --> 01:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
one you'd want to hold today and we can
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
work as a committee to deal with
 
01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
everything up to the one percent uh
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
section and then that one percent
 
01:16:00.169 --> 01:16:00.179 align:start position:0%
section as well something that works for
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
the committee and the department perhaps
 
01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:05.580 align:start position:0%
if you're if that makes is a comfortable
 
01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
comfort factor let's go down that road
 
01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
so something to the tune of uh listing
 
01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:15.900 align:start position:0%
that appropriate or ex let me back up uh
 
01:16:17.209 --> 01:16:17.219 align:start position:0%
administrative costs for the Department
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
of Education as appropriated by the
 
01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
general court would be an allowable use
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
and then come up with something where
 
01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
fiscal could be uh they could go to
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal for additional funds above and
 
01:16:32.169 --> 01:16:32.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
do you want to wait to vote till we have
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
that Amendment or are you comfortable we
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
would need
 
01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
for that provision we'll tentatively be
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
okay with but like I said there's other
 
01:16:43.610 --> 01:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
things happening in here for one like
 
01:16:46.729 --> 01:16:46.739 align:start position:0%
yeah so so you know we there's a lot of
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
other programs that are going back and
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
forth General and education we've
 
01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:51.659 align:start position:0%
discussed so once all those settle this
 
01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh going to fiscal for doe will be part
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
of that Amendment okay
 
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
like I'm fine either way but honestly I
 
01:16:59.149 --> 01:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
think that language is probably the
 
01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
right way to go and we don't have to
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
finalize it today but it's definitely
 
01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:05.159 align:start position:0%
something we should prepare and have it
 
01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
there because it it makes a lot of sense
 
01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
and it does address the you know
 
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
legitimate concerns that one may have
 
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
over the current language so I think
 
01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
it's a good story if I can just if
 
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
everyone just real quickly switches to
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
page six of this packet I think it's
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
part of your package to commissioner so
 
01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
this is the education trust fund
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
snapshot through the changes that this
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
committee has made to this point so if
 
01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
you look kind of starting on line 32
 
01:17:31.630 --> 01:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
you'll see some of those programs have
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
0.23 but now you see them so those are
 
01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
most of the ones that are being added
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
and that you'll see as we stand right
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
now there's 104 million dollars of a
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
surplus balance at the end of the
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
biennium in the education trust fund
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
this is where we've had past
 
01:17:47.689 --> 01:17:47.699 align:start position:0%
conversations as to
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
what you want to do with that whether
 
01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
you want to add more things to the
 
01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
education trust fund or move revenue and
 
01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
programs out of the education trust fund
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
so whatever you decide to do with this
 
01:17:59.090 --> 01:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
budget picture this RSA this section
 
01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
here should align with that and I think
 
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
we're we're not there yet well I think I
 
01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
think that a finance chair is of the
 
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
opinion that we've got to whittle down
 
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund back what it
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
was originally designed for and move a
 
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
lot of this stuff back into General
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
funds but I don't think we're ready to
 
01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
okay next section next
 
01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
so I'm just skipping hit I actually have
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
um let's stop that I need to be able to
 
01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
get to uh Cami and Caitlin will be able
 
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
to stay here and answer any additional
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
questions but I'm just starting are
 
01:18:31.490 --> 01:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
there any
 
01:18:33.649 --> 01:18:33.659 align:start position:0%
any of these areas that specifically you
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
want me to weigh in on for you and I'm
 
01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
happy to jump ahead to those could we do
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
the um uh court ordered placement and
 
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
the new law that we've just passed
 
01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
um and talk about how we're going to do
 
01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:46.550 align:start position:0%
um and talk about how we're going to do
that

01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:48.900 align:start position:0%
I was thinking that maybe
 
01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:51.709 align:start position:0%
I was thinking that maybe
um

01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:54.169 --> 01:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
the the I don't know the language uh
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative your bill I'm just trying
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
to remember the number but yes so in
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
that bill there's going to be an
 
01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:05.090 align:start position:0%
that bill there's going to be an
allocation

01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
allocation
 
01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:06.110 align:start position:0%
allocation
organization

01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
location specified in court order
 
01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:10.790 align:start position:0%
location specified in court order
placements

01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
placements
 
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
um that seems like a good place Mickey
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
have you been working on that so uh it
 
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a page number but I think
 
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
the the last page of the pay-per-clip
 
01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
pack that I passed out this morning I
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
got a memo from uh Rebecca Ross I hope
 
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
hope it's partier I think it is Rebecca
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
Ross who if you recall from Department
 
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services came and
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
spoke to us about this last week so she
 
01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
had thought you know just off the top of
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
her head it could be around two million
 
01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
dollars she went back and crunched the
 
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
numbers and you can see it's more like
 
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
four and then five million dollars in
 
01:19:41.930 --> 01:19:41.940 align:start position:0%
the next two years associated with house
 
01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
bill 521. so the the details that she
 
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
gave you there or they gave us there I
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
think it's in each of your packets so
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
yeah it's in line 168. so 168 in House
 
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 takes the traditional court
 
01:19:57.410 --> 01:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
ordered placements and moves that from
 
01:19:59.090 --> 01:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
the general fund to the education trust
 
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
fund so just to explain what quarter
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
Replacements are for you so I mean these
 
01:20:03.950 --> 01:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
are basically students who are
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
adjudicated by the court system and the
 
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
court places them in a particular
 
01:20:09.649 --> 01:20:09.659 align:start position:0%
education setting could be it's a new
 
01:20:10.729 --> 01:20:10.739 align:start position:0%
new center or it could be some other
 
01:20:10.739 --> 01:20:12.050 align:start position:0%
new center or it could be some other
setting

01:20:12.050 --> 01:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
setting
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
um and by law we're required to pay for
 
01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
the cost of those and the way that that
 
01:20:18.410 --> 01:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
works is if we don't have enough money
 
01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
we just draw warrant and we're able to
 
01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
pay for them like there's no limitation
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
however the whatever the judge orders
 
01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:26.699 align:start position:0%
that's what we're required to pay and so
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
this has been moved from the general
 
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
fund down into the education trust fund
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
in this budget
 
01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
what was the bill number Mickey
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 521 thank you sorry too many
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
Bill numbers
 
01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
we're expanding this we're not actually
 
01:20:44.450 --> 01:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
expanding it like we generally are
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
paying about that amount so typically
 
01:20:47.630 --> 01:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
what happens since I've been here
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
through the last two couple biennium you
 
01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
know initially we were at one point we
 
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
would budget like 1.5 million
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
um and then we increased it to 2 million
 
01:20:58.130 --> 01:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
we've been spending more than that but
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
when you're passing a budget it's
 
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
General funds and so it's easier to pass
 
01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
it at 2 million and then I just have to
 
01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
draw a warrant for the excess anyway so
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't show up in the budget per se
 
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
um so we're just giving you the number
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
that we estimate what the cost will
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
actually be and then you'll appropriate
 
01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
whatever it is and then we're going to
 
01:21:14.209 --> 01:21:14.219 align:start position:0%
spend whatever we have if we were
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
expanding it to include more than just
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
court ordered correct 521 commissioner
 
01:21:21.649 --> 01:21:21.659 align:start position:0%
adds episode of treatment correct so and
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's the estimates that Ms Ross from
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
HHS has provided with associated with
 
01:21:28.209 --> 01:21:28.219 align:start position:0%
that bill okay
 
01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
so we were going to try to rename it as
 
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
well so okay court ordered and episodes
 
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
yeah and basically the the intent is to
 
01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
can I oh so and I just so then I'm just
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
going to clarify because I know I am
 
01:21:44.689 --> 01:21:44.699 align:start position:0%
familiar with this legislation and maybe
 
01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say what you were going to
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
say and I apologize
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
um but I mean essentially what in
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
addition to we've historically had the
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
quarter Replacements
 
01:21:53.630 --> 01:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
um but what happens is
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
um under the fast forward program dcyf
 
01:21:59.330 --> 01:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
is able to place students so a kid you
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
know calls in having a mental health
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
crisis it could be the rapid response
 
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
team that shows up at her house they
 
01:22:05.090 --> 01:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
could show up at one of our hospitals or
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital and the fast forward
 
01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
team puts them into a specific uh you
 
01:22:13.130 --> 01:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
know educational setting and so it's not
 
01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
just a court it's dcyf making those
 
01:22:17.689 --> 01:22:17.699 align:start position:0%
placements as well so we under this
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
program we would be required to pay for
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
that as well right correct and that was
 
01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill right I'm one of
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
the co-spons so that's not the prime
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor but
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
essentially the concept is that since
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
the you know the schools don't really
 
01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
have any control over that placement it
 
01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
is unreasonable to ask them to pay for
 
01:22:37.490 --> 01:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
it so it is an expansion it is very
 
01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
similar to the court order placement but
 
01:22:40.850 --> 01:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
it is through a different program and
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
what representative Heath was talking
 
01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
about is that we are trying to figure
 
01:22:46.729 --> 01:22:46.739 align:start position:0%
out the best way to the line item to put
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
the funds in not just the amount but
 
01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
where to put them in it does seem that
 
01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
since this entire statute you know works
 
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
the same way whether it's a quartered
 
01:22:57.050 --> 01:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
placement or a placement for an episode
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
of treatment that we could use the same
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
line item for both and just rename the
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
line item to you know court order or
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
episode of treatment
 
01:23:07.370 --> 01:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
you know and that's what we wanted to
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
hear from you whether you think that's
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
the good practice or we should maybe
 
01:23:12.410 --> 01:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
keep them as two separate line items and
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
then we'd have to change hb1 you know
 
01:23:17.149 --> 01:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
what what are your thoughts on this so I
 
01:23:19.130 --> 01:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
prefer having the transparency and the
 
01:23:20.570 --> 01:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
visibility into them because quarter
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
placement is separate from an episode of
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
treatment placement and one is driving
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
through the judicial system and others
 
01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
coming through Health and Human Services
 
01:23:28.850 --> 01:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
and I think it's important as the
 
01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
legislative body to monitor you know
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
what these different like to not
 
01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
commingle those and then we lose
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
visibility so
 
01:23:37.810 --> 01:23:37.820 align:start position:0%
so that would require
 
01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh what we could do is just add
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
a new accounting unit House Bill one
 
01:23:45.410 --> 01:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
yeah so I don't know if anyone's in the
 
01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
mood to flip their big book open but
 
01:23:48.530 --> 01:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
you'll see the court ordered placement
 
01:23:51.530 --> 01:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
account on page 1149 so we could set
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
something up similar to that to the
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
episode for the episode of treatment
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
payments if that works in the department
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.890 --> 01:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
it's budgeted as education trust funds
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
now for court ordered placements are
 
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
traditional so this gets back to the
 
01:24:09.290 --> 01:24:09.300 align:start position:0%
conversation it depends on what color of
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
the dollar is that you're going to do
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
with all these placement Appropriations
 
01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
and I'll take care of that
 
01:24:15.770 --> 01:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
when we get to that okay
 
01:24:18.290 --> 01:24:18.300 align:start position:0%
so I never meant to co-mingle the funds
 
01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
I wanted them to be two separate
 
01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:21.709 align:start position:0%
I wanted them to be two separate
entities

01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:24:24.410 --> 01:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
um but that kind of um
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
authorization seemed to work well that
 
01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
we could do the same kind of thing yeah
 
01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
I would think because it is a an
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
estimate you'd probably want similar
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
open Wars right actually the department
 
01:24:36.649 --> 01:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
that should how would you allocate for
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
this is not enough they have a mechanism
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
to draw it just don't necessarily go
 
01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
along with these recommended dollars
 
01:24:44.689 --> 01:24:44.699 align:start position:0%
these are what will budget if if the
 
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
committee wants to this is what will
 
01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
carry as a cost associated with House
 
01:24:49.610 --> 01:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
Bill 521 but they'll still have
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to cover extra yeah
 
01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
okay so just to clarify Mickey right now
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
the court order line item is 3015 the uh
 
01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
you know Port order placements you are
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
looking to create a 3016 or whatever the
 
01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
available code is that is consistent and
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
matches all the chart of account
 
01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
specifications that would be treated in
 
01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
the same type of legal fashion as this
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
where we attempt to budget the exact
 
01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
amount but we understand that we may not
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
know so we will leave the authority of
 
01:25:21.890 --> 01:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
the you know commissioner to draw as
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
needed because there is no way to
 
01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
accurately modulate this type of stuff
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
but I would appreciate it if instead of
 
01:25:30.169 --> 01:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
being a bit optimistic to pass a budget
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
and then knowing will overspend it later
 
01:25:34.189 --> 01:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
to try to do our best therefore to
 
01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
correctly estimate and put those numbers
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
in the budget in the first place and you
 
01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
know then we can miss high we can miss
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
low but I think that whatever number we
 
01:25:44.689 --> 01:25:44.699 align:start position:0%
put there should be our best estimate to
 
01:25:47.570 --> 01:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
you know what we believe that may be
 
01:25:49.729 --> 01:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
knowing that it's still a crap shoot at
 
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
the end of the day and we do the best we
 
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
can but so to throw that in there like
 
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
so we estimate that our quarter
 
01:25:56.090 --> 01:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
Replacements are going to be about four
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
and a half million dollars it looks like
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
the HHS is estimating you know between
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
three and five million dollars for the
 
01:26:05.149 --> 01:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
episode of treatment placement so you'd
 
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that you appropriate
 
01:26:08.450 --> 01:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
the equal amount so we'll be looking at
 
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
a Amendment
 
01:26:11.810 --> 01:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
we'll have a we'll have an amendment to
 
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 with all the content from
 
01:26:16.669 --> 01:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
521 okay as well as the statutory
 
01:26:19.129 --> 01:26:19.139 align:start position:0%
language required I think it's it's all
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
covered if I remember the bill just
 
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
added episode of treatment to the
 
01:26:24.110 --> 01:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
statute four quarter replacement so it
 
01:26:25.370 --> 01:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
probably already has that open one but
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
I'll double check that and then I'll
 
01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
build a house bill one account so you
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
can see the separate appropriation for
 
01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
the episode of treatment versus the
 
01:26:34.129 --> 01:26:34.139 align:start position:0%
court ordered we may not need a major
 
01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
Amendment because you know
 
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to need an amendment we'll
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
thank you can I can I just uh be this
 
01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
becomes permanent this is not for the
 
01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:48.300 align:start position:0%
biennium this is a permanent changer yes
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
anything is permanent but going forward
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
the expectation is that this continues
 
01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:55.139 align:start position:0%
on that's an understanding
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
I mean as long as like the fast forward
 
01:26:57.890 --> 01:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
placements in the episode treatment
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
placements take place what other item
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
would you want to
 
01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
is there any yeah there any other
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
specific items for me before I have to
 
01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:09.590 align:start position:0%
specific items for me before I have to
go

01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
um the source of funding we had talked
 
01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
about bringing it back to general fund
 
01:27:16.010 --> 01:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
or education trust I think right now I'm
 
01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
fine with the education trust we have
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
money um we might not in future years
 
01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
and I think another legislator could
 
01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
legislation uh yeah another session can
 
01:27:27.890 --> 01:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
change that agreed
 
01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:28.910 align:start position:0%
change that agreed
okay

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:27:31.850 --> 01:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
moving right along okay is there an item
 
01:27:33.649 --> 01:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
you'd like to discuss or are you all set
 
01:27:35.689 --> 01:27:35.699 align:start position:0%
I'm all set let me just go through my
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
other page quickly
 
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
have we spent enough time on so
 
01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
everybody understands the Sugar Hill
 
01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
right so I don't have to talk about that
 
01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:50.990 align:start position:0%
right so I don't have to talk about that
one

01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:54.169 --> 01:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
no I'm all set great thank you but
 
01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
before the commissioner heads out just
 
01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the very bottom of page two
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
the change to revenue distribution of
 
01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
bptbt between general fund and education
 
01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
trust fund which is something that you
 
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
know we were talking about not deciding
 
01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
anything today but I just wanted while
 
01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
he's here whether he has any thoughts on
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
you know those strategies of funding and
 
01:28:17.810 --> 01:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
you know any thoughts on that topic so
 
01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
the only thing I'll I'll say relative to
 
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
that and it's kind of following up for
 
01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
the previous conversation that we had
 
01:28:24.890 --> 01:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
when I was in this committee it's just
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
what we have is when these things were
 
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
set up we had funding sources that
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
inherently are growing right so if our
 
01:28:34.669 --> 01:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
as our economy grows and we expand more
 
01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
you're going to see an increase in the
 
01:28:39.709 --> 01:28:39.719 align:start position:0%
the uh the funding that comes in
 
01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
um inherently my population of students
 
01:28:44.450 --> 01:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
is going to contract and get smaller and
 
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
so those two are going to probably
 
01:28:48.129 --> 01:28:48.139 align:start position:0%
continue to diverge so as you consider
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
how you put funds into that education
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
trust fund we want to try and balance
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
based on what we think the needs are
 
01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
going to be and those needs are going to
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
be based upon the numbers of students as
 
01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
well as the programs that you decide to
 
01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
fund out of there but I think the
 
01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
governor's budget reduced it to 65
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
percent of previous numbers yeah the the
 
01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget changes
 
01:29:11.450 --> 01:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
the business tax allocation to 65.35
 
01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
which over the biennium is about 150
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars of Revenue that would go
 
01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
from so that it would go to the general
 
01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
fund versus the education trust fund and
 
01:29:22.129 --> 01:29:22.139 align:start position:0%
you do see that adjustment on lines 15
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
and 16 on that uh schedule uh the house
 
01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
the on page six the education trust fund
 
01:29:29.709 --> 01:29:29.719 align:start position:0%
schedule okay
 
01:29:32.110 --> 01:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
we still want to hear from me anymore
 
01:29:35.629 --> 01:29:35.639 align:start position:0%
you're on a roll I can't help myself
 
01:29:38.330 --> 01:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
um this is an anomaly though this year
 
01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:39.470 align:start position:0%
um this is an anomaly though this year
well

01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
the last few sessions for us to have the
 
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
amount of funding that is in the
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
education trust we're going to be
 
01:29:50.330 --> 01:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
heading into a recession
 
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
um I think you know we've all been
 
01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
watching the news about what's happening
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
to the banks there are some concerns
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
about what's going on my my concern is
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
that um by limiting the amount of money
 
01:30:03.709 --> 01:30:03.719 align:start position:0%
going into the education trust we might
 
01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
be short shirting ourselves in case of a
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
recession and we'll end up
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
but we have the authority to take money
 
01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
from the general fund
 
01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
um so that's there but I just want to go
 
01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
on the record as uncomfortable with
 
01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
doing this thank you very much
 
01:30:24.770 --> 01:30:24.780 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you
 
01:30:27.169 --> 01:30:27.179 align:start position:0%
commissioner okay Caitlin back in the
 
01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
hot seat
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
8165 167. so building either they acted
 
01:30:46.189 --> 01:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:48.290 --> 01:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
so building it to this point the
 
01:30:50.930 --> 01:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
committee has decided to remove the 75
 
01:30:52.729 --> 01:30:52.739 align:start position:0%
million dollar transfer to the new
 
01:30:54.770 --> 01:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
building Aid fund I don't know if you
 
01:30:56.209 --> 01:30:56.219 align:start position:0%
have any questions for the Department
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
relative to the amounts that are in
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill one for new projects there's
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
still about 46 or 48 million dollars in
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
house bill one four new projects for
 
01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
this biennium uh I think they had spoke
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
to that last time they were in but I
 
01:31:11.689 --> 01:31:11.699 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have any other
 
01:31:14.330 --> 01:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
follow-ups relative to building Aid no
 
01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
just a reminder that is the tail The
 
01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
Debt Service and then money for new
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
projects as well right
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
I would like to um
 
01:31:25.729 --> 01:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
in that we still have remaining funds in
 
01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
the trust I would like to be able to add
 
01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
to the existing dollars in building Aid
 
01:31:38.209 --> 01:31:38.219 align:start position:0%
so that we could cover at least five to
 
01:31:40.370 --> 01:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
six projects and I know that Concord is
 
01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
a big one so maybe it would just be
 
01:31:43.610 --> 01:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
adding Concord
 
01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
um in this biennium if that would be a
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
possibility for us to consider thank you
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair it was like 37 million wasn't
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.129 --> 01:32:01.139 align:start position:0%
so if I could ask
 
01:32:03.410 --> 01:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
I know that you told us when you gave us
 
01:32:05.570 --> 01:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
that summary that those are the requests
 
01:32:08.330 --> 01:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
and I understand that but it looks to me
 
01:32:10.490 --> 01:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
like it should be possible to prepare
 
01:32:15.169 --> 01:32:15.179 align:start position:0%
for us a if not fully accurate a much
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
closer to reality estimate of what money
 
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
may they may end up being eligible for
 
01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
based on their number of students and
 
01:32:24.770 --> 01:32:24.780 align:start position:0%
square footage and cost per square foot
 
01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
would it be possible for the committee
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
to receive an updated you know summary
 
01:32:31.970 --> 01:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
which contains that estimate rather than
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
the current yes way over you know
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
requests because it's kind of hard to
 
01:32:38.689 --> 01:32:38.699 align:start position:0%
decide if you know where so far off the
 
01:32:40.490 --> 01:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
Mark we're in the process of going
 
01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
through and doing that calculation I
 
01:32:44.090 --> 01:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
think we are down to number five on the
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
list which is Litchfield so we can give
 
01:32:47.209 --> 01:32:47.219 align:start position:0%
you at least the first five updated to
 
01:32:49.010 --> 01:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
give you what that number is um maybe
 
01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to have a few more
 
01:32:53.209 --> 01:32:53.219 align:start position:0%
maybe even if it's a ballpark we're not
 
01:32:54.649 --> 01:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
looking for something that would be
 
01:32:57.169 --> 01:32:57.179 align:start position:0%
binding to those you know just the
 
01:33:00.410 --> 01:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
closer estimate that's all I'm asking so
 
01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
um it takes a lot of time for the
 
01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
Department to do that estimate
 
01:33:06.590 --> 01:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
um so where that's where she's in the
 
01:33:07.850 --> 01:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
process doing is going through and
 
01:33:09.410 --> 01:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
reviewing all of the expenses and
 
01:33:10.850 --> 01:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
determining what they are and are not
 
01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
eligible for so that's
 
01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
she can't rush it so she's gotten done
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
at least five maybe six or seven it
 
01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
depends on really how much time so
 
01:33:22.370 --> 01:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
um I will get the updated numbers with
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
those numbers knowing that the schools
 
01:33:27.890 --> 01:33:27.900 align:start position:0%
still do have the ability to ask for
 
01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
waivers and then and whatnot but I can
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
get you the the first five thank you
 
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
just looking for better quality data
 
01:33:36.050 --> 01:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
understanding it's not gonna be perfect
 
01:33:38.090 --> 01:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
but anything that improves the quality
 
01:33:40.129 --> 01:33:40.139 align:start position:0%
of the data would be welcome and as
 
01:33:42.110 --> 01:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
those things get updated if you could
 
01:33:45.169 --> 01:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
just keep updating us throughout without
 
01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
us having to ask anytime you know a new
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
school is done if you could update that
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
and send it to us I know that we don't
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
have a lot of time but you know it's
 
01:33:57.050 --> 01:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of variability in that
 
01:33:59.570 --> 01:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
data and we understand that so it's I
 
01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
think that would give us an opportunity
 
01:34:04.129 --> 01:34:04.139 align:start position:0%
to allocate more funding and so just a
 
01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
reminder that there's a cap in law of 50
 
01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:08.219 align:start position:0%
million dollars so all you would need to
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
do is do a removal of that cap one time
 
01:34:12.530 --> 01:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
which I believe you did in House Bill 2
 
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
for this fiscal year I think or fiscal
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
year 22. so you would just remove that
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
cap and then appropriate whatever you
 
01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
want to appropriate okay I understand
 
01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
what you're saying yeah
 
01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:24.290 align:start position:0%
what you're saying yeah
yeah

01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
right well we well we got 227 million
 
01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of asks you know to for
 
01:34:33.530 --> 01:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
building Aid and we seem so we never
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
cover what three out of 17 I mean that's
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
so maybe we ought to change think the
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
way we change uh we got some I think
 
01:34:42.169 --> 01:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
that's nice
 
01:34:46.010 --> 01:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
I mean well it's I mean we can't fund
 
01:34:47.930 --> 01:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
them all but so somebody's gonna get
 
01:34:50.330 --> 01:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
cheated out of the system so maybe we
 
01:34:52.970 --> 01:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
should Target Aid to all schools
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
and let it go with that and then and
 
01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
then have it in that fund uh Kappa
 
01:34:59.629 --> 01:34:59.639 align:start position:0%
Reserve fund more to fall
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry over to follow won't fall
 
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
right no and there's more to follow on
 
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
that discussion right right well I mean
 
01:35:08.209 --> 01:35:08.219 align:start position:0%
that's maybe we should head in that
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
direction and the tail we go where we
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
got to take there already in a minute
 
01:35:15.770 --> 01:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
drafted Oh okay very good thank you yes
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
but Mr chair thank you
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
I will perseverate on my same comment
 
01:35:24.169 --> 01:35:24.179 align:start position:0%
that I continue with school districts
 
01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
have been on a moratorium for 10 years
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
um there are projects that have gone
 
01:35:30.719 --> 01:35:32.390 align:start position:0%
um there are projects that have gone
unfunded

01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
um there are we saw with my Cahill's
 
01:35:37.610 --> 01:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
Bill we know we couldn't go back and do
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
retroactive but we have an opportunity
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
we have some money right now if we only
 
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
if we can fund put a few more projects
 
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
in and for this session I know you're
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
thinking about changing the manner in
 
01:35:52.370 --> 01:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
which building Aid is going to go out
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
but just for this biennium if we could
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
at least look at putting a few more
 
01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
dollars in building Aid well more than a
 
01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
few more Millions I should say just so
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
that we can fund
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
um a few more of those projects that
 
01:36:07.729 --> 01:36:07.739 align:start position:0%
have been on the waiting list and have
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
gone through the process with Amy and
 
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
have been vetted thoroughly that um we
 
01:36:17.209 --> 01:36:17.219 align:start position:0%
could get them into the works just now
 
01:36:19.490 --> 01:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
and I know you're we're talking about
 
01:36:20.810 --> 01:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
other things
 
01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
but just for this now that we have
 
01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
funding in the education trust that we
 
01:36:27.169 --> 01:36:27.179 align:start position:0%
could do this now I think that's our
 
01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
intent oh thank you
 
01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
of course yeah thank you I guess just I
 
01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
don't want a little clarification yet
 
01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:35.090 align:start position:0%
don't want a little clarification yet
again

01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
um it seemed our goal was to try to get
 
01:36:38.570 --> 01:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
more building Aid in this biennium which
 
01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
is why we moved that other the funds up
 
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
a little bit and
 
01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:43.970 align:start position:0%
a little bit and
um

01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
I guess I still would like to see I
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
guess I would like a recap of where we
 
01:36:48.649 --> 01:36:48.659 align:start position:0%
are on that an apropos what
 
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
representative Heath was saying uh there
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
may be new methods or methodologies to
 
01:36:55.729 --> 01:36:55.739 align:start position:0%
consider with regards to building aid
 
01:36:58.370 --> 01:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
but I think that's a longer and larger
 
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
conversation with regards to unintended
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
consequences and if I can just point out
 
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
the discussion we had last week about
 
01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
the accounting plans that were thrown in
 
01:37:08.330 --> 01:37:08.340 align:start position:0%
and caused a huge uptick and a great
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
deal of extra work on people I think
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
before we do anything there needs to be
 
01:37:15.169 --> 01:37:15.179 align:start position:0%
a good long conversation about what with
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
um Department of Education about what
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
those unintended consequences are so I
 
01:37:21.649 --> 01:37:21.659 align:start position:0%
am very leery about any major change at
 
01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
this point for that reason I can pretty
 
01:37:24.890 --> 01:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
much guarantee there will be unintended
 
01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
consequences if we don't do our due
 
01:37:29.209 --> 01:37:29.219 align:start position:0%
diligence first and that we've this is a
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
great opportunity to get some of this
 
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
money directly out to some of the
 
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
schools who have been waiting for a long
 
01:37:35.689 --> 01:37:35.699 align:start position:0%
time to do a building project thank you
 
01:37:38.570 --> 01:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
I agree
 
01:37:40.729 --> 01:37:40.739 align:start position:0%
well we're kind of in a holding pattern
 
01:37:43.310 --> 01:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:53.930 --> 01:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I didn't have the department
 
01:37:56.330 --> 01:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
prepared to dive into adequacy today I
 
01:37:57.709 --> 01:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
didn't think we were going to have time
 
01:37:59.629 --> 01:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
or I didn't think that conversation was
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
ready for any other items on here that
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
we could
 
01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:10.610 --> 01:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
conference to Charter Schools so
 
01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:12.610 align:start position:0%
conference to Charter Schools so
um

01:38:12.610 --> 01:38:12.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:16.330 --> 01:38:16.340 align:start position:0%
178 gives the department flexibility to
 
01:38:19.850 --> 01:38:19.860 align:start position:0%
make changes and and go to fiscal to ask
 
01:38:23.570 --> 01:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
for additional funding if we are in
 
01:38:25.250 --> 01:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
violation of our maintenance of effort
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
relative to our some of the federal
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
stimulus education programs that are
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
going on right now we are still in a
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
holding pattern with the U.S Department
 
01:38:34.610 --> 01:38:34.620 align:start position:0%
of Education to find out if we would
 
01:38:36.169 --> 01:38:36.179 align:start position:0%
potentially be in a violation of the
 
01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort this is carryover
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
language from the last biennium so
 
01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
basically the legislature said you know
 
01:38:44.330 --> 01:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
if the U.S Department of Education
 
01:38:46.970 --> 01:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
determines that you're in violation
 
01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
um you we will give you at least the
 
01:38:51.290 --> 01:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
flexibility to come to us to ask for
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
more money so that's all we're asking is
 
01:38:55.970 --> 01:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
to continue to hold for that language as
 
01:38:57.770 --> 01:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
we're still kind of in that holding
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
pattern and then the one changes we did
 
01:39:02.330 --> 01:39:02.340 align:start position:0%
note that last time we had only
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
specified for district schools and we
 
01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
needed to add in the chartered Public
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
Schools as well because those those
 
01:39:10.729 --> 01:39:10.739 align:start position:0%
schools also receive stimulus funding so
 
01:39:13.010 --> 01:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
that's all that that language is doing
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
is just updating that that Charter
 
01:39:16.250 --> 01:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
School language and continuing forward
 
01:39:18.110 --> 01:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
that language to give us the flexibility
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
to go to fiscal if it's if it's needed
 
01:39:21.770 --> 01:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
from usdoe
 
01:39:23.930 --> 01:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
okay second
 
01:39:29.090 --> 01:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
get all those in favor of section 178.
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
can I just ask a quick question to
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
Caitlin is that that uh chapter law so
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
if you look on here I know there's a
 
01:39:42.770 --> 01:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
type of drafting error if you look on
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
page 68 line 28 it says amend session
 
01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
law 220 or 2001 it was actually session
 
01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
lot 2021 so we could clean that up I
 
01:39:55.610 --> 01:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
just want to confirm is that the
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance of equity Authority that you
 
01:39:58.970 --> 01:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
have for the biennium only last year it
 
01:40:00.410 --> 01:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
would only be needed for the biennium
 
01:40:02.209 --> 01:40:02.219 align:start position:0%
because I think the federal law is only
 
01:40:06.590 --> 01:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
looking at those two years okay so
 
01:40:08.330 --> 01:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if we would need the
 
01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
authority to go back if we should
 
01:40:11.330 --> 01:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
clarify that but the calculation is
 
01:40:14.570 --> 01:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
relative to the 22 and 23 school years
 
01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:15.950 align:start position:0%
relative to the 22 and 23 school years
okay

01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:40:17.450 --> 01:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
no I think I think we're good with this
 
01:40:19.970 --> 01:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
you can accept this as is I'll clean up
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
that uh that typographical error on line
 
01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.510 align:start position:0%
that uh that typographical error on line
28.

01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
28.
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
any other items you're comfortable
 
01:40:27.770 --> 01:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
bringing forward
 
01:40:29.209 --> 01:40:29.219 align:start position:0%
we're going to get her done to kind of
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
move today I see that and I appreciate
 
01:40:31.199 --> 01:40:32.030 align:start position:0%
move today I see that and I appreciate
it

01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:40:34.129 --> 01:40:34.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:41.090 --> 01:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:43.129 --> 01:40:43.139 align:start position:0%
questions about the Medicaid directory
 
01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
that's listed here Mickey is that
 
01:40:50.090 --> 01:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
on what I'm sorry
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
no no I think we talked that one to
 
01:40:54.480 --> 01:41:02.570 align:start position:0%
no no I think we talked that one to
death

01:41:02.570 --> 01:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:09.169 --> 01:41:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:13.070 --> 01:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
right right okay yeah
 
01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
can I ask about the cap again I mean I
 
01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
know building a we need to wait on
 
01:41:19.610 --> 01:41:19.620 align:start position:0%
um is a decision about removing the cap
 
01:41:21.770 --> 01:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
for the biennium part of that discussion
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:47.390 align:start position:0%
 
correct

01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:55.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:41:55.370 --> 01:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
well I don't know if I just messed
 
01:41:58.729 --> 01:41:58.739 align:start position:0%
something up there's a little dial that
 
01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
so was it on the page oh sorry on page
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
three line 43 when Caitlyn was with us
 
01:42:15.169 --> 01:42:15.179 align:start position:0%
Friday she discussed the public school
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so that's still appending
 
01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:18.719 align:start position:0%
the five million dollars a year relative
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
to that request I don't know if you have
 
01:42:22.850 --> 01:42:22.860 align:start position:0%
any more follow-up questions for for
 
01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn we we dove into that last week
 
01:42:29.330 --> 01:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
if not we can move on to the
 
01:42:32.090 --> 01:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
okay you go with that the accountability
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
position I think that request will go
 
01:42:35.689 --> 01:42:35.699 align:start position:0%
away as well based on the conversation
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
that we had as far as repealing the
 
01:42:39.050 --> 01:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
accountability plans relative to the
 
01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant so as part of
 
01:42:44.209 --> 01:42:44.219 align:start position:0%
this committee's adequacy amendment
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
however big or small that is that'll be
 
01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
part of that okay and then that brings
 
01:42:52.850 --> 01:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
us to lines 45 through 48 which tie to
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
those two schedules that I just provided
 
01:42:56.330 --> 01:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
and the department can speak to the
 
01:42:57.890 --> 01:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
requests as a position I do want to
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
clarify one thing was as far as adequacy
 
01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
and whatnot is that there is a version
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
of a bill that came from the house that
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
has accountability plans tied to relief
 
01:43:10.490 --> 01:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
Aid too so if you keep accountability
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
plans and relief Aid then it would also
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
need or the Sally fellows bill
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
right so I'm saying so that position
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
would be needed for that if you were to
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
establish that too so we'll be back to
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
that kind of circular conversation just
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
keep that language it's abolish of
 
01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:33.410 align:start position:0%
keep that language it's abolish of
everywhere

01:43:33.410 --> 01:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
so and then
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
so the yeah so did I mean did the
 
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
committee continue to have questions
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
from the conversation we were having
 
01:43:43.609 --> 01:43:43.619 align:start position:0%
last week relative to the positions
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
you know we kind of discussed them last
 
01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:51.830 align:start position:0%
you know we kind of discussed them last
week

01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:55.490 --> 01:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
but these are not in hb2 HP one
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
so that this would be an increase to our
 
01:44:00.590 --> 01:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation in hb1 for General funds
 
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
for these various different lines
 
01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
relative to increases across the
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
department relative to hiring needs the
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
department has done in fiscal year 23 it
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
will have impacts on 24 and 25. okay I
 
01:44:15.530 --> 01:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:18.290 --> 01:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
just I just was going to say that we did
 
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
follow up you know at the end of the
 
01:44:21.169 --> 01:44:21.179 align:start position:0%
meeting because I wasn't sure during
 
01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
that original discussion why they were
 
01:44:25.129 --> 01:44:25.139 align:start position:0%
not included and it was made clear that
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
the timing of the budget process made it
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
impossible for this to be caught in the
 
01:44:31.129 --> 01:44:31.139 align:start position:0%
budget so I'm completely satisfied that
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
you know this is the best we can do it
 
01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
you know approve them at this time and
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
they are needed positions so I'm 100
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
fine with this these were not in the
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
governor's budget they were not in the
 
01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
governor's budget now
 
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
the positions themselves were the the
 
01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
hiring decisions have been made in the
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
last several months since we last
 
01:44:51.290 --> 01:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
updated the numbers for the Governor's
 
01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
budget Mary I think this is kind of a
 
01:44:55.970 --> 01:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
simple conversation it's simply a matter
 
01:44:59.390 --> 01:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
of the individuals who were hired to
 
01:45:01.729 --> 01:45:01.739 align:start position:0%
fill those positions came in at a much
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
higher rate correct than was budgeted I
 
01:45:07.129 --> 01:45:07.139 align:start position:0%
think the state maybe ought to change
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
that how they budget positions
 
01:45:12.890 --> 01:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
um because this is a direct cause of
 
01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:14.030 align:start position:0%
um because this is a direct cause of
that

01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
um so it's an adjustment based on the
 
01:45:18.290 --> 01:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
new hirees
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
and in order to meet their budget they
 
01:45:22.669 --> 01:45:22.679 align:start position:0%
need to make these adjustments am I
 
01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
correct correct
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
so what uh
 
01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
what's the motion on this one so you can
 
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
accept the changes in these two sheets
 
01:45:33.229 --> 01:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
it'll uh it'll be a cost of about a
 
01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars in general funds and we
 
01:45:38.209 --> 01:45:38.219 align:start position:0%
would add 190 000 in federal as well to
 
01:45:39.410 --> 01:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
the budget that would all be in house
 
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
bill one okay
 
01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:53.629 align:start position:0%
 
unanimous

01:45:53.629 --> 01:45:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
and on page four of this document uh I
 
01:45:58.490 --> 01:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
don't know if the department has any
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
thoughts on line 63 relative to the bill
 
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
to appropriate money to codify the
 
01:46:06.890 --> 01:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
education laws and rules as well as line
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
69 which was House Bill 542 that
 
01:46:10.850 --> 01:46:10.860 align:start position:0%
established the new data analyst
 
01:46:10.860 --> 01:46:12.109 align:start position:0%
established the new data analyst
position

01:46:12.109 --> 01:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
so this committee will remember about a
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
month or two ago I testified on that
 
01:46:18.050 --> 01:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
bill um that was a bill that I had
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
worked on with representative Greg Hill
 
01:46:23.090 --> 01:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
um for the recodification anyways
 
01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:23.810 align:start position:0%
um for the recodification anyways
um

01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:23.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:25.970 --> 01:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
we have had you know continue to have
 
01:46:27.169 --> 01:46:27.179 align:start position:0%
conversations I know people have
 
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
continued to do research
 
01:46:31.250 --> 01:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
um I think that the general consensus
 
01:46:33.890 --> 01:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
across the board from everybody on
 
01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
whatever side of the political fence is
 
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
that the education rules do certainly
 
01:46:38.810 --> 01:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
need to be looked at potentially
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
re-codified I think there are some
 
01:46:43.490 --> 01:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
concerns maybe relative to the process
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
and the costs
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
um you know the point of the bill was
 
01:46:51.050 --> 01:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
really to start having that conversation
 
01:46:53.149 --> 01:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like this is not going to
 
01:46:55.010 --> 01:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
be enough money which we anticipated
 
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
that originally we just kind of put
 
01:46:58.490 --> 01:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
something down
 
01:47:00.890 --> 01:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
um but something we are at a point where
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
something needs to be done about the
 
01:47:05.149 --> 01:47:05.159 align:start position:0%
education laws rewriting them in
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
complete kind of form so that we're not
 
01:47:10.010 --> 01:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
just doing this one-off piece by piece
 
01:47:12.109 --> 01:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
so I spoke to resident Hill on Friday
 
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
about this and he indicated somebody was
 
01:47:18.050 --> 01:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
was supposed to have given me a number
 
01:47:19.609 --> 01:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
and I don't know who I don't remember
 
01:47:21.410 --> 01:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
who he said
 
01:47:23.810 --> 01:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
but apparently there's some activity
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
still going on but we don't have any
 
01:47:30.649 --> 01:47:30.659 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah but let's see what that number
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
ultimately is because if it's like 10
 
01:47:34.010 --> 01:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
million dollars we'll say well that's
 
01:47:36.169 --> 01:47:36.179 align:start position:0%
big number I I might suggest
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
um maybe rewriting this language to be
 
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
something like
 
01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
um require the department to put out an
 
01:47:43.850 --> 01:47:43.860 align:start position:0%
RFP to do the work and then come to
 
01:47:46.010 --> 01:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
fiscal with the amount in the RFP to
 
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
determine if that amount is reasonable
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
or not I that works I I would probably
 
01:47:52.850 --> 01:47:52.860 align:start position:0%
support something like that because
 
01:47:55.250 --> 01:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
honestly this is not going to work the
 
01:47:56.689 --> 01:47:56.699 align:start position:0%
weight Street and I appreciate the
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
intent but I could argue that this is
 
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
either way too low for what you really
 
01:48:03.590 --> 01:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
need to do and way too high for what you
 
01:48:05.930 --> 01:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
can do so this is just
 
01:48:08.750 --> 01:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know a conversation starter but
 
01:48:10.609 --> 01:48:10.619 align:start position:0%
getting an RFP at least brings this to
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal who can say yay nay or cut it
 
01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
down and just start the process so I
 
01:48:16.729 --> 01:48:16.739 align:start position:0%
would totally authorize the department
 
01:48:19.490 --> 01:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
to put an RFP out and go to fiscal as
 
01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:22.739 align:start position:0%
suggested and take it from there so then
 
01:48:26.050 --> 01:48:26.060 align:start position:0%
the the what we would do is we would
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
amend that bill no we'll put it just put
 
01:48:31.790 --> 01:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
a dash B2 yeah yeah okay
 
01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:32.930 align:start position:0%
a dash B2 yeah yeah okay
Mary

01:48:32.930 --> 01:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
Mary
 
01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:33.830 align:start position:0%
Mary
um

01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:35.699 align:start position:0%
I think we also talked a lot about this
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
is happening across the state with
 
01:48:40.189 --> 01:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
regard to lots of different departments
 
01:48:40.199 --> 01:48:41.750 align:start position:0%
regard to lots of different departments
so

01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:45.290 --> 01:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
um could this be more of a overall
 
01:48:47.629 --> 01:48:47.639 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed being the first one to
 
01:48:50.450 --> 01:48:50.460 align:start position:0%
do this to establish the protocol
 
01:48:54.530 --> 01:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
by which the recodification of statutes
 
01:48:57.169 --> 01:48:57.179 align:start position:0%
could be affected
 
01:48:57.179 --> 01:48:58.070 align:start position:0%
could be affected
um

01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that makes sense and I
 
01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
think from our work session on this we
 
01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
there was discussion whether this should
 
01:49:05.890 --> 01:49:05.900 align:start position:0%
be a well yeah a Department of Education
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
initiation or office of legislative
 
01:49:11.450 --> 01:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
services and we had director alaconis in
 
01:49:13.250 --> 01:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
here if you recall so perhaps
 
01:49:15.050 --> 01:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
representative Hill was referring to
 
01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:17.639 align:start position:0%
director alaconis relative to maybe
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
working on some information relative to
 
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
this bill and I can check with them but
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
I think to Mary's point if we if we
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
take pistol
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
general not just Department of Education
 
01:49:30.590 --> 01:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
but any Department
 
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
authorize the department to get an RFP
 
01:49:35.330 --> 01:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
and take it to fiscal
 
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
that would help Department
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
transportation could help safety could
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
help and that's uh and perhaps we run it
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
by director alaconis because it may make
 
01:49:47.209 --> 01:49:47.219 align:start position:0%
more sense for one person or one office
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
to do that for all versus it just
 
01:49:51.590 --> 01:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
scattered around state government fine
 
01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:53.639 align:start position:0%
so maybe we'll touch base with him to
 
01:49:55.669 --> 01:49:55.679 align:start position:0%
see if he has any information okay I
 
01:49:58.669 --> 01:49:58.679 align:start position:0%
don't know if Charlie arlinghaus needs
 
01:50:00.530 --> 01:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
to be part of that conversation because
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
it kind of impacts the whole the way the
 
01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
state works
 
01:50:07.010 --> 01:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
so I don't know just adding that well
 
01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that actually do all
 
01:50:10.129 --> 01:50:10.139 align:start position:0%
the contract review I'm sure director
 
01:50:12.590 --> 01:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
aluconis will uh you know follow up with
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
Mr Arlington House or anybody else who
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
they should follow up I mean he would
 
01:50:17.930 --> 01:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
know who to talk to to give us the
 
01:50:21.530 --> 01:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
I don't think as anybody that has said
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
there's no point in doing this
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
every time I've heard somebody talk
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:32.450 --> 01:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
people who never read the statutes May
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
disagree but when you actually try to
 
01:50:37.310 --> 01:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
read the Mia it's uh right any other
 
01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:38.870 align:start position:0%
read the Mia it's uh right any other
items

01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
items
 
01:50:40.570 --> 01:50:40.580 align:start position:0%
um so there's other position
 
01:50:45.229 --> 01:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
HB 542 new doe data analyst position
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
so this position was something that
 
01:50:50.450 --> 01:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd had put in
 
01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:52.679 align:start position:0%
um it's uh unique that the New Hampshire
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Education does not have a
 
01:50:57.890 --> 01:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
a research and data analyst arm most
 
01:50:59.570 --> 01:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
Department of educations I think have a
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
relatively large one and representative
 
01:51:04.669 --> 01:51:04.679 align:start position:0%
Ladd was
 
01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
really it came out of Representative lad
 
01:51:07.729 --> 01:51:07.739 align:start position:0%
was at the Department of Education
 
01:51:10.669 --> 01:51:10.679 align:start position:0%
asking for people to do X Y and Z and I
 
01:51:12.050 --> 01:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
had said well we don't have staff that
 
01:51:14.570 --> 01:51:14.580 align:start position:0%
are dedicated to doing that and if you
 
01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
wanted that to be a function because you
 
01:51:17.930 --> 01:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
wanted some reports he wanted some
 
01:51:19.490 --> 01:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
substantial data data analysis on
 
01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:20.510 align:start position:0%
substantial data data analysis on
education

01:51:20.510 --> 01:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:51:22.370 --> 01:51:22.380 align:start position:0%
just using our statistics I said you
 
01:51:23.570 --> 01:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
know if you really want this on an
 
01:51:24.890 --> 01:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis and the committee is
 
01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
wanting these support and whatnot then
 
01:51:27.950 --> 01:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
there should be a position established
 
01:51:29.870 --> 01:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
full-time and he said yes and I want
 
01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
that position and that because I want
 
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
he wants the results of of that so I
 
01:51:37.370 --> 01:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
like that motion based on our previous
 
01:51:39.169 --> 01:51:39.179 align:start position:0%
conversation this is a much needed
 
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
position our second emotion since this
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
is a 20-0 billion committee that passed
 
01:51:45.770 --> 01:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
on conduct consent calendar I mean we
 
01:51:49.129 --> 01:51:49.139 align:start position:0%
got a funded period end of story
 
01:51:50.689 --> 01:51:50.699 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at Mickey because he's the
 
01:51:52.490 --> 01:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
manicus it's all done yep so we'll put
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
this in House Bill 2 uh it's up to the
 
01:51:58.010 --> 01:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
committee whether you want to fund this
 
01:51:59.689 --> 01:51:59.699 align:start position:0%
position and the budget or just put as
 
01:52:01.370 --> 01:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
an out as a house bill to appropriation
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
there's really no
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
right or wrong there we can keep it in
 
01:52:10.450 --> 01:52:10.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:19.490 --> 01:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.410 --> 01:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
we'll point out the bill appropriated
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
lower numbers and what the department is
 
01:52:25.310 --> 01:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
saying is the actual cost so the bill
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
appropriated 160 and 145 000
 
01:52:30.109 --> 01:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
respectively respectively for the next
 
01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
two years and you'll see on line 69
 
01:52:34.970 --> 01:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
there doe estimates 183 about per year
 
01:52:42.609 --> 01:52:42.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's uh this is an ed funding bill and
 
01:52:52.129 --> 01:52:52.139 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how much you want to get
 
01:52:55.010 --> 01:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
into that today oh okay yeah that one
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
that would see oh that's adequacy that's
 
01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
that adequate example correct I like 529
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
seems like everybody does
 
01:53:04.850 --> 01:53:04.860 align:start position:0%
so 529 maybe Caitlyn can speak to the
 
01:53:07.070 --> 01:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
components that it adds
 
01:53:10.189 --> 01:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
so so 529 keeps the formula the way it
 
01:53:12.649 --> 01:53:12.659 align:start position:0%
currently is um away it's uh it's
 
01:53:14.270 --> 01:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
different than the governor's proposal
 
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
so just a reminder on the governor's
 
01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
proposal the governor's proposal is
 
01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
really to simplify the adequacy formula
 
01:53:22.129 --> 01:53:22.139 align:start position:0%
um get rid of some of the
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
um other kind of pots of money and
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
expand base Aid and free and reduce
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
lunch annual increases to school and
 
01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:32.810 align:start position:0%
lunch annual increases to school and
then

01:53:32.810 --> 01:53:32.820 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:53:35.770 --> 01:53:35.780 align:start position:0%
um as hold harmlesses go away increase
 
01:53:38.689 --> 01:53:38.699 align:start position:0%
uh the extraordinary needs grants over
 
01:53:40.490 --> 01:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
time so that's what the governor's
 
01:53:44.570 --> 01:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
proposal does 529 is a different kind of
 
01:53:46.970 --> 01:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
funding proposal that leaves the base
 
01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
amounts the same leaves free and reduced
 
01:53:51.410 --> 01:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
lunch the same leaves third grade
 
01:53:54.530 --> 01:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
reading in the formula currently leaves
 
01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs grants in leave
 
01:53:58.250 --> 01:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
stabilization grants in leaves relief
 
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
Aid in and then adds fiscal capacity
 
01:54:03.709 --> 01:54:03.719 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid which is an old section of
 
01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
the formula that existed prior to 2012
 
01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
when it was removed in 2012 it is
 
01:54:13.850 --> 01:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
largely based on family median family
 
01:54:17.629 --> 01:54:17.639 align:start position:0%
income and equalized valuations and it
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
allocates approximately 100 million
 
01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
dollars of additional Aid to school
 
01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
districts across the state is that
 
01:54:25.629 --> 01:54:25.639 align:start position:0%
correct 100 that's fiscal note
 
01:54:29.090 --> 01:54:29.100 align:start position:0%
well just just one quick comment slash
 
01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
question here
 
01:54:31.199 --> 01:54:31.970 align:start position:0%
question here
um

01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:34.490 --> 01:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
I remember that during the original you
 
01:54:36.050 --> 01:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
know time when we when we had the public
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on the bill I did ask the prime
 
01:54:40.250 --> 01:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
to sponsor whether you know at the time
 
01:54:41.810 --> 01:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
when they designed it the governor
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
budget was not known so the bill is both
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
intending to change the way that it is
 
01:54:48.649 --> 01:54:48.659 align:start position:0%
allocated and to increase it the
 
01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
governor already increased Aid by a lot
 
01:54:54.050 --> 01:54:54.060 align:start position:0%
so I would like to you know see if you
 
01:54:57.410 --> 01:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts on uh you know
 
01:55:01.609 --> 01:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
which whether you know the increase in
 
01:55:04.250 --> 01:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
the bill is something that you know we
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
still need to add to the governor budget
 
01:55:07.970 --> 01:55:07.980 align:start position:0%
or not because I'm quite uncomfortable
 
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
with that but just trying to understand
 
01:55:12.530 --> 01:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on the bill both in terms
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
of the quality of the formula and in
 
01:55:16.729 --> 01:55:16.739 align:start position:0%
terms of the amount of additional
 
01:55:19.010 --> 01:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
funding now that we know the existing
 
01:55:20.450 --> 01:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
Governor budget because this was
 
01:55:22.129 --> 01:55:22.139 align:start position:0%
designed when the governor budget was
 
01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
not known the bill
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
that is correct I I think they're
 
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
this is probably not the answer the
 
01:55:30.169 --> 01:55:30.179 align:start position:0%
committee is going to want but the
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
formulas are just different and they do
 
01:55:33.290 --> 01:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
different things and so really what the
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
policy there are two separate policy
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
decisions that the legislature needs to
 
01:55:40.189 --> 01:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
decide which direction they're going in
 
01:55:42.410 --> 01:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
whether it's increasing base funding to
 
01:55:44.450 --> 01:55:44.460 align:start position:0%
all schools in the cost the
 
01:55:46.010 --> 01:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
Constitutional cost of an adequate
 
01:55:48.109 --> 01:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
education versus giving additional
 
01:55:50.689 --> 01:55:50.699 align:start position:0%
funding on the
 
01:55:52.189 --> 01:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
um quote-unquote right side of the
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
formula which is not part of a
 
01:55:56.270 --> 01:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional adequate education
 
01:55:59.570 --> 01:55:59.580 align:start position:0%
so those are two separate ideas that
 
01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:00.169 align:start position:0%
so those are two separate ideas that
um

01:56:00.169 --> 01:56:00.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:03.709 --> 01:56:03.719 align:start position:0%
that should be discussed just one quick
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up and that's a I'm new here
 
01:56:09.590 --> 01:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
question can you point out to me why the
 
01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
right hand side is the constitutional
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
eight and you know sorry the left hand
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
side is the Constitutional adequate
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
funding and the right hand is not
 
01:56:20.450 --> 01:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
because in my head everything is sent to
 
01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:23.639 align:start position:0%
the school is education Aid you know so
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
could you help me understand that of
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
course I don't have my wonderful law
 
01:56:28.790 --> 01:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
book in front of me but um rsa198 I
 
01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
think 40
 
01:56:32.930 --> 01:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
um defines what the Constitutional cost
 
01:56:34.729 --> 01:56:34.739 align:start position:0%
of an adequate education is and
 
01:56:36.590 --> 01:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
calculates the Constitutional cost of
 
01:56:39.050 --> 01:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
adequate education and just and that's
 
01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
what that amount is and then everything
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
else is an additional it's it's
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
confusing because it's called an
 
01:56:46.729 --> 01:56:46.739 align:start position:0%
adequate education grant but that is
 
01:56:48.890 --> 01:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
outside of the Constitutional obligated
 
01:56:50.689 --> 01:56:50.699 align:start position:0%
amount well that's why I'm asking
 
01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
because I'm a bit confused and
 
01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
clarification is welcome I appreciate it
 
01:56:55.850 --> 01:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
I'll continue to go offline especially
 
01:56:57.649 --> 01:56:57.659 align:start position:0%
just with the terminology being very
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
similar and kind of overlapping
 
01:57:01.910 --> 01:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you
 
01:57:05.870 --> 01:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
right uh thank you uh third graded uh
 
01:57:08.330 --> 01:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
reading uh how valuable do you think
 
01:57:10.490 --> 01:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
that how much effect does that have that
 
01:57:13.310 --> 01:57:13.320 align:start position:0%
money and if we take it away uh what's
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
that going to do so um the third grade
 
01:57:16.930 --> 01:57:16.940 align:start position:0%
reading money which I think
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
so I think it's approximately 1.5
 
01:57:21.770 --> 01:57:21.780 align:start position:0%
million dollars in the current Formula
 
01:57:24.530 --> 01:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
um and it goes to only about 15
 
01:57:27.890 --> 01:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
um 100 Kids uh because of the way the
 
01:57:30.050 --> 01:57:30.060 align:start position:0%
calculation is done
 
01:57:32.270 --> 01:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
um the third grade reading amount you
 
01:57:34.010 --> 01:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
are only eligible to receive that amount
 
01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
if you're also not free and reduced
 
01:57:38.810 --> 01:57:38.820 align:start position:0%
lunch special education or an English
 
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
language learner so there's
 
01:57:43.070 --> 01:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
approximately 6 500 kids that would
 
01:57:44.810 --> 01:57:44.820 align:start position:0%
actually be eligible for this aid but
 
01:57:46.370 --> 01:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
because of those additional kind of
 
01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
callers on the funding not everybody is
 
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
receiving that funding so if the funding
 
01:57:53.390 --> 01:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
is truly going to increase third grade
 
01:57:56.209 --> 01:57:56.219 align:start position:0%
reading there's a lot of kids that are
 
01:57:58.490 --> 01:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
not proficient that are not benefiting
 
01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
so if I if I may follow up do you think
 
01:58:10.490 --> 01:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
we uh it's not really effective I mean a
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
million and a half is I mean we're not
 
01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0%
we're helping them in other ways anyway
 
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
so so in the governor's proposal reduces
 
01:58:20.089 --> 01:58:20.099 align:start position:0%
that basically in that exact line of
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
thought that the funding could be used
 
01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:24.950 align:start position:0%
thought that the funding could be used
elsewhere

01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:27.709 --> 01:58:27.719 align:start position:0%
so we'll leave one on the table
 
01:58:30.530 --> 01:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
yeah I think Ed funding adequacy is
 
01:58:35.390 --> 01:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so anything else we can
 
01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
01:58:51.050 --> 01:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
enjoy today's snow
 
01:58:55.010 --> 01:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:56.570 --> 01:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
I got a feeling Mickey's got some other
 
01:58:59.149 --> 01:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
stuff for us yeah I do uh I'm gonna I'm
 
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
gonna pass something out real quick just
 
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
relative to 529 so very simply the
 
01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
current law includes two enhanced Aid
 
01:59:10.010 --> 01:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
grants as part of the Ed funding Formula
 
01:59:11.810 --> 01:59:11.820 align:start position:0%
One is based on free reduced lunch
 
01:59:13.850 --> 01:59:13.860 align:start position:0%
populations one is based on equalized
 
01:59:17.109 --> 01:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
valuation per pupil 529
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
introduces a new aid grant based on free
 
01:59:21.530 --> 01:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch populations and one based
 
01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:23.580 align:start position:0%
on equalized valuations per pupil it's
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
to me very duplicative so I'm going to
 
01:59:27.649 --> 01:59:27.659 align:start position:0%
provide the language that's in current
 
01:59:30.169 --> 01:59:30.179 align:start position:0%
law and the language that's in 529 just
 
01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
so you have it so you can see how
 
01:59:33.890 --> 01:59:33.900 align:start position:0%
similar you how similar The Proposal
 
01:59:36.370 --> 01:59:36.380 align:start position:0%
from the current life so it may be
 
01:59:40.450 --> 01:59:40.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:48.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:59:48.290 --> 01:59:48.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:59:50.330 --> 01:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
part of that conversation too Mr chair
 
01:59:50.340 --> 01:59:51.410 align:start position:0%
part of that conversation too Mr chair
could

01:59:51.410 --> 01:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:59:53.689 --> 01:59:53.699 align:start position:0%
I'm confused about the hold harmless in
 
01:59:58.490 --> 01:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
529 because I think the whole timeless
 
02:00:00.890 --> 02:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
um even though 529 does a number of
 
02:00:03.770 --> 02:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
things then whole time list also does
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
some things so how do those two interact
 
02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
and how do we end up I think my
 
02:00:14.270 --> 02:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
perception is that hold harmless is just
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
another name for uh yeah
 
02:00:22.609 --> 02:00:22.619 align:start position:0%
I mean it's it's the same thing
 
02:00:22.619 --> 02:00:23.870 align:start position:0%
I mean it's it's the same thing
well

02:00:23.870 --> 02:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:25.669 align:start position:0%
well
yeah

02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:00:27.530 --> 02:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
by me with one difference that
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
stabilization is designed was designed
 
02:00:31.370 --> 02:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
to be permanent while the whole harmless
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
is designed to be temporary and as the
 
02:00:36.589 --> 02:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
funding Rises old harmless should slowly
 
02:00:39.470 --> 02:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
well slowly or fast disappear right that
 
02:00:40.970 --> 02:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
to me that is the difference and that's
 
02:00:42.530 --> 02:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
why I'm gonna use different terms but
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:49.310 --> 02:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
if you will thank you
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
if you remember we would try we tried to
 
02:00:54.890 --> 02:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
reduce home hold harmless uh or
 
02:00:58.189 --> 02:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
stabilization uh what four percent
 
02:01:00.530 --> 02:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
per year for and then we got rid of it
 
02:01:02.990 --> 02:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
one two eight twenty eighteen so I mean
 
02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:03.890 align:start position:0%
one two eight twenty eighteen so I mean
it's

02:01:03.890 --> 02:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:01:06.770 --> 02:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
I I don't know why maybe somebody can
 
02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
answer that question I wasn't here well
 
02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:11.870 align:start position:0%
answer that question I wasn't here well
I

02:01:11.870 --> 02:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
make it you know why why I was taken
 
02:01:16.609 --> 02:01:16.619 align:start position:0%
away or just that was like legislative
 
02:01:19.070 --> 02:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
decision I can't speak to uh okay but
 
02:01:21.950 --> 02:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
yeah that was just the when the formula
 
02:01:24.250 --> 02:01:24.260 align:start position:0%
was redone
 
02:01:26.570 --> 02:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
2018-19 whatever that was the
 
02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:28.609 align:start position:0%
2018-19 whatever that was the
stabilization

02:01:28.609 --> 02:01:28.619 align:start position:0%
stabilization
 
02:01:30.589 --> 02:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
decrease was essentially repealed and
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
restored back to the full amount at that
 
02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
time when they did the formula I think
 
02:01:35.089 --> 02:01:35.099 align:start position:0%
I've said this before you're probably
 
02:01:37.430 --> 02:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
sick of hearing it the last time the
 
02:01:39.530 --> 02:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
education funding formula was the same
 
02:01:41.450 --> 02:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
statutorily for two consecutive years
 
02:01:44.990 --> 02:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
was fiscal 12 and 13. so every single
 
02:01:46.490 --> 02:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
year since then it's been a different
 
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
way of calculating it funding so
 
02:01:51.050 --> 02:01:51.060 align:start position:0%
it's hard to remember each year why a
 
02:01:52.669 --> 02:01:52.679 align:start position:0%
change was made and what that change was
 
02:01:52.679 --> 02:01:53.810 align:start position:0%
change was made and what that change was
but

02:01:53.810 --> 02:01:53.820 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:55.310 align:start position:0%
but
okay

02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:01:56.990 --> 02:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
looks like you've got some videos I do
 
02:01:59.209 --> 02:01:59.219 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna kind of go we're gonna be all
 
02:02:00.890 --> 02:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
over the place a little bit try to get
 
02:02:03.050 --> 02:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
as much done today as we can uh first
 
02:02:05.149 --> 02:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
things first house bill 129 relative to
 
02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
the hygiene products I had that
 
02:02:07.850 --> 02:02:07.860 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay I think we just want to
 
02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
take a look at that be good with that
 
02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
and then uh
 
02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
I essentially reconsider our previous
 
02:02:14.990 --> 02:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
action of retaining this bill and then
 
02:02:16.970 --> 02:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
we can bring this amendment as ought to
 
02:02:19.070 --> 02:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
pass as amended next door across the
 
02:02:56.089 --> 02:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
on this one
 
02:02:57.840 --> 02:02:58.669 align:start position:0%
on this one
um

02:02:58.669 --> 02:02:58.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:01.010 --> 02:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
I think if I recall our discussions
 
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday correctly the committee was
 
02:03:05.330 --> 02:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
leaning more towards just clarifying the
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
language that instead of it you know
 
02:03:10.669 --> 02:03:10.679 align:start position:0%
that this is just removing the language
 
02:03:13.209 --> 02:03:13.219 align:start position:0%
that says in the bathrooms right right
 
02:03:15.890 --> 02:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
so that's the amendment look and change
 
02:03:18.830 --> 02:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
changed girls to
 
02:03:24.649 --> 02:03:24.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:33.890 --> 02:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
who have a motion to adopt a member uh
 
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
zero nine three three h Joe okay do a
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
second Mary all those in favor
 
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
post yeah
 
02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
okay do we need to reconsider the first
 
02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
or was that just still sort of an
 
02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:48.169 align:start position:0%
or was that just still sort of an
informal

02:03:48.169 --> 02:03:48.179 align:start position:0%
informal
 
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
I think we'll just make it clear that
 
02:03:51.770 --> 02:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
this bill is no longer retained the
 
02:03:53.450 --> 02:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
recommendation is ought to pass as
 
02:03:55.669 --> 02:03:55.679 align:start position:0%
amended yep and we'll we'll talk about
 
02:04:03.530 --> 02:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:06.169 --> 02:04:06.179 align:start position:0%
so also just to confirm the episode of
 
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
treatment bill that we're good with
 
02:04:09.530 --> 02:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
that's going to go in House Bill 2 along
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
with the appropriation of house bill one
 
02:04:12.589 --> 02:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
so we got that done
 
02:04:14.450 --> 02:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
I do have
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
if you recall so on page one of our
 
02:04:20.330 --> 02:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
packet for today page uh 44 section 121
 
02:04:22.370 --> 02:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
the dot relative to the rights away the
 
02:04:24.589 --> 02:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
prime Wetlands I did get a response from
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
the department and a proposed change
 
02:04:28.609 --> 02:04:28.619 align:start position:0%
that you know they that maybe you could
 
02:04:39.709 --> 02:04:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:06.410 --> 02:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
I have a hard time supporting this
 
02:05:10.370 --> 02:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate I'm a big fan of Dot and
 
02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:15.169 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate I'm a big fan of Dot and
um

02:05:15.169 --> 02:05:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
and I it's my you know I am a fan of
 
02:05:20.089 --> 02:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
Quinn you know we all get along really
 
02:05:22.729 --> 02:05:22.739 align:start position:0%
well I don't these that dot needs should
 
02:05:24.530 --> 02:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
get a buy from protecting the prime
 
02:05:27.169 --> 02:05:27.179 align:start position:0%
Wetlands a lot of What DOT does does
 
02:05:28.910 --> 02:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
damage to the wetlands and when they're
 
02:05:30.649 --> 02:05:30.659 align:start position:0%
doing their work I think they should be
 
02:05:32.810 --> 02:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
respectful of the value of the Prime
 
02:05:34.669 --> 02:05:34.679 align:start position:0%
wetlands and so I don't think they
 
02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
should be exempt from taking care of
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
them when they're doing their
 
02:05:39.229 --> 02:05:39.239 align:start position:0%
maintenance within the prime wetlands
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:45.589 --> 02:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:05:47.870 --> 02:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
I was of the opinion that all this did
 
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
was eliminated a couple of the steps
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
that they could get around
 
02:05:55.729 --> 02:05:55.739 align:start position:0%
the law if you want to call it that and
 
02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
do what they needed to do this would
 
02:05:59.450 --> 02:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
just eliminate a couple of steps and
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
make their drug easier that's the way I
 
02:06:03.890 --> 02:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
understood it I might be wrong
 
02:06:05.330 --> 02:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
very much I can just respond when he
 
02:06:08.810 --> 02:06:08.820 align:start position:0%
says you know the change will clarify
 
02:06:10.250 --> 02:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
the department does not need to adhere
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
to stricter Wetlands requirements so to
 
02:06:15.410 --> 02:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
me it gets around what they should do it
 
02:06:17.810 --> 02:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
gets around what they're required to do
 
02:06:19.490 --> 02:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
to do what they want to do they'll
 
02:06:21.530 --> 02:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
they're able to do what they need to do
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
while they are taking the prime Wetlands
 
02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
into consideration
 
02:06:28.010 --> 02:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
and so I don't think it's a num I don't
 
02:06:29.629 --> 02:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
think it's just like paper steps that
 
02:06:31.070 --> 02:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
they have to skip through I think that
 
02:06:32.270 --> 02:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
they're actually changing what they
 
02:06:34.370 --> 02:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
would do when they're doing the work and
 
02:06:36.109 --> 02:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
that's so I have a problem with that I
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
think you know what they're doing around
 
02:06:39.530 --> 02:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
the wetlands really does have an impact
 
02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
on the wetlands and I think it's our
 
02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility to protect those and if
 
02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit longer work for them
 
02:06:47.209 --> 02:06:47.219 align:start position:0%
you know I'm sorry but I
 
02:06:50.149 --> 02:06:50.159 align:start position:0%
you know it may cost a little more now
 
02:06:52.129 --> 02:06:52.139 align:start position:0%
it may cost a lot more when we damage
 
02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
our Wetlands later on
 
02:06:56.089 --> 02:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:06:58.310 --> 02:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
a planning board of conservation that's
 
02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:06.410 --> 02:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
yes I miss
 
02:07:09.530 --> 02:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
the impetus how this fell in our lap uh
 
02:07:11.089 --> 02:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
who is requesting this change as the
 
02:07:14.270 --> 02:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
actual dot is requesting this okay
 
02:07:16.729 --> 02:07:16.739 align:start position:0%
thank you if I may I mean my my
 
02:07:18.109 --> 02:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
understanding of this and I would
 
02:07:19.850 --> 02:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
appreciate if somebody would correct me
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
that my if my recollection is not
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
accurate is that this is intending to
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
clarify that people cannot come after
 
02:07:28.189 --> 02:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
the fact when all this have already been
 
02:07:31.070 --> 02:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
established and come now designated as a
 
02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
prime you know Wetland and change the
 
02:07:35.450 --> 02:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
rules and basically make it impossible
 
02:07:37.129 --> 02:07:37.139 align:start position:0%
for the Department to use existing
 
02:07:37.139 --> 02:07:40.149 align:start position:0%
for the Department to use existing
easements

02:07:40.149 --> 02:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:45.649 --> 02:07:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.629 --> 02:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
this but but it's for existing things
 
02:07:49.189 --> 02:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's things that are already in
 
02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
place maintaining existing things right
 
02:07:58.609 --> 02:07:58.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:58.619 --> 02:08:01.490 align:start position:0%
 
but

02:08:01.490 --> 02:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:01.500 --> 02:08:02.750 align:start position:0%
 
but

02:08:02.750 --> 02:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:08:05.629 --> 02:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
that isn't that those the fact that
 
02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
those things the easements have been in
 
02:08:10.010 --> 02:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
place before and the you know and then
 
02:08:12.290 --> 02:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
this is declared Prime Wetland and now
 
02:08:13.850 --> 02:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
people change the rules and the
 
02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
department cannot uh you know do their
 
02:08:17.570 --> 02:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
maintenance work anymore
 
02:08:19.790 --> 02:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
they have to ask they have to coordinate
 
02:08:21.890 --> 02:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
with the town they are coordinating with
 
02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
a town but it's just if this is done
 
02:08:26.570 --> 02:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
post-facto it it could essentially be a
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
way for the Department to lose access to
 
02:08:31.669 --> 02:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
you know culverts and easements that
 
02:08:33.530 --> 02:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
they need to use as a
 
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
as a real estate attorney in my former
 
02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:35.990 align:start position:0%
as a real estate attorney in my former
life

02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
life
 
02:08:37.550 --> 02:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
um who practice you know real estate
 
02:08:40.250 --> 02:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
property law I think there are important
 
02:08:42.890 --> 02:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
uh processes in place under current
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
statute that require the dot to go
 
02:08:47.629 --> 02:08:47.639 align:start position:0%
through a formal administrative request
 
02:08:50.629 --> 02:08:50.639 align:start position:0%
to go outside of the you know specified
 
02:08:53.149 --> 02:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
law if they want to do you know
 
02:08:53.159 --> 02:08:54.169 align:start position:0%
law if they want to do you know
additional

02:08:54.169 --> 02:08:54.179 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:08:56.330 --> 02:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
you know incursions into these Wetland
 
02:08:59.149 --> 02:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
areas to mean you know to maintain their
 
02:09:01.370 --> 02:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so I think you know those
 
02:09:03.169 --> 02:09:03.179 align:start position:0%
important steps have been put into law
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
in the past because there has been
 
02:09:08.450 --> 02:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
um a perceived need for that you know
 
02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:10.619 align:start position:0%
give and take of local conservation
 
02:09:12.050 --> 02:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
commissions weighing in and other
 
02:09:14.450 --> 02:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
stakeholders being able to to say hey
 
02:09:16.189 --> 02:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
this particular piece of wetland
 
02:09:19.129 --> 02:09:19.139 align:start position:0%
property has specific characters the dot
 
02:09:20.450 --> 02:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
needs to come to us and we need to have
 
02:09:22.850 --> 02:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
that conversation I think by changing
 
02:09:26.270 --> 02:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
the statute by allowing them to have
 
02:09:28.430 --> 02:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
that waiver without that conversation it
 
02:09:31.070 --> 02:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
could be detrimental and so I think I
 
02:09:33.890 --> 02:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
think um while it may make the Dot's
 
02:09:35.689 --> 02:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
administrative burden a little lighter I
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
think that there's important reasons for
 
02:09:40.189 --> 02:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
having that conversation take place
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and you know through those steps that
 
02:09:44.709 --> 02:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
they'll need to go through so you know
 
02:09:47.589 --> 02:09:47.599 align:start position:0%
understanding you know how projects take
 
02:09:51.169 --> 02:09:51.179 align:start position:0%
develop over time and can have specific
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
characters for each characteristics for
 
02:09:56.030 --> 02:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
each project you know given the Wetland
 
02:09:59.089 --> 02:09:59.099 align:start position:0%
area and surrounding easements
 
02:10:02.649 --> 02:10:02.659 align:start position:0%
or you know just the actual you know
 
02:10:06.589 --> 02:10:06.599 align:start position:0%
uh these um these land survey maps that
 
02:10:09.410 --> 02:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
you look at you know they can change in
 
02:10:11.750 --> 02:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
character over time given you know
 
02:10:14.089 --> 02:10:14.099 align:start position:0%
changes of our climate or changes of the
 
02:10:14.099 --> 02:10:15.109 align:start position:0%
changes of our climate or changes of the
water

02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
water
 
02:10:18.169 --> 02:10:18.179 align:start position:0%
um riparian kind of flows so you know I
 
02:10:20.629 --> 02:10:20.639 align:start position:0%
know there's a specific need to go
 
02:10:23.149 --> 02:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
through these steps each time so I think
 
02:10:25.850 --> 02:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
giving the blanket waiver is could
 
02:10:28.070 --> 02:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
potentially have a lot of detrimental
 
02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
effects that we're not really prepared
 
02:10:32.270 --> 02:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
um in our capacity
 
02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
just sitting from a fiscal committee
 
02:10:39.229 --> 02:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
perspective I think you know my inkling
 
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
is to to say that
 
02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
the processes in place have been put
 
02:10:45.649 --> 02:10:45.659 align:start position:0%
there for a purpose and I'd like to
 
02:10:47.870 --> 02:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
support that I'm not sure that the dot
 
02:10:51.589 --> 02:10:51.599 align:start position:0%
should have a blanket waiver without
 
02:10:51.599 --> 02:10:52.490 align:start position:0%
should have a blanket waiver without
um

02:10:52.490 --> 02:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:54.410 --> 02:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
you know really
 
02:10:56.510 --> 02:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
investigating each change that they need
 
02:10:58.189 --> 02:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
and so you know I personally couldn't
 
02:11:01.129 --> 02:11:01.139 align:start position:0%
support this I don't think that that's a
 
02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
wise decision for our state because I
 
02:11:07.070 --> 02:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
just know there are so many particular
 
02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
02:11:10.669 --> 02:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
perspectives that need to be taken into
 
02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
account when you go through these
 
02:11:13.609 --> 02:11:13.619 align:start position:0%
changes and you know as someone who's
 
02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
worked on both sides of litigation
 
02:11:18.410 --> 02:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
related to this I think it's important
 
02:11:18.420 --> 02:11:19.729 align:start position:0%
related to this I think it's important
um

02:11:19.729 --> 02:11:19.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
you know making a big change like this
 
02:11:24.649 --> 02:11:24.659 align:start position:0%
could have big implications and I I just
 
02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
caution everybody from making a huge
 
02:11:28.550 --> 02:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
sleeping change that's not going to be
 
02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:30.050 align:start position:0%
sleeping change that's not going to be
helpful

02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
02:11:32.209 --> 02:11:32.219 align:start position:0%
I would just like to note that I would
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
prefer if we don't decide this today
 
02:11:36.410 --> 02:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
feel the need to do more homework and go
 
02:11:38.450 --> 02:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
back to the hearing and review the tape
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
of what was said at the time to refresh
 
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
my memory my recollection right now is
 
02:11:44.930 --> 02:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
just not accurate enough to be able to
 
02:11:47.270 --> 02:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
decide on it right now I think this is
 
02:11:51.229 --> 02:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
this wasn't his uh only portion this is
 
02:11:53.089 --> 02:11:53.099 align:start position:0%
this was one
 
02:11:56.050 --> 02:11:56.060 align:start position:0%
a small piece of the whole section
 
02:11:58.430 --> 02:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
there were multiple sections relative to
 
02:12:00.530 --> 02:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
rights of way changes so two of the
 
02:12:02.570 --> 02:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
three we were good with as a committee
 
02:12:04.250 --> 02:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
and those were accepted this third one
 
02:12:06.830 --> 02:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
was put on hold
 
02:12:08.270 --> 02:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
and the sounds of things I think it
 
02:12:09.770 --> 02:12:09.780 align:start position:0%
could stay on hold
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
or do we have to delete it
 
02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh you if you still want to discuss this
 
02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
at a future time whether it stays in or
 
02:12:18.890 --> 02:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
not you can you can just keep this topic
 
02:12:21.890 --> 02:12:21.900 align:start position:0%
on hold deleting it from House Bill 2 is
 
02:12:24.290 --> 02:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
is always a an acceptable option for the
 
02:12:25.609 --> 02:12:25.619 align:start position:0%
committee to if that's the direction you
 
02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
want to go
 
02:12:29.330 --> 02:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
so what you have is language the
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
governor put in House Bill 2 and then
 
02:12:33.229 --> 02:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
before you propose change that language
 
02:12:34.669 --> 02:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
the department provided at the end of
 
02:12:37.729 --> 02:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
last week so it says nor to provide
 
02:12:39.770 --> 02:12:39.780 align:start position:0%
mitigation which is a problem I mean we
 
02:12:42.050 --> 02:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
do want mitigation and I think that the
 
02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
local communities should have input
 
02:12:46.070 --> 02:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
because they know better than dot or
 
02:12:48.290 --> 02:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh the state of their
 
02:12:50.930 --> 02:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
wetlands and I think in particular we're
 
02:12:52.850 --> 02:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
going through a process right now you
 
02:12:55.129 --> 02:12:55.139 align:start position:0%
know the environmental process not man
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
not we're not doing anything in
 
02:12:58.970 --> 02:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
Newcastle but we have a wetland that is
 
02:13:00.350 --> 02:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
likely changing from a freshwater
 
02:13:02.810 --> 02:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
Wetland to a saltwater Wetland and it
 
02:13:04.850 --> 02:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
requires different information different
 
02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
stuff and I really think it's important
 
02:13:08.689 --> 02:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
to have the local communities involved
 
02:13:10.430 --> 02:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
when you're working in those areas
 
02:13:12.530 --> 02:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
you've got you've got culverts that
 
02:13:13.790 --> 02:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
especially with Newcastle we've got
 
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
culverts that are really small and
 
02:13:19.189 --> 02:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
falling in which need major repair and I
 
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
think we have that all across the state
 
02:13:21.890 --> 02:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
and I think it's really important that
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
we adhere to protecting those Wet Ones
 
02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:27.169 align:start position:0%
we adhere to protecting those Wet Ones
okay

02:13:27.169 --> 02:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:13:31.250 --> 02:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
yep all right comment right uh
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
I think we're it sounded like uh the
 
02:13:38.450 --> 02:13:38.460 align:start position:0%
d.o.t's Rogue and its uh actions and uh
 
02:13:40.310 --> 02:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily true because they
 
02:13:42.290 --> 02:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
have to go by a scope of work
 
02:13:45.530 --> 02:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
and they have experts that handle these
 
02:13:47.330 --> 02:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
things and they do an excellent job
 
02:13:49.550 --> 02:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
that's why we have good roads and we do
 
02:13:51.890 --> 02:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
have and they they know the differences
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
and they I think they're conservation
 
02:13:57.589 --> 02:13:57.599 align:start position:0%
commissions are great they're not
 
02:14:01.490 --> 02:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh staffed by expert people
 
02:14:04.850 --> 02:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
and uh you know I think uh this is a
 
02:14:06.649 --> 02:14:06.659 align:start position:0%
another step because every time you
 
02:14:08.930 --> 02:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
increase a step you can increase the
 
02:14:12.649 --> 02:14:12.659 align:start position:0%
cost and I and actually I observed uh
 
02:14:14.930 --> 02:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
firsthand uh when they were building a
 
02:14:18.830 --> 02:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
spalding Pike uh I happen to uh stop by
 
02:14:20.750 --> 02:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
my son's office who work for the state
 
02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
as an engineer and I they they look at
 
02:14:27.109 --> 02:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
turbidity of the water I mean it's and
 
02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
the uh they have to and they have to go
 
02:14:32.330 --> 02:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
by federal law too because you got uh
 
02:14:36.129 --> 02:14:36.139 align:start position:0%
you know Safe Water uh considerations
 
02:14:40.129 --> 02:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
but I mean it it they're they're so
 
02:14:41.930 --> 02:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
offensive every I mean there's all kinds
 
02:14:44.270 --> 02:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
of things it's not just you know they
 
02:14:46.129 --> 02:14:46.139 align:start position:0%
they don't just go in there and uh you
 
02:14:47.810 --> 02:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
know dig something up and let it go but
 
02:14:49.970 --> 02:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
they have to go by certain rules
 
02:14:52.910 --> 02:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
even even sell so you know we don't want
 
02:14:58.790 --> 02:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
as a bridge we're not going to cross
 
02:15:02.270 --> 02:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
today all right sounds good
 
02:15:05.209 --> 02:15:05.219 align:start position:0%
uh I'll point to a couple of things on
 
02:15:06.589 --> 02:15:06.599 align:start position:0%
this document we could probably deal
 
02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
line 42
 
02:15:14.689 --> 02:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
you'll see something new here uh it came
 
02:15:17.149 --> 02:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
to our attention in accounting unit 5032
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
that there was a for lack of a better
 
02:15:21.050 --> 02:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
term I think it was keying error and
 
02:15:22.430 --> 02:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
some Highway funds ended up in this
 
02:15:23.810 --> 02:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
accounting unit but there shouldn't be
 
02:15:25.729 --> 02:15:25.739 align:start position:0%
Highway funds in there so you actually
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
can make this adjustment here and
 
02:15:30.229 --> 02:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
improve the highway funds position by
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
sixty six thousand dollars not not huge
 
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
but it cleans it up and you gain a
 
02:15:35.089 --> 02:15:35.099 align:start position:0%
couple bucks
 
02:15:38.209 --> 02:15:38.219 align:start position:0%
okay all those in favor
 
02:15:40.609 --> 02:15:40.619 align:start position:0%
okay done
 
02:15:42.050 --> 02:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
I'm going to bounce all over the place
 
02:15:44.629 --> 02:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
here so if you look up on page on the
 
02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
same page line 19. if you recall we we
 
02:15:49.550 --> 02:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
approved this it's other funds this is
 
02:15:51.589 --> 02:15:51.599 align:start position:0%
the fire fund that's administered by the
 
02:15:53.689 --> 02:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
department of safety they'd asked for
 
02:15:55.310 --> 02:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
these positions during that discussion
 
02:15:57.530 --> 02:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
it was asked if part-time money could be
 
02:16:00.290 --> 02:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
reduced to offset the full-time the
 
02:16:02.510 --> 02:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
department did provide a memo here uh
 
02:16:05.330 --> 02:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
I'll just summarize they did they do say
 
02:16:07.370 --> 02:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
that their preference is to do the
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
action that you already took and the
 
02:16:10.129 --> 02:16:10.139 align:start position:0%
fire fund could absorb that action
 
02:16:11.629 --> 02:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
without an issue but I will give this
 
02:16:13.669 --> 02:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
just so their follow-up is on record
 
02:16:15.109 --> 02:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
with you
 
02:16:25.430 --> 02:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:29.030 align:start position:0%
 
19.

02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:31.690 align:start position:0%
 
99

02:16:31.690 --> 02:16:31.700 align:start position:0%
99
 
02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:41.810 --> 02:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:44.209 --> 02:16:44.219 align:start position:0%
if you could clarify for my recollection
 
02:16:46.370 --> 02:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
what is that we already did because I
 
02:16:51.589 --> 02:16:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:55.009 --> 02:16:55.019 align:start position:0%
on page three you'll see on on line 19
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
we added funding for three fire service
 
02:17:00.589 --> 02:17:00.599 align:start position:0%
instructor positions out of the fire
 
02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
fund and then during that conversation
 
02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
when these items were discussed it was
 
02:17:06.770 --> 02:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
asked if part-time money could be
 
02:17:08.929 --> 02:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
reduced since they were considering
 
02:17:12.589 --> 02:17:12.599 align:start position:0%
adding full-time uh this the action that
 
02:17:14.150 --> 02:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
the committee took is the preference of
 
02:17:15.469 --> 02:17:15.479 align:start position:0%
the department but they did follow up
 
02:17:16.969 --> 02:17:16.979 align:start position:0%
with information they weren't aware that
 
02:17:19.250 --> 02:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
you had taken that action Friday I think
 
02:17:21.709 --> 02:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
so I had when I had updated Steve today
 
02:17:23.509 --> 02:17:23.519 align:start position:0%
he had provided this memo so we thought
 
02:17:24.830 --> 02:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
we would complete the request for the
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
follow-up information but you don't have
 
02:17:28.429 --> 02:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
to do anything the invent of this memory
 
02:17:30.110 --> 02:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
if I read it correctly because I'm just
 
02:17:33.129 --> 02:17:33.139 align:start position:0%
seeing it is to say that
 
02:17:36.169 --> 02:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
they are capable of funding two of those
 
02:17:38.570 --> 02:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
positions from their existing funds by
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
transferring from the part-time and they
 
02:17:43.849 --> 02:17:43.859 align:start position:0%
are just requesting one position
 
02:17:43.859 --> 02:17:45.310 align:start position:0%
are just requesting one position
foreign

02:17:45.310 --> 02:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:17:48.110 --> 02:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
and I would move that we make those
 
02:17:50.690 --> 02:17:50.700 align:start position:0%
changes because right I'm sorry never
 
02:17:52.429 --> 02:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
mind me that's why I was asking what did
 
02:17:55.250 --> 02:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
we already do so this stuff for
 
02:17:56.990 --> 02:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
information only just so you'd have this
 
02:17:59.929 --> 02:17:59.939 align:start position:0%
complete uh response from them I oh so
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
this was the confirmation that what we
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
did on Friday is totally fine with them
 
02:18:06.049 --> 02:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that the fire fund
 
02:18:07.790 --> 02:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
does have any Appropriations that aren't
 
02:18:09.709 --> 02:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
expended it's a non-lapsing fund it
 
02:18:11.450 --> 02:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
stays in there they administer it they
 
02:18:13.129 --> 02:18:13.139 align:start position:0%
keep track of the balance that's uh
 
02:18:14.570 --> 02:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
their responsibility thank you for
 
02:18:21.530 --> 02:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:23.570 --> 02:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
don't have anything else that is in my
 
02:18:25.370 --> 02:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
opinion a softball I guess just to clean
 
02:18:27.290 --> 02:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
up either in house bill one or two or
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
any of our retained bills I don't know
 
02:18:30.889 --> 02:18:30.899 align:start position:0%
if there's anything more the committee
 
02:18:32.030 --> 02:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
wants to do today I know we have a
 
02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
public Hearing in about an hour and 45
 
02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:35.650 align:start position:0%
public Hearing in about an hour and 45
minutes

02:18:35.650 --> 02:18:35.660 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
02:18:38.270 --> 02:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
in reptile
 
02:18:41.209 --> 02:18:41.219 align:start position:0%
so that's where we're at
 
02:18:43.969 --> 02:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
I think we ought to make book on what
 
02:18:46.730 --> 02:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
what the topics are going to be
 
02:18:50.709 --> 02:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:54.169 --> 02:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
I guess one thing is uh so we're not
 
02:18:55.669 --> 02:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
going to meet again until Friday
 
02:18:58.129 --> 02:18:58.139 align:start position:0%
uh is there anything specific that you
 
02:19:00.110 --> 02:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
want to to work on Friday while we're in
 
02:19:02.330 --> 02:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
committee I can have prepared
 
02:19:15.349 --> 02:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:22.849 --> 02:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:24.830 --> 02:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
02:19:26.389 --> 02:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
it depends it's hard to predict the pace
 
02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
that will go on Friday and how prepared
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
we are to make decisions a lot of the
 
02:19:32.750 --> 02:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
decisions remaining are so looking on
 
02:19:34.669 --> 02:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
page three here there's a lot of general
 
02:19:36.349 --> 02:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
and Highway funded requests from the
 
02:19:38.389 --> 02:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety you do have some
 
02:19:39.889 --> 02:19:39.899 align:start position:0%
fish and game requests here that are
 
02:19:42.709 --> 02:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
mainly General funds they're not huge
 
02:19:44.950 --> 02:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
dollars I think one of the
 
02:19:47.209 --> 02:19:47.219 align:start position:0%
directives or directions that I think
 
02:19:49.429 --> 02:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
the full committee is hoping is any
 
02:19:51.349 --> 02:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
additions you make you're also making
 
02:19:52.969 --> 02:19:52.979 align:start position:0%
corresponding reductions somewhere and
 
02:19:54.530 --> 02:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
doing Net Zero which we haven't really
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
been doing to this point uh outside of
 
02:19:59.150 --> 02:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
the 75 million dollar in the education
 
02:20:00.410 --> 02:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of money in the education
 
02:20:02.389 --> 02:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
trust fund right now
 
02:20:04.670 --> 02:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
so unless we start doing funding swaps
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
you know moving some of the Gen the
 
02:20:08.030 --> 02:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
education trust fund out into the
 
02:20:09.650 --> 02:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
general fund and using the general fund
 
02:20:12.710 --> 02:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
for some of these it you know so there's
 
02:20:15.230 --> 02:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of a lot of potential
 
02:20:16.910 --> 02:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
moving Parts here there's a lot of ways
 
02:20:19.250 --> 02:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
to to go about this what do you think if
 
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
we devoted four or five hours to it on
 
02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
Friday he would be able to resolve it I
 
02:20:25.310 --> 02:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
think if we if if anyone had any
 
02:20:27.469 --> 02:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
initiatives that you want to propose for
 
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
Friday to discuss versus you know so if
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
we came in with an amendment or a game
 
02:20:33.410 --> 02:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
in with a proposal perhaps we could do
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
that Friday I worry that if we came in
 
02:20:37.550 --> 02:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
and started a conversation from scratch
 
02:20:39.530 --> 02:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
on Friday we probably wouldn't get too
 
02:20:41.330 --> 02:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
far but if we had documents to work off
 
02:20:43.010 --> 02:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
of some proposals or amendments I think
 
02:20:44.809 --> 02:20:44.819 align:start position:0%
we could be productive Friday
 
02:20:46.849 --> 02:20:46.859 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we have any we don't
 
02:20:48.469 --> 02:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
right now no then that's what I'm saying
 
02:20:51.290 --> 02:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
so uh so you know flipping over to Page
 
02:20:51.300 --> 02:20:52.490 align:start position:0%
so uh so you know flipping over to Page
Six

02:20:52.490 --> 02:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
Six
 
02:20:54.410 --> 02:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
we can see we've got an education trust
 
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
fund with 100 million dollars sitting in
 
02:20:58.730 --> 02:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
there you know so some of those those
 
02:21:01.010 --> 02:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
proposals or some of those programs
 
02:21:02.030 --> 02:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
funded in there we've talked about
 
02:21:05.450 --> 02:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
increasing ins in increasing School
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
building aid for instance or changing Ed
 
02:21:08.570 --> 02:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
funding those would obviously impact
 
02:21:09.770 --> 02:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
your bottom line we've talked about
 
02:21:12.349 --> 02:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
moving some revenues out of the
 
02:21:14.510 --> 02:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
education trust funds so those types of
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
proposals if anyone has anything like
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure
 
02:21:21.170 --> 02:21:21.180 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where we're at I guess with
 
02:21:24.410 --> 02:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
that conversation what if we posted it
 
02:21:26.809 --> 02:21:26.819 align:start position:0%
for Saturday and if we don't need it
 
02:21:28.910 --> 02:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
just don't go I mean that that would
 
02:21:28.920 --> 02:21:29.929 align:start position:0%
just don't go I mean that that would
work

02:21:29.929 --> 02:21:29.939 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:21:32.090 --> 02:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
I think we'd know Friday if there was
 
02:21:33.530 --> 02:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
benefit to coming in the next day or not
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
or waiting until Monday so but when when
 
02:21:37.849 --> 02:21:37.859 align:start position:0%
is the deadline for posting in the
 
02:21:40.429 --> 02:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
calendar it's 24 hours to post any
 
02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
meeting but we can uh you know we'll
 
02:21:44.690 --> 02:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
I'll have Janet post it today so at
 
02:21:46.010 --> 02:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
least it's on the digital calendar okay
 
02:21:48.349 --> 02:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
I'd also recommend Mr chair at this
 
02:21:50.570 --> 02:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
point with our budget work sessions that
 
02:21:54.650 --> 02:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
you recess versus adjourn or end so that
 
02:21:56.690 --> 02:21:56.700 align:start position:0%
way uh for instance we don't have
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
anything scheduled
 
02:22:02.210 --> 02:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday but if we fly over across
 
02:22:03.889 --> 02:22:03.899 align:start position:0%
the hall and get done very early and you
 
02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
did want to call division two together
 
02:22:08.510 --> 02:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
we could if you recessed today as an
 
02:22:10.849 --> 02:22:10.859 align:start position:0%
example at the end of today which are
 
02:22:12.650 --> 02:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
rapidly approaching yes we'll recess
 
02:22:15.250 --> 02:22:15.260 align:start position:0%
until Wednesday or just recess and just
 
02:22:18.650 --> 02:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
indefinitely we're recessed yeah yes I
 
02:22:20.570 --> 02:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
recall it used to be that at some point
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh maybe earlier than now we got an
 
02:22:24.710 --> 02:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
estimate of what they were giving to
 
02:22:26.690 --> 02:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
each division got an estimate of what
 
02:22:29.150 --> 02:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
they have we haven't gotten that yet
 
02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:40.570 align:start position:0%
they have we haven't gotten that yet
well

02:22:40.570 --> 02:22:40.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:43.070 --> 02:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
but that was just the revenue we are
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
also adding you know we are also
 
02:22:47.450 --> 02:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
increasing the budget and we'll have to
 
02:22:49.309 --> 02:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
find those budget those funds too not
 
02:22:51.469 --> 02:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
just the 90 million but everything we
 
02:22:53.210 --> 02:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
had something's got to come from
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere well a lot of them have gone
 
02:22:56.990 --> 02:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
in the education trust me yeah but
 
02:22:59.630 --> 02:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
usually we are given a proportion we're
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
given an estimate of how much goes to
 
02:23:03.410 --> 02:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
div one div two and div three and I'm
 
02:23:04.670 --> 02:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
not aware that we've gotten that
 
02:23:07.969 --> 02:23:07.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
so I think we're working through what we
 
02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
can to this point and I would think by
 
02:23:13.130 --> 02:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
hopefully by the end of this week we'll
 
02:23:13.140 --> 02:23:14.929 align:start position:0%
hopefully by the end of this week we'll
have

02:23:14.929 --> 02:23:14.939 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:23:17.150 --> 02:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
a clear bigger picture you know so some
 
02:23:19.070 --> 02:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
of these decisions of can we afford two
 
02:23:20.330 --> 02:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars for this maybe
 
02:23:22.910 --> 02:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
one better idea by the end of the week
 
02:23:22.920 --> 02:23:25.849 align:start position:0%
one better idea by the end of the week
um

02:23:25.849 --> 02:23:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:27.290 --> 02:23:27.300 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say hopefully but
 
02:23:28.730 --> 02:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
hopefully because that would mean we're
 
02:23:31.429 --> 02:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
we're making progress right so I hope
 
02:23:33.050 --> 02:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll be in a good position to
 
02:23:35.389 --> 02:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
have a long day Friday we have any bills
 
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh Wednesday
 
02:23:40.990 --> 02:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
across the hall in full committee yeah
 
02:24:09.969 --> 02:24:09.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:21.730 --> 02:24:21.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:25.010 --> 02:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to is I'd like to have
 
02:24:28.370 --> 02:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
somebody speaking to our bills
 
02:24:28.380 --> 02:24:31.370 align:start position:0%
somebody speaking to our bills
so

02:24:31.370 --> 02:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:31.380 --> 02:24:32.870 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:37.929 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

02:24:37.929 --> 02:24:37.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:41.809 --> 02:24:41.819 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm happily willing to let somebody
 
02:24:49.670 --> 02:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:53.650 --> 02:24:53.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:58.030 --> 02:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:01.010 --> 02:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
I think they were all unanimous this is
 
02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
just the first committee uh the first
 
02:25:04.670 --> 02:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
referred bills that we got so these are
 
02:25:07.070 --> 02:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
the early ones I think for us everything
 
02:25:11.030 --> 02:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
was either retained unanimous was 129
 
02:25:14.210 --> 02:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
the hygiene products Bill and 207 which
 
02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
was that just local school budget impact
 
02:25:18.410 --> 02:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
there was no FN on that bill so I think
 
02:25:20.510 --> 02:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
our bills are pretty
 
02:25:24.650 --> 02:25:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
we only have two
 
02:25:28.490 --> 02:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
we only have two bills that I think are
 
02:25:30.530 --> 02:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
not uh retained but we still have to
 
02:25:32.750 --> 02:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation of retain over
 
02:25:33.889 --> 02:25:33.899 align:start position:0%
there and the full committee would vote
 
02:25:35.690 --> 02:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
to retain okay
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
but I think I've I'd have to look at the
 
02:25:39.290 --> 02:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
list again but I think it's only 129 and
 
02:25:42.349 --> 02:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
207 that are moving along yeah since
 
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:53.270 --> 02:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
if if it was it was just an ought to
 
02:25:55.010 --> 02:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
pass I think this is our only amendment
 
02:25:57.530 --> 02:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
it's just the one we did today
 
02:26:00.290 --> 02:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
because on my mind is scrambled on
 
02:26:01.910 --> 02:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
the whole committee meeting we haven't
 
02:26:03.950 --> 02:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
had one more voting stuff out in a long
 
02:26:06.290 --> 02:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
time so I'm just
 
02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
and at some point I get the pleasure of
 
02:26:12.650 --> 02:26:12.660 align:start position:0%
going over this entire hb2 and so we'll
 
02:26:16.929 --> 02:26:16.939 align:start position:0%
yeah so on it all goes well Monday the
 
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
27th I think it is or whenever the
 
02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
Monday is around there is when each
 
02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
division will be presenting the
 
02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
culmination of all the recommendations
 
02:26:25.370 --> 02:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
to the full committee so all the changes
 
02:26:28.010 --> 02:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
so we'll have uh one of those detail
 
02:26:31.250 --> 02:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
change documents the legal size uh with
 
02:26:32.210 --> 02:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
all the
 
02:26:34.309 --> 02:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
each accounting unit essentially change
 
02:26:37.010 --> 02:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
that you do in the operating budget and
 
02:26:39.070 --> 02:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
then we'll have a house bill one and two
 
02:26:41.950 --> 02:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
packet so it'll it'll be similar to this
 
02:26:44.929 --> 02:26:44.939 align:start position:0%
with all of our amendments attached to
 
02:26:46.490 --> 02:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
it that we're admending House Bill too
 
02:26:48.590 --> 02:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
and that's when you would walk through
 
02:26:51.230 --> 02:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
the detail change and the index and the
 
02:26:52.910 --> 02:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
all the Amendments so if there's an item
 
02:26:54.290 --> 02:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
on here
 
02:26:58.070 --> 02:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
that is not affecting any we didn't
 
02:26:59.809 --> 02:26:59.819 align:start position:0%
change anything it wouldn't even be
 
02:27:01.490 --> 02:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
included in that document so it would be
 
02:27:03.710 --> 02:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
included in your final full committee
 
02:27:05.870 --> 02:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill too but you're only going to
 
02:27:07.010 --> 02:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
speak to the changes that we're
 
02:27:09.290 --> 02:27:09.300 align:start position:0%
recommending to one and two that I can
 
02:27:09.300 --> 02:27:10.790 align:start position:0%
recommending to one and two that I can
handle

02:27:10.790 --> 02:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
handle
 
02:27:13.610 --> 02:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:17.270 --> 02:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
so 207 what was 207
 
02:27:19.429 --> 02:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
I think 207 was relative to increasing
 
02:27:20.809 --> 02:27:20.819 align:start position:0%
the threshold of when a local school
 
02:27:22.849 --> 02:27:22.859 align:start position:0%
district has to have a public hearing on
 
02:27:27.349 --> 02:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
a dollar amount yeah so I think it right
 
02:27:29.690 --> 02:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
yep yeah and I I'd have to look at the
 
02:27:31.610 --> 02:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
list but I feel like everything else was
 
02:27:33.290 --> 02:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
retained and then there's the hygiene
 
02:27:35.150 --> 02:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
bill right if I'd have to double check
 
02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:36.349 align:start position:0%
bill right if I'd have to double check
but

02:27:36.349 --> 02:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:27:38.570 --> 02:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
but if there was anything else it was
 
02:27:40.130 --> 02:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
not a significant believer everything
 
02:27:43.130 --> 02:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
was unanimous trying to steal myself so
 
02:27:45.530 --> 02:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
I don't like wake up two o'clock
 
02:27:47.210 --> 02:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
Tuesday morning
 
02:27:50.570 --> 02:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
panicked so now I'm I'm less panicked
 
02:27:53.050 --> 02:27:53.060 align:start position:0%
that's more of a 5 a.m thing
 
02:27:56.389 --> 02:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
well that's that's all right
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
but I think we uh
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
it's a that starts at 10 o'clock on
 
02:28:02.510 --> 02:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
Wednesday as I recall yeah I think
 
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's a non-germaine public hearing at
 
02:28:07.550 --> 02:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
10 and then a work session on 14 husband
 
02:28:10.309 --> 02:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
49 again a full committee and then the
 
02:28:11.750 --> 02:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
full committee exact on all the bills I
 
02:28:14.690 --> 02:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
think starts at 11. okay
 
02:28:16.969 --> 02:28:16.979 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be a long day
 
02:28:19.370 --> 02:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
so everybody should take their Awards
 
02:28:21.230 --> 02:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
name tags
 
02:28:23.570 --> 02:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
right yeah the next meeting for us will
 
02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
be in the full the full room
 
02:28:27.290 --> 02:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
so we
 
02:28:29.690 --> 02:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
so we take our own name tags right yeah
 
02:28:32.570 --> 02:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
are you down with public hearing yeah I
 
02:28:34.070 --> 02:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
think they'll have tables set up or
 
02:28:35.990 --> 02:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
usually they set up like uh folding
 
02:28:39.130 --> 02:28:39.140 align:start position:0%
tables in like the front of reps
 
02:28:42.190 --> 02:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
I gotcha yeah
 
02:28:44.330 --> 02:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
I forgot about you'll be in reps Hall
 
02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
this afternoon hey it's still close you
 
02:28:47.389 --> 02:28:47.399 align:start position:0%

02:28:49.010 --> 02:28:49.020 align:start position:0%

02:28:49.969 --> 02:28:49.979 align:start position:0%
missed it
 
02:28:57.410 --> 02:28:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:57.420 --> 02:28:59.090 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:28:59.090 --> 02:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:29:06.530 --> 02:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:11.710 --> 02:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:15.950 --> 02:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
matter of fact he was there complaining
 
02:29:18.110 --> 02:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
oh don't you point fingers
 
02:29:22.750 --> 02:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:27.950 --> 02:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:27.960 --> 02:29:31.849 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:29:31.849 --> 02:29:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:35.090 --> 02:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
well that's true so we'll recess this
 
02:29:35.100 --> 02:29:39.469 align:start position:0%
well that's true so we'll recess this
session

02:29:39.469 --> 02:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
