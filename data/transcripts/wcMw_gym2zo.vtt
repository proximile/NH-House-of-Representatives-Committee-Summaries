Okay.

191
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.500
We all set now?

192
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.000
I know they were in checking the sound earlier.

193
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:42.500
Is it sounding there were complaints that I couldn't be heard, which I always find hard to believe anybody's complaining about, but apparently that happened this morning.

194
00:06:42.500 --> 00:07:01.000
We're all right okay great good afternoon everybody today we are reconvening the November 16th special committee on redistricting of the House of Representatives in New Hampshire meeting scheduled to address the bills in our executive session.

195
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:16.000
The meeting was begun at 10 o'clock and recessed until 1, and I want to thank everybody on the committee as to their indulgence with that change in start time.

196
00:07:16.000 --> 00:08:13.500
It became necessary so we could be sure that everybody would actually have copies of any amendments that members wished the committee to address in connection with the bills we are looking at today an agenda has been posted as to what we will be looking at and for your information all of the amendments that we are considering today have been posted online so in continuing to try to make this process as transparent as possible, I suspect there might be an amendment or two that not all members have even looked at at this point in time, but we have an able group here and will be able to get through our business.

197
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:23.000
Before we begin that business, I would ask that you rise and join me in a Pledge of Allegiance.

198
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:38.500
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

199
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.500
I'm watching.

200
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.000
Oh, that was pretty good.

201
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:57.500
All right, so today we are doing our voting in what we call an executive session here in the House on the redistricting bills that are before the committee.

202
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:36.500
The bills that we are considering and the order in which we are considering them on in is HB 51 in regards to the state senate hb 53 in regards to the executive council hb 55 in regards to delegates to the state convention hb 54 in regards to the county commissioner hb 52 in regards to congressional districts and hb 50 in regard to state representatives as i I stated earlier, we are starting a little late.

203
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:50.000
We are going to assess where we are, committee, at about 4 o'clock as to how far we've gotten and what we want to use for time.

204
00:09:50.000 --> 00:10:01.000
We have scheduled a session for tomorrow to make sure we have sufficient time to address everything that we need to address.

205
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.500
The amendments for people who are listening Thank you.

206
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:57.500
to address everything that we need to address we the amendments for people who are listening amendments are proposed by committee members and they are sent to our office of legislative services for drafting and I will take ownership of one of the initial delays in the preparation of the paperwork your chair found an email to OL an email address to OLS that no one knew existed, and proposed amendments were sent there, and your chair didn't understand why she wasn't getting anything back, and we had a little ruckus here for a while, and that's what happened to some of our amendments.

207
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:25.500
So it's been, we've learned all sorts of new things as we chart course here but we have everything that i think the committee needs to proceed having said that the first bill that we will address is hb 51 which is apportioning state senate districts is there a a motion in regards to HB 51?

208
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.500
Representative McGuire.

209
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

210
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.500
I move interim study.

211
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.500
Is there a second?

212
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.500
Second, Madam Chair.

213
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.500
Representative McGuire moves.

214
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.500
Representative Turcotte seconds.

215
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.500
Interim study on the state Senate.

216
00:11:42.500 --> 00:12:38.500
And that Senate note that Senator Gray from the Senate chair of their redistricting commission is here with us today representative McGuire would you like to speak to your motion yes thank you madam chair the house doesn't read set the state Senate districts traditionally that's their job so we don't need to send it off to the senate because they already have a senate bill which they will use for that purpose and this bill would simply be killed in this or tabled in the senate we don't want to kill it here because if we do, that'll create an administrative issue that we can easily prevent by not killing it.

217
00:12:38.500 --> 00:13:07.500
And if you have it, you know, just in case there's a major attack of madness in the Senate and they don't pass a redistricting bill or it doesn't meet the minimum requirements, we could use this in an emergency to do so because if we interim study it will be kept in the possession of this committee.

218
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.500
Is there any further discussion on HB 51?

219
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:19.000
I'm not seeing any so I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll.

220
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Representative Stephen Smith.

221
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Yes.

222
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Representative Carol McGuire.

223
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Yes.

224
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Representative Turcotte.

225
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Yes.

226
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Representative McDonald votes yes.

227
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Representative Lynn.

228
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Yes.

229
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Representative Berry.

230
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Yes.

231
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Representative Alexander.

232
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Yes.

233
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Representative Berry.

234
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Yes.

235
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Representative Alexander.

236
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000

Representative Wilhelm.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Yes.

249
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Representative Piedra.

250
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Yes.

251
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Representative Weber.

252
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Yes.

253
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Representative Wilhelm.

254
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Yes.

255
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Representative Simpson.

256
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Yes.

257
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.500
The vote is unanimous, 15 to 0.

258
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.500
Not until I vote.

259
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.000
Oh, I'm sorry, Representative Griffin.

260
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Sorry.

261
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Yes.

262
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Sorry.

263
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Okay.

264
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:58.000
The next bill before this committee for consideration is HB 53 in regards to apportioning executive council districts.

265
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Is there a motion?

266
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Representative Lynn.

267
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Yes, Madam Chair.

268
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.500
I move that HB 53 also be referred to interim study.

269
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.500
Is there a second?

270
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.500
Yes, Madam Chairman, I second Representative Lynn's motion.

271
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.500
Representative Berry, thank you.

272
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.500
Is there discussion to the motion, Representative Lynn?

273
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.000
Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.

274
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Basically for the same reasons referred to by Representative McGuire with respect to the Senate reapportionment, that's the reason for requesting interim study on this bill.

275
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:53.500
Pursuant to the understanding that was agreed to between the House and the Senate, it's my understanding that the Senate is to take the lead on the reapportionment of the executive council districts.

276
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:59.000
And so this is a vehicle that allows that to happen.

277
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Once the Senate has completed its work, it will then come over to the House and we will then act on it.

278
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Thank you.

279
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.500
Is there any further discussion on this?

280
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:21.500
Seeing none, I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll.

281
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.500
Representative Stephen Smith.

282
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.500
Yes.

283
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.500
Representative McGuire.

284
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.500
Yes.

285
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.500
Representative Turcotte.

286
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.500
Yes.

287
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.500
Representative McDonald votes yes.

288
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.500
Representative Lynn.

289
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.500
Yes.

290
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.500
Representative Berry.

291
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.500
Yes.

292
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.500
Representative Alexander.

293
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.500
Yes.

294
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.500
Representative Marjorie Smith.

295
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.500
Yes.

296
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.500
Representative Bergeron.

297
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.500
Yes.

298
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.500
Representative Lane.

299
00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.500
Yes.

300
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.500
Representative Piedra.

301
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.500
Yes.

302
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.500
Representative Weber.

303
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.500
Yes.

304
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.500
Representative Wilhelm.

305
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.500
Yes.

306
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.500
Representative Simpson.

307
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.500
Yes.

308
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.500
Representative Griffin.

309
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.500
Yes.

310
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.500
Unanimous, Madam Chairman.

311
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.500
Thank you.

312
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:44.500
The next bill to be considered this morning is HB 55 that bill is in regards to the apportionment of delegates to the state party convention there for committee members we have tried to put the amendments in the order of consideration.

313
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:50.500
Is there a motion in regards to an amendment to HB 55?

314
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.000
The chair recognizes Representative McDonald.

315
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Yes, Madam Chairman.

316
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.500
I would like to move the amendment to pass.

317
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.500
And that would be Amendment 2021-2247?

318
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.500
That's correct, Madam Chairman.

319
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.500
Thank you.

320
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.500
Is there a second?

321
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.500
Yes.

322
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.000
Representative Stephen Smith seconds it.

323
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Representative McDonald, would you like to speak to your motion?

324
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.500
Yes, I would, Madam Chairman.

325
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.500
Thank you.

326
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:36.500
The position of delegate to the State Convention affords people who lack the time or money to run for public office to be involved in the political process.

327
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:44.500
Electing delegates on a public primary ballot makes the process an open one and maximizes participation.

328
00:18:44.500 --> 00:19:02.500
However, when delegates are elected on a public ballot, they should also be apportioned by the standard of one person, one vote, just as any other elected position in the state primaries held to that standard.

329
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:12.500
Accordingly, this amendment provides that state convention delegates will be elected by state representative districts, which conform to that principle.

330
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.500
Is there any further discussion on the amendment?

331
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:37.500
The amendment, committee members will note also because of what it's proposing to do substantially shortens the bill in that it will just reference the apportionment in the state rep statute instead of containing it within the bounds of 662 colon 6.

332
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:49.000
i'm not sure saving that amount of paper is going to make up for what we did in this committee, but it's something.

333
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Any further discussion on the amendment?

334
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Representative Marjorie Smith.

335
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Yes, Chair, thank you.

336
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
No?

337
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Read down.

338
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.500
Push the red one down.

339
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.500
I tried.

340
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.500
Am I now?

341
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.500
I'm sorry.

342
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:17.000
Madam Chair, I listen with interest to what you have, has been said about House Bill 55.

343
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:28.000
I personally do not understand why something having to do with a political party, one political party comes before the redistricting committee.

344
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.500
I would think this should be handled within the political party.

345
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:39.000
But I understand that as things are now, it is here.

346
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:48.500
I will certainly vote to support what those of you who are affected by this want to have happen.

347
00:20:48.500 --> 00:21:02.000
But I would hope that as soon as it's possible, the procedure for delegates to state convention be handled within the party and not within the legislature.

348
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Thank you.

349
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.500
Thank you for those comments.

350
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.500
Representative Steve Smith.

351
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

352
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:15.500
I agree that it's weird that it's in the statute.

353
00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.500
Nonetheless, it is.

354
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:23.000
The apportionment for state delegates is currently contained in RSA 662.

355
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:35.000
and the scope of this committee's work is to determine apportionment not the underlying policy and for that reason I support Representative McDonald's amendment.

356
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Representative McGuire.

357
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Thank you Madam Chair.

358
00:21:39.000 --> 00:22:07.500
This amendment also has the advantage that it will not require redefinition after further census so this should never come before this committee again it can go to a policy committee if necessary but we have defined the delegate districts such that they will always be be proportional by making them equal to state state representative districts.

359
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.500
Thank you.

360
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:15.000
Any further discussion we have on the floor amendment 2021 2247.

361
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.500
I'm seeing none I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll.

362
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.500
Thank you, Madam Chairman.

363
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.500
Representative Stephen Smith.

364
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.500
Yes.

365
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.500
Representative McGuire.

366
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.500
Yes.

367
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.500
Representative Turcotte.

368
00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.500
Yes.

369
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.500
Representative McDonald votes yes.

370
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.500

Thank you.

396
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
The amendment to HB 55 has been passed.

397
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Is there a motion?

398
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Yes, Madam Chairman.

399
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
I would like to move that the HB 55 be the motion.

400
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.500
My motion would be ought to pass as amended.

401
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.500
Is there a second?

402
00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.500

403
00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.500
Representative Stephen Smith seconds the motion.

404
00:23:55.500 --> 00:24:05.000
Is there any further discussion on the amendment on the floor, which is OTP A HB 55, Amendment 2247?

405
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000

Representative McDonald votes yes.

413
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Representative Lynn.

414
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Yes.

415
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Representative Berry.

416
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Yes.

417
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Representative Alexander.

418
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000

422
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Yes.

423
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Representative Berry.

424
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Yes.

425
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Representative Alexander.

426
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Yes.

427
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Representative Marjorie Smith.

428
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Yes.

429
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Representative Bergeron.

430
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Yes.

431
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Representative Lane.

432
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Yes.

433
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Representative Piedra.

434
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Yes.

435
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Representative Weber.

436
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Yes.

437
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Representative Wilhelm.

438
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Yes.

439
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Representative Simpson.

440
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Yes.

441
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Representative Griffin.

442
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Yes.

443
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.500
15 to 0, Madam Chairman.

444
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.500
Thank you.

445
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.500
This is a piece of cake everybody huh?

446
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.500
No issues.

447
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.500
Okay.

448
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:42.000
The next bill before this committee is HB 54.

449
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
This is apportioning county commissioner districts.

450
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000
There is an amendment that committee members have, which is amendment 2021-2273.

451
00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:44.500
I would point out that members have been provided with a set of maps that has handwriting Porter on it which should have been whited out in the copying but we do the best we can when we can get it and these printouts of the maps the maps only correspond to the language in HB 54 and that's been just provided for committee members assistance we all have maps as proposed from our session approximately two weeks ago so HB 54 is now before the committee do I have a motion in regards to any amendments into it for HB 54 is now before the committee.

452
00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:51.000
Do I have a motion in regards to any amendments for HB 54?

453
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Representative McGuire.

454
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

455
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
I move Amendment 2273 to House Bill 54.

456
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Is there a second?

457
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
I second.

458
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Representative McGuire, would you like to speak to your motion?

459
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Yes, thank you.

460
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:36.500
This amendment has the commissioner districts for every county except for Stratford, where they don't have districts, and is based on the districts that were presented at the public hearing, and some with changes due to comments at the public hearing or other maps that were presented to us, namely largely minority maps.

461
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:48.000
They are, of course, with all districts contiguous, all the populations are equal within a reasonable deviation, and they meet all constitutional requirements.

462
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Thank you.

463
00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:13.000
For purposes of the members here, some of whom I'm sure are trying to collate this information Representative McGuire could you indulge the chair and Tell us whether the proposed Belknap map relates to the majority or the minority map presented earlier in this committee's work.

464
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:37.500
I Believe that's the minority map thank you and the proposed district for Carroll is that the majority or the minority I believe that is also the minority map as is as is the map for Sullivan I think okay and Chesh, is that the majority or the minority?

465
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.500
I believe that's the minority map.

466
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:44.000
Actually, I believe is Cheshire the minority?

467
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.500
Yeah, I don't think so.

468
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.500
Thank you.

469
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.500
Representative Weber.

470
00:28:50.500 --> 00:29:04.000
I'm a little bewildered because my understanding was that the Belknap map, which I'm not as familiar with, was, I thought that there were two different ones.

471
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:11.500
I didn't realize, is the minority map as presented completely unchanged from the current map?

472
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.500
Yes.

473
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.500
Okay.

474
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.500
Thank you, that's helpful.

475
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:35.000
And my understanding is that the map that was, unless you have changed your minds, Cheshire was very much reorganized from the majority and I saw a map in here somewhere that had the reorganization.

476
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.500
So Cheshire is not a minority map.

477
00:29:38.500 --> 00:30:06.000
if the representative McGuire will indulge me let me go through so that you have the packages in front of you and I'm just going to compare them to what we had when we were before the committee to be sure that the amendment proposes what was the minority proposed map for Belknap County Commissioners.

478
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
The amendment for Carroll County Commissioners proposes the majority lines.

479
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:27.000
The amendment for the Cheshire commissioner proposes the majority proposed lines the co-host which is on the backside black and white that was a whole other issue with emailing things last week.

480
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.500
The COAS map, as proposed, is the minority map.

481
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:40.500
The Grafton map, as proposed by the majority amendment, is, let me just make sure, the minority map.

482
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:46.000
And I'll simply point out so people understand the only difference.

483
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:55.000
And I'll simply point out so people understand the only difference between our maps as proposed was Ellsworth.

484
00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.500
So the majority agreed with the minority's proposal and moved Ellsworth.

485
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:05.500
Hillsborough is the proposed minority map from our earlier work.

486
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:51.500
Merrimack is the proposed majority map from our earlier work Rockingham is the proposed majority map with a slight modification since then Stratford as we have already discussed is not mapped it's dealt with within the first sentence or two of the statute because they elect their commissioners at large and the Sullivan commissioner map proposed I'm making sure in your handout matches to what I have is the minority proposed Commissioner map question of the chair hold on for one minute I'm looking around I've got you representative Weber Representative Webber.

487
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

488
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:59.000
I just have a question of how we are to proceed.

489
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:23.500
The changes in Belknap and Sullivan relieve my mind considerably, but is it my understanding, I think this is what I understood from an email you sent around earlier, we will vote on the majority amendment first, and then you will allow us to offer further amendment after that.

490
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:30.000
That is correct, and it's how I understand amendments have basically been prepared.

491
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
It is.

492
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:40.500
I just wanted to be sure I was with the program because we've juggled a lot lately.

493
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:59.500
Yeah, we've all juggling and if we had I did consider just so committee members know at one point doing this county by county but that would have resulted in at least nine more roll calls than needed.

494
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:06.500
And so it's fine I just wanted to be sure I was understanding her.

495
00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:12.000
I think so that is the proposed amendment to HB 54.

496
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Representative Marjorie Smith.

497
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Thank you very much, Madam Chair.

498
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.500
I just want to confirm that I'm on the right page.

499
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:44.500
According to my summary of what you have just presented, of the nine counties under consideration with the elimination of my county, Stratford County, five of the counties, Belmont, Belknap, Coas, Grafton, Hillsborough, and Sullivan, the Republican and the Democratic proposals are the same.

500
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:57.000
So long as the Democrat proposal and the amendments before me are the same as what was presented at committee and brought to public hearing.

501
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
That is correct.

502
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Thank you.

503
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.500
And so that leaves Cheshire, Merrimack, Rockingham as the— And Carroll.

504
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.000
I'm sorry, and Carroll County.

505
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
I missed that one.

506
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:25.500
as the four counties that we have basically some, to varying degrees, some as the four counties that we have basically some, to varying degrees, some difference of opinion.

507
00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.500
Correct.

508
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:32.000
And that's where we would be focusing our discussion.

509
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Is that correct?

510
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:41.000
That is what I understand the status of things to be at this time.

511
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.500
Thank you very much for that clarification.

512
00:34:44.500 --> 00:35:03.000
So again the amendment before the committee is 2021 2273 as representative Smith has just indicated it it presents a combination of commissioner maps that the committee has already reviewed with a small change to Rockingham County.

513
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:22.000
And some of this has to do with the fact that I think in one case we had a map that we were missing a ward and then we realized it was the same as the minority map.

514
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:58.500
So in an effort to try and sort of move as many things along in a bipartisan manner as possible the amendment proposes using the maps proposed by essentially all committee members there might be some difference just if you look at it in regards to the order of districts depending on how yours was put together the order of districts gets assigned by the program in the order you make the map.

515
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:53.500
And we have tried to go through and correspond the districts within the commissioner to the extent it's the current map with the current district so that those map number those commissioner districts for the counties will remain the same representative Weber I guess that okay I'm just looking at I see that I see that in the in the amendment is presented and I thank you for that clarification I'm just going to say that although I very much appreciate the efforts to reach agreement that this amendment represents because of its portrayal of Cheshire County and several of the other counties, I'm reluctantly unable to vote for it.

516
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:58.000
So I just wanted to state that up front.

517
00:36:58.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Could you just clarify because of its what of the other counties I'm I'm reluctantly unable to vote for it so I just wanted to state that up front could you just clarify because of its what of the counties because the way we have achieved a consensus on a number of the counties but we have not achieved consensus on all of the counties and in particular my own county so all right I just thought I wanted I just heard the word betrayal so i just wanted no i think it was portrayal was the word i used see that's why i asked but i'd already forgotten that anyway i i appreciate the effort but i'm still not going to be able to vote for it and thank you for the opportunity to that.

518
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:14.000
You could vote for it because it's going to eliminate the need to address five amendments.

519
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:21.000
That would be dereliction of my duty, and I try not to do that.

520
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
All right.

521
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Just a suggestion.

522
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
All right.

523
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Any further discussion on what is on the floor now?

524
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
I understand the amendment is on the floor.

525
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
It is Amendment 2021-22-73.

526
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Representative Lane.

527
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Thank you.

528
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:50.000
I just have a procedural question, and I think I got it, but I'm not sure.

529
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:58.500
So in light of what Representative Weber just said, again, my county's Merrimack, you're adopting the majority.

530
00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:10.000
If I vote for this, I'm actually saying I vote for the Merrimack plan that the majority has put forward, which I don't.

531
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.500
So it means I have to vote against the entire bill.

532
00:39:15.500 --> 00:40:00.500
Well, or you could argue that you are in favor of the amendment because it gets it closer to where you want to be, and it will then be opened up to further amendment, and then there will be a final motion, will be OTP as amended which I suspect is where your real difficulty lies is passing the bill as amended containing majority maps so I think you could argue that you're in favor of the amendment because it gets it you closer to where you want to be.

533
00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:14.500
I think we've had members on some of our committees who vote for amendments and then when it comes to the bill as amended the vote is different.

534
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:16.500
You are correct.

535
00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:22.000
I was jumping ahead to the next vote so I apologize.

536
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
All right.

537
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Anybody else.

538
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.500
The motion on the floor is Amendment 2021-2073 to HB 54.

539
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:37.500
Seeing none, I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll.

540
00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.500
Representative Stephen Smith.

541
00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.500
Yes.

542
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.500
Representative McGuire.

543
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.500

Representative Alexander.

552
00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.500
Yes.

553
00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.500
Representative Marjorie Smith.

554
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.500
Yes.

555
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.500
Representative Bergeron.

556
00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.500
Yes.

557
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.500
Representative Lane.

558
00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:15.500
Yes.

559
00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.500
Representative Piedra.

560
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.500
Yes.

561
00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.500
Representative Weber.

562
00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.500
Yes.

563
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.500
Representative Webber.

564
00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.500
No.

565
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.500
Representative Wilhelm.

566
00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.500
No.

567
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.500
Representative Simpson.

568
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.500
Yes.

569
00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.500
Representative Griffin.

570
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:39.500
Yes.

571
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.500
The vote is 13 to 2.

572
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:50.500
HB 54 has been amended and remains in front of the committee open to further amendment.

573
00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:57.500
Is there anybody else who would like to offer an amendment to HB 54?

574
00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.500
4.

575
00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:06.500
Carol would come before Cheshire, so why don't we do them in that order?

576
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:10.500
That would be probably helpful for keeping track.

577
00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.500
Right.

578
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.500
Okay.

579
00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.500
Representative Lane.

580
00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.500
Yes.

581
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.500
Thank you.

582
00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:24.500
I would put forth an amendment to ...

583
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:48.500
Sorry, I've got a stack here 0 2 1 for purposes of people with the packet it is the last one representative Lane has moved 2021 2270 is there a second second representative Weber has seconded that motion representative Lane would you like to speak to your motion?

584
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.500
Yes, Madam Chair.

585
00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:57.500
The offered amendment is the minority map that was discussed earlier in the week.

586
00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:10.000
It basically offers no change to the existing commission or districts on the thought that the deviation and the population had not changed that much.

587
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:16.500
So it was not necessary to, uh, make any changes in that county.

588
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.500
Thank you.

589
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:24.000
Is there further discussion on the amendment that's on the floor?

590
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
The amendment is 2270.

591
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:33.500
I'm not seeing any so I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll.

592
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.500
Representative Stephen Smith.

593
00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.500
No.

594
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.500
Representative McGuire.

595
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.500
No.

596
00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.500
Representative Turcotte.

Representative McDonald votes no.

599
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.500
Representative Lynn.

600
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.500
No.

601
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.500
Representative Berry?

602
00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.500
No.

603
00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.500
Representative Alexander?

604
00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.500
No.

605
00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.500
Representative Marjorie Smith?

606
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.500
Yes.

607
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.500
Representative Bergeron?

608
00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.500
Yes.

609
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.500
Representative Lane?

610
00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.500
Yes.

611
00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.500
Representative Piedra?

612
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.500
Yes.

613
00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.500
Representative Webber?

614
00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:47.500
Yes representative Simpson yeah representative Griffin no what vote is eight to seven madam chairman amendment 2270 fails on a on a vote of seven to eight seven eight I'm sorry is there a further amendment to HB 54 is amended representative Weber thank you madam chair I'd like to offer amendment 2021 1-2269H as it relates to Cheshire County.

615
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:52.000
Second from the back in the packet as stapled.

616
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Is there a second to Representative Weber's motion?

617
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.500
Representative Piedra seconds the motion.

618
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:03.500
Would you like to speak to your motion, Representative Weber?

619
00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.500
Thank you.

620
00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.500
Yes, I would.

621
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:13.500
What is represented in 2020-2269 is no change from the current district.

622
00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:25.000
And in support of this motion, I would note that the, first of all, that the deviation on this map is 3.7 overall.

623
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:44.000
It's minus 1.6 to positive 2.1, whereas the map contained in the amendment that was just voted has a deviation of minus 3.5 to 4.0 for a total of 7.5 or twice the deviation of the existing map.

624
00:45:44.000 --> 00:46:07.000
I also point out that the existing map represents, with the exception of the city of Keene and whatever is attached to it, which is essentially the same, the current map divides the county basically north-south, whereas the amendment we just voted on divides it east-west.

625
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:30.500
The north-south orientation has, over the last 10 years, resulted in competitive districts that have been held by both Republicans and Democrats within the course of the last 10 years, and therefore, I think, is the most competitive alignment and also represents a closer to the ideal.

626
00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:37.000
So for that motion, for that, those reasons I would support this amendment.

627
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.500
Is there anybody else who'd like to speak to the amendment?

628
00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:51.000
I'm not seeing any further discussion, so I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll.

629
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Representative Stephen Smith.

630
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
No.

631
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Representative McGuire.

632
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
No.

633
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Representative Turcotte.

634
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000

Representative Berry.

No.

Representative Alexander.

641
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000

The vote is 7 to 8.

659
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Amendment 2269 fails.

660
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000
The HB 54 remains on the floor amended by 2273.

661
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Is there a further amendment to HB 54 remains on the floor amended by 2273 is there a further amendment to HB 54 representative Lane yes madam chair I would like to propose amendment 202 1-2 to 6 1h relating to Merrimack County Commissioners.

663
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000

Representative Lane, would you like to speak to your motion?

666
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
It's about three in on the stapled package.

667
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.500
For Merrimack County we're talking about, right?

668
00:48:41.500 --> 00:49:09.500
Yes yes the proposed minority map is what is being proposed in this amendment it's it moves one town Wilmot from district 2 to district 3 so it has much less change in its in the in the districts and what is that what is included in the districts and what is included in the districts.

669
00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:13.500
And as with Cheshire, the orientation is changing.

670
00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:47.500
It's going more on a north-south orientation rather than the existing east-west orientation and I would propose that this are the minority map is disrupt less disruptive and only moves one town and we should adopt that thank you representative Lane would anybody else like to speak to the motion I'm seeing no further indication of discussion so I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll.

671
00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:52.500

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000
Thank you.

709
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Is there any further discussion on the amendment on the floor, which is 2266?

710
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.500
I'm seeing no further discussion.

711
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:11.500
I want to thank my clerk for today.

712
00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:15.000
It's going to be a long one.

713
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.000
I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll.

714
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Representative Stephen Smith.

715
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
No.

716
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Representative McGuire.

717

No.

718
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Representative Turcotte.

719
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000
No.

720

Representative McDonald votes no.

721
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Representative Lynn.

722
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
No.

723
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Representative Berry.

724
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000
No.

725

Representative Alexander.

726
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000

Representative Marjorie Smith.

728
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Yes.

729
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Representative Bergeron.

730
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000

731

Representative Lane.

732

Yes.

733
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Representative P.

734

Yes.

736
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Representative Weber.

737
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Yes.

738
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000
Representative Wilhelm.

739
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Yes.

740
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000
Representative Simpson.

741
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Yes.

742
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Representative Griffin.

743
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
No.

744
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
7-8.

745
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.500
Amendment 2266 to HB 54.

746
00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.500
Yes.

747
00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:28.500
Representative Griffin.

748
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.500
No.

749
00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:55.000
amendment 2266 to HB 54 fails is there a further amendment to HB 54 as amended by 2273 is that it I haven't been keep a track if you all can just want to check to make sure that is Is that it for your proposed amendments to it?

750
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.500
I haven't been keeping track.

751
00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:08.000
If you all can just want to check to make sure that is that it for your proposed amendments to it?

752
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Okay.

753
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:17.500
Yes, I had two others, but they were taken care of in the majority amendment.

754
00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.500
Thank you, ma'am.

755
00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:26.000
I was not keeping track of how many we were doing versus counties.

756
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000
So, all right.

757
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Are there any further amendments to HB 54?

758
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.500
HB 54 is before the committee now as amended by 2021-2273H.

759
00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:47.500
Is there any further discussion on the motion that is before the committee in regards to the amended HB 54?

760
00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.500
Representative Smith.

761
00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:52.500
Thank you very much, Madam Chair.

762
00:54:52.500 --> 00:55:08.500
I can do a few things well, and one of the things I can do is count, as long as there are not too many individual counts that have to be taken.

763
00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:12.500
I only have ten fingers and 10 toes.

764
00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:22.000
So I know what the outcome is going to be, regardless of what my Democratic colleagues and I do.

765
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:38.000
When I look at this at House Bill 54 as amended, I see that of the nine counties at issue, in five of the nine, the majority has supported the minority amendments.

766
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:43.500
And that leaves four where there has not been an agreement.

767
00:55:43.500 --> 00:56:07.500
I am not happy that our four amendments, which I think are superior to those that now stand in House Bill 54 as amended, I'm unhappy that our amendments have not been accepted, but I recognize that contrary to popular opinion, we don't live in a perfect world.

768
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:32.500
And with five of the nine counties having versions in this amendment that are both the Democratic and now the Republican version, I am going to support this bill, acknowledging to myself and to the public that it is not a perfect bill, but then rarely are these bills perfect.

769
00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.500
Thank you, representative Smith.

770
00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:44.000
Is there any further discussion on the amendment on the floor, which is HB 54 as amended, 2021, 2273.

771
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000
And actually I apologize.

772
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.000
There is not a motion on the floor.

773
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Representative Weber.

774
00:56:52.000 --> 00:57:00.500
Um, do you want to wait for a motion first or do you want to do that?

775
00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:05.000
Is there a motion in regards to HB 54?

776
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Representative McGuire.

777
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:38.500
Thank you, Madam madam chair I move ought to pass with amendment thank you is there a second yes madam chair I second that representative Weber thank you madam chair I I still am very concerned about the districts in in the four districts where we were not able to reach consensus And therefore I am reluctantly going to vote against this plan.

778
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.500
Thank you, Representative Weber.

779
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:43.500
Any further discussion on the amendment?

780
00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:45.500
Representative Lane.

781
00:57:45.500 --> 00:58:10.000
I think it would help me to get to where Representative Marjorie Smith is if i better understood the reasoning behind the decisions for carroll merrimack cheshire for the maps that are being proposed what were the issues that made the majority favor those rather than the minority maps.

782
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.000
It would help me make a better decision.

783
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000
If I .

784
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:23.500
What were the issues that made the majority favor those rather than the minority maps?

785
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:29.500
It would help me make a better decision if I understood those.

786
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:34.500
Representative Lane has addressed a question to fellow committee members.

787
00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:42.000
Does anyone feel a response or will the record as to the meeting last week?

788
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Representative McGuire.

789
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
Yes.

790
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

791
00:58:48.000 --> 00:59:04.000
I can only speak definitively to the Merrimack County map, but the Republican or the map that we have approved attaches only one town to the city of Concord rather than two.

792
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:27.000
So makes it more compact and simpler and the populations of the two districts are the same within seven people so it is as even as we could make it to split the county into three parts further discussion represent is that a hand representative Weber.

793
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:33.500
I'm going to raise a further question when it comes to Cheshire County.

794
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:50.000
You started by saying that the numbers of the districts were given in the first instance because of the way the maps were drawn and the order in which the maps were drawn.

795
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.500
And there has been a renumbering since.

796
00:59:53.500 --> 01:00:10.000
But the further concern I have with respect to the county of Cheshire is that, as do I think some other counties, we elect one commissioner for a four-year term Here we go.

797
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:24.000
is that as do I think some other counties, we elect one commissioner for a four-year term every three years and that four-year term rotates through the districts.

798
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:36.000
And last term, the four-year term was elected out of what was then District 1, and the commissioner resides in the town of Walpole.

799
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.500
He was duly elected for a four-year term from District 1.

800
01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:46.000
The town of Walpole is now in District Three.

801
01:00:46.000 --> 01:01:46.000
And I am wondering if it is the intent of the author of the accepted amendment that the duly elected commissioner who has not moved and who continues to live in the county, but who is no longer in the same numbered district because of your renumbering, does he lose his duly elected four-year seat or does he keep his duly elected four-year seat I believe those questions should be directed to the Secretary of State's office I believe the intent with the numbering was to try to keep Keene in the same district I know that there were other counties who were dressed a rotating election issue I I know in my county of Hillsborough County, we do not.

802
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I only know that because we received public comment, I believe on Rockingham at one of our hearings.

803
01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:03.500
Um, but those in regard that those questions in regards to elections can be addressed representative McGuire.

804
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.500
Thank you, Madam chair.

805
01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:23.500
If you look on page 2, part 2, which is line 26, it says no provision of this act shall be construed as affecting the constituencies or terms of office of county commissioners presently in office.

806
01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:27.000
Thank you very much for the clarification.

807
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
I appreciate it.

808
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:37.500
And I think you will find that language consistent with other districting statutes that we are addressing.

809
01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.500
I appreciate it.

810
01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.500
Thank you.

811
01:02:41.500 --> 01:03:13.000
consistent with other districting statutes that we are addressing I appreciate thank you I do understand there were some complaints about name badges that had district numbers on them that might have to change but that's really was not a concern of the committee is there any further discussion on the motion on the floor, which is HB 54 as amended by 2021-2273?

812
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Seeing none, I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll.

813
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Representative Stephen Smith.

814
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Yes.

815
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Representative McGuire.

816
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Yes.

817
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Representative Turcotte.

818
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Yes.

819
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Representative McDonald votes.

820
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Yes.

821
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Representative Lynn.

822
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Yes.

823
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Representative Barry.

824
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Yes.

825
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Representative Alexander.

826
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Yes.

827
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Representative Marjorie Smith.

828
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Yes.

829
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Representative Bergeron.

830
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
No.

831
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Representative Lane.

832
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Yes.

833
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Representative Piedra.

834
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
No.

835
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Representative Webber.

836
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
No.

837
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Representative Wilhelm.

838
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
No.

839
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Representative Simpson.

840
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
No.

841
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Representative Griffin.

842
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Yes.

843
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Yes.

844
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Ten to five.

845
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.500
HB 54 has been amended by 2021-2273.

846
01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:31.500
I have no further amendments or action on HB 54.

847
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:35.500
So we will move on to HB 52.

848
01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:39.500
HB 52 is the apportionment of congressional districts.

849
01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:44.000
You should have before you amendment 2021 22 71.

850
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.500
Along with another amendment in your pile.

851
01:04:47.500 --> 01:05:13.000
In regards to HB 52 is there a motion on any amendments to HB 52 representative Barry yes madam chairman I would move to adopt amendment 2021-2271 H for HB 52 is there a second second representative Lynn seconds the motion would you like to speak to your motion, Representative Berry?

852
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.500
Yes, thank you, Madam Chairman.

853
01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:26.000
This amendment is for the, it's proposed the changing of the congressional district lines here in the state of New Hampshire.

854
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:35.000
The proposed amendment meets all constitutional requirements of both the United States and the state of New Hampshire.

855
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:51.500
The district is completely contiguous and has a population deviation of 88 in one and 89 in the other because an odd, the total statewide population is an odd number divided by two.

856
01:05:51.500 --> 01:06:00.000
And we spoke at length about this when it was introduced in I guess our last meeting.

857
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:06.500
And I represent the Manchester Swords 8, 9, and the town of Litchfield.

858
01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.500
Manchester is in CD1.

859
01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.500
Litchfield is in CD2.

860
01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:24.500
Directly to the east of Litchfield is Londonderry, which is in CD1, and directly to the west of Litchfield is the town of Merrimack, which is in CD1.

861
01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:34.500
I was elected to fight for my people, so I did, and I brought Litchfield into CD1 where it belongs.

862
01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:44.000
Then we looked down and we said, why can't we bring the other communities adjacent to Litchfield into CD1?

863
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.500
You cannot bring Nashua in.

864
01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:51.500
The population of Nashua would throw the map all off.

865
01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:56.000
So we brought in Wyndham, Hudson, Salem, Pelham, Atkinson.

866
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.500
You have to backfill that.

867
01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:08.500
The current congressional districts are off by 9,000 people to begin with, so CD1 already had to give to CD2.

868
01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:14.000
You backfill that population with Rochester, Dover, Summersworth, Durham, and Portsmouth.

869
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.500
That is the rationale, one of the rationales behind this map.

870
01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:25.000
There is a notion out there that these maps are uncompetitive.

871
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
It's just not true.

872
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.000
When they made this allegation, I went and I looked.

873
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:39.000
What would be the election results in 2020 if these maps were in place?

874
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:46.000
The generic Republican congressional candidate would have won by barely a percent, one percent%.

875
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000
We know what the results of the current maps are.

876
01:07:51.000 --> 01:08:49.000
And there was a statement made in the last hearing about how these districts are competitive and Madam Chairman asked another member of the committee what were the results of the current maps over the last 10 years and no one knew the answer to it or at least no one was willing to say it but I will say it one party there have been five elections underneath the current maps two congressional seats that's ten contests ten contests one party has won 90% of the contests so asked, when we started receiving emails about supporting or opposing maps, I know members of the committee asked some people what they liked about the majority maps.

877
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000
We also received emails against the maps talking about competitiveness and fairness.

878
01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:04.500
So I did the same thing that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle did.

879
01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:09.500
I asked, what is your standard for competitiveness and fairness?

880
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:23.000
No one was able to give me an answer because once you actually look under the hood of the current congressional maps, you realize they're not competitive.

881
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
They're just not.

882
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
They're objectively not.

883
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:44.500
90% one partyparty domination in a state, which Senator Hasson said on Sunday on WMUR is a purple state, having 90% of your congressional delegation be from one party over a decade is not competitive.

884
01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.500
It's not representative.

885
01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:50.500
So the argument rings very hollow with me.

886
01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.500
Thank you, Representative Berry.

887
01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:58.500
Is there anybody else who would like to speak to the motion?

888
01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.500
Representative Lynn.

889
01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

890
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:11.500
We have heard a great deal about gerrymandering during the course of the various hearings we have held.

891
01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:18.000
I'd like to refer to Merriam-Webster's dictionary on what the definition of gerrymandering.

892
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:31.000
It is, and I'm quoting, to divide or arrange a territorial unit into election districts in a way to give one political party an unfair advantage.

893
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000
So let's see if what the majority proposes does that.

894
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:42.000
We've heard a number of things during the course of the hearings.

895
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:50.500
One of the frequent refrains is that voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around.

896
01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:55.500
That's a great talking point, but it has no substance.

897
01:10:55.500 --> 01:11:08.500
Whether directly or indirectly through some kind of commission established by the legislatures, it is always the legislators who decide what districts voters are assigned to.

898
01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:11.000
Voters never make that choice.

899
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:18.500
Many whom we have heard from ask us to take account of communities of interest.

900
01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:26.000
but the only community of interest they don't want us to consider is political like-mindedness.

901
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:37.500
Yet particularly considering that we are dividing up districts for voting purposes, political affinity would seem to be among the most important considerations.

902
01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:45.500
Notably, in 2010, our Democratic colleagues recognized that political similarities did constitute a community of interest.

903
01:11:45.500 --> 01:12:05.500
They then told the Supreme Court to define, and I'm quoting here, community of interest as, quote, a group of people concentrated in a geographic area who share similar interests and priorities, whether social, cultural, ethnic, economic, religious, or political.

904
01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:12.500
The reality is that Republicans and Democrats are not dispersed evenly throughout the state.

905
01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:28.000
For example, not only politically, but socially and culturally, the Portsmouth-Durham area has much more in common with Plymouth, Keene, Hanover, and Concord than it does with Manchester, Salem, or Derry.

906
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:35.500
Our proposal aligns political communities of interest much better than our Democratic Friends proposal does.

907
01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:51.500
And by the way, I must add that it is interesting that in the Democratic proposal, the one town that is changed under their proposal happens to be a solidly Republican town.

908
01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.000
Is that just a coincidence?

909
01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:05.000
One of the things that my colleague, Representative Berry, has already referred to the question of whether districts are competitive or not.

910
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:11.000
As he points out, neither district is really competitive, but particularly CD2.

911
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:23.500
And the notion, as Mapathon suggests, that a 10.4 percent Democratic advantage makes the district somehow competitive is just, I submit, cannot be taken seriously.

912
01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:36.500
According to the Mapathon analysis, the districts range from, excuse me, I'm sorry, under our proposal, I should say, The District 1 becomes significantly more competitive.

913
01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:43.500
It goes from a 5.2% plus for the Democrats to 1.8% plus for Republicans.

914
01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:52.000
The other point I would make here is how important is it for districts to be competitive?

915
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Well, the arguments that are made are, one, it forces candidates to the center.

916
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:16.500
Well, I guess the question I would ask is, is this really true, given that we have a primary process, which on both sides of the aisle, frankly, does not drive candidates to the center?

917
01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:29.500
For example, claims that Bernie Sanders couldn't win a national election did not prevent New Hampshire Democrats from giving him a victory in our presidential primary.

918
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:35.000
More importantly, forcing to the center discourages reform and new ideas.

919
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:57.000
In a sense, it is analogous to cancel culture in that it says that debate is permitted only within a narrow range of acceptability as determined by some nebulous standard established by the media or other elite forces, forces not accountable to the citizenry.

920
01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:07.500
For example, would Ronald Reagan or Bernie Sanders ever have emerged as real political forces under the centrist candidates only formulation?

921
01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:13.500
Remember the attacks on Reagan by both Democrats and more centrist Republicans?

922
01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:22.500
His views on foreign policy will quote start World War III and his domestic policies are voodoo economics.

923
01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:33.000
Yet those policies brought about the collapse of the Soviet Union and are one of our longest periods of sustained prosperity.

924
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Moreover, as Mr.

925
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:51.000
McGuire explained at one of our hearings, having safe seats leads to seniority, which gives a congressman or congressperson greater political power, which works to the advantage of his or her state.

926
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
So what is the bottom line?

927
01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:07.500
Our colleagues across the aisle basically assert that on a statewide basis, our congressional delegation should produce an allocation that matches the political breakdown of the state.

928
01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:16.500
They argue, in effect, that New Hampshire voters generally lean about 53% voting Democrat and 45% voting Republican.

929
01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:43.000
I'm not sure that I agree with that assessment, nor do I agree with their idea that a voter whose vote is equally weighted with that of every other voter under the one-man-one-vote principle is somehow, quote, disenfranchised because of the way other voters in his or her district may cast their ballots.

930
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:49.000
But for present purposes, let's assume that the Democrats' view is correct.

931
01:16:49.000 --> 01:17:08.000
What the Democrats and the Mapathon folks propose to do is construct a congressional district so that both districts will be Democrat-leaning anywhere from roughly 4.5 to 10 percent% and what will be the result of their formulations.

932
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:14.500
With 53% of the voters, Democrats will get 100% of the congressional seats.

933
01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:29.500
They will win both CD1 and CD2, meaning that under their thesis, the 45% of the electorate that tends to vote Republican will be, quote, disenfranchised, to use their term.

934
01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:47.500
Under the Republican proposal, by contrast, which aligns the districts more closely to the voters' leanings, the 53 percent Democrat versus 45 percent Republican breakdown will will more likely, although not inevitably, yield a 50-50 split.

935
01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:52.000
One Democrat in CD2 and one Republican in CD1.

936
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.500
Thus, under our formulation, 3% of Democratic voters will be disenfranchised.

937
01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:07.500
So which is fair, disenfranchising the 45% of voters who lean Republican or the 3% of voters who lean Democratic?

938
01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:10.500
The answer, I submit, is obvious.

939
01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:36.000
In other words, if what our critics say is true, that what we are doing is creating one Republican and one Democratic seat, then by their very logic, more people will be represented by the candidate of their choice under our proposal than under the current maps or the Democratic proposal.

940
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:54.500
If our critics really want a map that provides for actual representation, where the most people are voting for the candidate of their choice, who has a fair chance of winning, then our map accomplishes that goal.

941
01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.500
One final point.

942
01:18:56.500 --> 01:19:20.000
To the extent our Democratic friends suggest that our proposal to the vote in each congressional district, that under our proposal the vote in each congressional district will be a foregone conclusion and that candidates of the disfavored party will have no incentive to run for office.

943
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.500
I submit this is a significant exaggeration.

944
01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:34.500
It is based on the notion that voters are automatons who have no control over their own vote or their own destinies.

945
01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:39.500
But of course nothing could be further from the truth.

946
01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:45.500
Perhaps the best example of this is the existing executive council districts.

947
01:19:45.500 --> 01:20:02.000
The theory was that Council District 2 would pack together all of the Democrats so that while it would always yield a Democratic counselor, the other four council districts would always vote Republican.

948
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Yet as we saw in the 2018 election, that theory didn't hold.

949
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:14.500
The Executive Council in that cycle consisted of three Democrats and two Republicans.

950
01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:27.500
Another more recent example is the 2020 election, in which the same statewide electorate that elected Democratic Senator Gene Shaheen also elected Republican Governor Chris Sununu.

951
01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:47.000
In short, while based on past history, electoral districts may be inclined to lean toward one party or the other, in reality the outcome of any particular election is controlled by the individual voters just as it should be.

952
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

953
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Thank you, Representative Lynn.

954
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:56.500
Is there any further discussion on the amendment on the floor?

955
01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.500
Representative Marjorie Smith.

956
01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.500
Thank you very much, Madam Chair.

957
01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:22.000
I apologize to the committee that I did not prepare a long written statement, and therefore there is no possibility of my being as eloquent as my colleague was just before I began speaking about the reasons for this particular amendment.

958
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:41.000
I was surprised, perhaps a little surprised, to hear my colleague speak in great detail about exactly what it was that Democrats were thinking in how they proposed their amendment and also their opposition to the Republican amendment.

959
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:55.000
I do not have the clairvoyance that my colleague has and therefore am not able to decide why certain people took one position while others took another position.

960
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.500
I can only speak from my very narrow perspective.

961
01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:08.500
As you are well aware, three times in the last three years, I proposed an independent redistricting commission.

962
01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:19.500
Twice, got as far as the governor's desk where he vetoed, and third, I did not even get approval in the House.

963
01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:36.500
And I must say that I took that approach because while I hope for the best always and hope that our better angels will govern our behavior, I like to prepare for the worst.

964
01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:54.000
I had no doubt in my mind that if the Democrats were in control in 2020, that they would try to find a way to put their fingers on the scale to help Democratic causes.

965
01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:15.500
and I understood that this was not something that is restricted from one party to another but the independent redistricting Commission issue has left the station it's over and done with so we are here left with the situation as we find it.

966
01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:26.500
And while we are legislators and not doctors, I think it is still relevant to say, first, let us do no harm.

967
01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:29.500
And then go on from there.

968
01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:44.000
I have heard in the debates that we've had in the last few weeks about 538, an independent body, that in 2018 developed congressional maps for the entire country.

969
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.500
And I then went to the site.

970
01:23:47.500 --> 01:24:01.000
And if I, as I found out, as you all would find out if you go to that site, that they drew maps using eight different standards.

971
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:08.000
One of the standards was how would you construct congressional districts in New Hampshire.

972
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Thank you.

973
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:18.500
One of the standards was how would you construct congressional districts in New Hampshire to benefit Republicans.

974
01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:33.000
And lo and behold, when you look at the map, it is exactly the same map that our colleague presented to us here, and that is before us now.

975
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Exactly.

976
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:44.500
It is exactly the same map that our colleague presented to us here, and that is before us now.

977
01:24:44.500 --> 01:25:01.500
Exactly the same map with that arc going again from the Connecticut River to the Atlantic Ocean, and with a figure in the middle that, to me, looks like a gentleman raising his fist.

978
01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:05.000
That's just the visuals that I see.

979
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:14.000
And that was the map that should be drawn if what you wanted to do was favor Republicans.

980
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000
But that's not the whole story.

981
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:32.500
Because if you then went to the next analysis as what would the map look like if you wanted to favor Democrats, lo and behold, it was exactly the same map.

982
01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:41.500
So we have been talking up until now about the question as to whether this map favors Republicans.

983
01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:51.500
But in fact, if this map were presented in another context, our discussion should be, does this map favor Democrats?

984
01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:59.500
And I would say to you that the answer to both of those questions is yes.

985
01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:09.000
And therefore, in good conscience, I cannot be part of supporting a map that predetermines Republican or Democratic success.

986
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000
I would have preferred an independent redistricting commission.

987
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.500
We do not have that.

988
01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:31.000
What we have instead is the fact that since the late 1800s, the map in New Hampshire for the two congressional districts has been very roughly the same over the years.

989
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:45.500
It wasn't until the 1970 map that we had to address issues of one man, one vote, because it wasn't until then that the Supreme Court established those principles.

990
01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:50.500
In all those years, Nonetheless, the map stayed the same.

991
01:26:50.500 --> 01:27:00.500
And the point that must be emphasized is never in that entire period were the Democrats in charge of redistricting.

992
01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:06.000
In every decade, it was the Republicans in charge of redistricting.

993
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Ten years ago in this state, under the then speaker, who was a very forceful Republican advocate, and where major changes were made in all kinds of ways that the government functioned, nonetheless, that redistricting committee and that legislature voted to basically keep the district lines the same and not make any dramatic changes.

994
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:56.000
This is the first time that a Republican-controlled committee is proposing a dramatic change that instead of moving one town of 9,000 people from one district to another, that would equalize the districts that began with the 18,000, roughly 18,000, where they were out of sync.

995
01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:10.500
Instead, the proposal we have before us basically readjusts the districts for about 25% of the citizens of the state, 360,000, something like that, in 75 cities and towns.

996
01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:18.500
Those are dramatic changes, and there ought to be a dramatic reason to make those changes.

997
01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:36.500
I do not think that adopting an alternative that would be the alternative if you wanted to guarantee that Democrats would win in one district and Republicans in another without very much of a fair fight.

998
01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:54.500
I don't think that that is a solution that should be applied to a situation which is not in crisis and which has been supported consistently by the majority in the legislature in every decennial census.

999
01:28:54.500 --> 01:29:17.000
So, Madam Chair, I very, very hopefully ask all of my colleagues to think carefully about what they are proposing here and whether this dramatic change is necessary and appropriate and part of carrying out our obligation to all of the citizens of the state.

1000
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Thank you.

1001
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.500
Thank you, Representative Marjorie Smith.

1002
01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:32.000
Is there anybody else who wishes to speak to the motion on the floor, which is Amendment 2271 to HB 52?

1003
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Representative Stephen Smith.

1004
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1005
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I want dramatic change.

1006
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:49.500
I live in CD2, and I've been doing this for a decade and a half, not in the House, but involved with politics.

1007
01:29:49.500 --> 01:30:04.000
I'm tired of CD1 being neat and tidy, and then the district that I live in, CD2, having Nashua, Colebrook, the Connecticut River towns included, doesn't make any sense.

1008
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.500
It's about time that that dynamic changed.

1009
01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:15.500
Just because we've always done it before, that's never a good reason to keep doing something.

1010
01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:21.000
So maybe this way CD1 will say, wow, we're inconvenienced too.

1011
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:28.500
Maybe 10 years from now we can get together and find an even better solution.

1012
01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:44.000
But until we break the stranglehold on the status quo and a CD2 that, frankly, supports incumbency because there are too many places to go, it isn't going to get better.

1013
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.500
So for that reason, I want the dramatic change.

1014
01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:59.500
I also want to address what I think might be a bit of hubris in the room on both sides, guaranteed outcomes.

1015
01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:02.000
That isn't going to happen.

1016
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:10.500
Nobody here, and especially me, is smart enough to come up with a plan to do that.

1017
01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:19.500
And I say that because in 2007, my role was to recruit candidates to run for the statehouse.

1018
01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:27.000
And there was one district in my county I couldn't get anybody to run for.

1019
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
You know why?

1020
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Impossible.

1021
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Double-digit Democrat advantage.

1022
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:39.000
There's no way any Republican's going to get elected in that town.

1023
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:48.500
When I failed to recruit anybody, the people I talked to said, well, you're the one running your mouth.

1024
01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:51.000
Why don't you do it?

1025
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Kind of hard to back away from that.

1026
01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:03.500
And now I'm in my sixth term in a district that was guaranteed to be a Democrat.

1027
01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:09.500
Nobody is going to guarantee anything, especially when populations shift, attitudes change.

1028
01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:23.500
We don't know what brilliant candidate may show up on either side that will change people's minds, because undeclared voters decide our elections, not Republicans and not Democrats.

1029
01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:42.500
So I can support this congressional plan because it's a dramatic change that breaks our stranglehold on the status quo, which I guess if you're in CD1 is okay, but it isn't doing us CD2 people any favors.

1030
01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:50.500
And that I know personally that there's no such thing as a guarantee, no guaranteed outcome.

1031
01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:53.500
That's all I have, Madam Chair.

1032
01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:55.500
Thank you.

1033
01:32:55.500 --> 01:33:03.000
Is there further discussion by committee members in regards to the matter on the floor?

1034
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Representative Bergeron.

1035
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1036
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:24.500
When the first speaker was addressing the amendment, he asked a rhetorical question, why not bring in the towns of Hudson and Wyndham and Litchfield and Pelham if he was bringing Litchfield into the district?

1037
01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:27.500
Immediately my question was, well, why?

1038
01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:31.000
I don't want to know why not.

1039
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.500
I wanted to know why.

1040
01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:44.500
And the second speaker rather answered that and indicated that the decision was made to align residents who had common political leanings.

1041
01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:56.500
I didn't hear mentions of any other types of communities of interest, whether it's geographical features, tourism, industry, commerce, shared political boundaries, shared services.

1042
01:33:56.500 --> 01:34:02.000
It just seemed to be driven by the residents' political leanings.

1043
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:18.000
The little creature that's now going to be embedded in the state of New Hampshire, I had asked people on my Twitter account to try and describe what they thought it was.

1044
01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:30.000
I hadn't heard the one about a fist, but I did hear one about a beggar's cup being right inside of the state's boundaries.

1045
01:34:30.000 --> 01:35:18.500
When the term gerrymandering came around because a similar district was created, not of the similar shape, it was created to align people with common political leanings, and it looked like a salamander or a dragon hence the term gerrymandering was created I don't know what this little beggar boy with the cup is going to ultimately be called but it's going to become a symbol for gerrymandering 21st century symbol for gerrymandering and I don't think that's a sufficient reason to create that kind of figure as a congressional district in the state of New Hampshire.

1046
01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:25.000
And I will be opposing the motion to amend as presented thus far.

1047
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:30.500
Is there any further discussion on the amendment on the floor?

1048
01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:32.500
Representative Berry.

1049
01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:34.500
Yes.

1050
01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:40.500
To address Representative Bergeron's statement about this becoming in the history books.

1051
01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:46.000
You know, respectfully, Representative, I look at the state of Illinois.

1052
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
I look at Maryland.

1053
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.000
I look at Massachusetts, what's currently happening there.

1054
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:59.000
This district is far more compact than anything Democrats have done in other states.

1055
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Anything.

1056
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
It just is.

1057
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.500
I'm happy to compare them.

1058
01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:10.000
You know, I find it very telling with this.

1059
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:16.000
You know, I followed this process now, you know, my entire life.

1060
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:33.000
And I look at, I remember when we did the public input session, the ACLU spoke and they made a lot of references and they never made a constitutional argument against the proposed map.

1061
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:39.500
And then I looked at what the ACLU was saying in other states.

1062
01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:48.000
The ACLU attacks Ohio, North Carolina, Texas, but it's silent on California and New York and Illinois.

1063
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:55.000
So it just all rings hollow at this It just it just rings hollow.

1064
01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:15.500
If we're going to hold up examples of of bad you know aggressive gerrymandering they're going to look at Illinois first where Governor Pritzer ran promising an independent redistricting commission then he immediately flip-flops says nope not going to use that.

1065
01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:28.500
Then when Independent Redistricting Commission was going to kick in because the data was delayed, they used American survey data, illegal data, to pass illegal maps.

1066
01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:41.500
That by the way, many minority groups began to sue over, all to avoid a quote-unquote independent redistricting commission so that they could draw the maps.

1067
01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:46.000
It's just, respectively, Representative Bergeron, it just rings hollow.

1068
01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:56.500
If they're going to hold this up as an example, I would bet my bottom dollar they're looking at Illinois first.

1069
01:37:56.500 --> 01:38:02.500
Is there further discussion on the amendment, which is before the committee?

1070
01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:04.500
Representative Weber?

1071
01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:11.500
I just wish to state that this is not any of those other states.

1072
01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:13.500
This is New Hampshire.

1073
01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:23.000
And we are legislating for the people of New Hampshire without reference to what happens in any other state.

1074
01:38:23.000 --> 01:39:26.500
And I am stating that because it's what I hear an awful lot in committee sessions about many many different issues but it is most important when it comes to redistricting thank you from the representative who reminded me first that New Hampshire is either first or last on most issues and we try to deal with things in our New Hampshire way I'll just say that I actually asked a couple people about these two maps and I got a stronger reaction against the current map than the proposed map before this committee today so as in many things it is in the eye of the beholder what looks more appropriate and I will say I showed those maps without telling people what they were when.

1075
01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:35.000
I would also point out, because there was some question about relation, these maps meet constitutional requirements.

1076
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
They meet them.

1077
01:39:37.000 --> 01:40:30.000
And then we have choices as to proceed, which the voters have, in a sense, done that by the elections that just occurred here in the state I will point out that for me one thing that I am happy with the proposed CD map lines that I will be voting in favor of as to the amendment is I have been on a regional Planning Commission for many years in my area it brings more of those towns together and the lower part of the 93 corridor has been a major issue for federal funding and expansion that we've had a lot of difficulties with.

1078
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:50.500
This is a state with lots of different characteristics, and I suspect we can all put our thumb on a map of the state and find something within it that would bind it together or not make it cohesive at all.

1079
01:40:50.500 --> 01:41:05.000
So I know that this map is proposed meets the constitutional requirements, and I think it's a better fair map, so I will be voting in favor of it.

1080
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Is there further discussion on the amendment on on the floor representative Wayne thank you madam chair I'll be brief since a lot of what I'm gonna say has already been said I would point out that representing your constituents means giving them a fair map as fair as possible it means having the courage as much as possible to put politics aside and give people a fair map a map That has a chance to elect someone from either party This map undermines voter confidence.

1081
01:41:48.000 --> 01:42:00.500
It moves 25% of New Hampshire's population to create one safe seat for Republicans as promised by the head of the party earlier this year.

1082
01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:12.000
We all have one we all have a constitutional duty to honor the underpinnings of our democracy which is one person one vote.

1083
01:42:12.000 --> 01:43:55.500
This map as proposed does not do that and violates that promise thank you representative lane is there any further comment on the motion before the floor which is amendment 2021 22 71 to hb 52 representative simpson oh i'm sorry representative simpson thank you madam chair i i'll be brief and i'm sorry to repeat myself from a couple of weeks ago um i just want to note that i reside in the seacoast community and it will be inconvenient if this map passes and the seacoast is broken up into two different congressional districts the seacoast shares a lot in common socially and economically especially um so i wanted to note that again and then also um to say that i um i want another word for backfill representative barry i trust that the public servant elected to cd2 in the next 10 years will um not treat anyone in their district as backfill but will represent whomever they are given by the maps that we vote in today thank you thank you any further comment from committee members on the amendment which is on the floor seeing none i'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll the vote is on amendment 2021-22-71H.

Representative Marjorie Smith.

1097
01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:23.500
No.

1098
01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:25.500
Representative Bergeron.

1099
01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:27.500
No.

1100
01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:29.500
Representative Lane.

1101
01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:31.500
No.

1102

Representative Piedra.

1103

No.

1104

Representative Webber.

No.

1106
01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:41.500
Representative Wilhelm.

1107
01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:43.500
No.

1108
01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.500

1110
01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:08.000
do you have your red thing push your microphone thoughts ah is that better sorry about that.

1111
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:13.000
I move amendment 2021, 2245 H to house bill 52.

1112
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Is there a second?

1113
01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Second.

1114
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.500
Representative Weber seconds the motion.

1115
01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:24.500
Representative Smith, would you like to speak to your motion?

1116
01:45:24.500 --> 01:46:05.500
I would like to speak to my motion on the basic principle principle that if at first you don't succeed try try again on that principle I present to you an amendment that keeps the district lines roughly the way they have been in this state for time immemorial with one very small change in which one town of 9,000 people moves from District 1 to District 2 in order to end up with two very close districts in terms of population.

1117
01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:23.000
I believe that this is a proposal that makes a great deal of sense and makes it somewhat clear among other things to our constituents as to where they are and where they will be.

1118
01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Thank you.

1119
01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:34.000
somewhat clear among other things to our constituents as to where they are and where they will be.

1120
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.500
I will just say one other thing.

1121
01:46:37.500 --> 01:47:00.500
Last summer, before the Census Bureau released the figures, I was told by an important member of the Senate staff in this state that they, he, was going to make sure that there was a district drawn which had Durham, Hanover, Plymouth, and Keene in it.

1122
01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:02.500
And I laughed.

1123
01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:05.500
I thought it was a joke.

1124
01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:09.000
I thought it was really quite amusing.

1125
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:22.000
And I did not see it as an indication of the importance that my colleague gave to higher education, which was why he suggested those towns.

1126
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:29.500
In fact, I shouldn't have left because that is what we have before us now.

1127
01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:54.500
That was, as I say, last July, so certainly not a new idea, but I again say to you that I hope that you will reconsider your vote on the First Amendment and recognize the value of continuity in a state which is in, a purple state in many ways.

1128
01:47:54.500 --> 01:48:15.000
I give you the governor, the House, the Senate, the congressional delegation, and recognize that this proposal makes it possible for Republicans and independents independents and Democrats in each of the two districts to have a solid chance to be represented.

1129
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:31.500
And since it's a member of the first congressional district, I know that we have had Democratic representatives and Republican representatives in recent years helping to reassert the value of a purple district.

1130
01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:47.500
And my last point is, in my earlier conversation, I alluded to the fact that if the Democrats were in control, they might very well have come up with the same map.

1131
01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:58.500
And I would have opposed it by saying to my Democratic colleagues, why would you settle for the possibility of one seat?

1132
01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:07.000
Don't you have enough confidence and faith in your arguments that you might really win two seats?

1133
01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:13.000
So half a loaf in this case is not better than none.

1134
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:29.000
And I urge you to support, well, let me put it this way, a guarantee of half a loaf is not better than a chance that you might get a whole loaf.

1135
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:34.500
And on that basis, I ask you to support Amendment 2245.

1136
01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:36.500
Thank you.

1137
01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:39.500
The amendment is on the floor.

1138
01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:45.000
Is there anybody else that wishes to speak to the motion?

1139
01:49:45.000 --> 01:50:05.500
I'm seeing seeing none so I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll representative Stephen Smith no representative McGuire no representative Turcotte no representative McDonald votes no representative Lynn no representative Barry no representative Alexander no Representative Marjorie Smith.

1140
01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:07.500
No.

1141
01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:09.500
Representative Lynn.

1142
01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:11.500

1208
01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:04.500
Representative Griffin.

1209
01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:06.500

Madam Chair?

1212
01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Representative Smith.

1213
01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:21.500
Madam Chair, there will be a minority report, and it will be ought to pass as amended.

1214
01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:23.500
Thank you.

1215
01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:28.500
The next item to take up will be HB 50.

1216
01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:32.000
That will be the state representative districts.

1217
01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000
We are going to take a short break.

1218
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:58.500
We will be back at 10 of by my clock and it is 2.41 now so that's nine minutes according to my digital guide Madam Chair, there will also in all likelihood be a minority report on the commissioners When do you need those by?

1219
01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:02.500
Well, reports are due out this week, so.

1220
01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:04.500
Okay.

1221
01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:06.500
Got it.

1222
01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:08.500
What's today, Tuesday?

1223
01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:20.000
So really by the end of tomorrow to make sure that I can get to them and get them to the clerk's office.

1224
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:25.500
Well, they're not gonna be acted on until next year, so.

1225
01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:37.000
I had this discussion with the clerk about when my committee reports had to get out, and he told me- Okay, enough said.

1226
01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.000
It was Thursday and I didn't.

1227
01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Thank you.

1228
01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Thank you.

1229
01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Thank you.

1230
01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Thank you.

1231
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Thank you.

1232
01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Thank you.

1233
01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Thank you.

1234
01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Thank you.

1235
01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Thank you.

1236
01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Thank you.

1237
01:55:00.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Representative McGuire, before I ask you to speak to your vote, I want to say this because I will forget it at the end these bills have many districts we have attempted OLS has attempted to compile these based on the information provided I know that information that OLS got for at least the majority amendments was directly off the mapping program that we used which then requires them to go through by town and put it into counties the reason I'm saying that is and I have passed out maps for what we are voting on is because I think without looking at the specifics of the actual bill language it is fairly clear what we have intended to vote on so if anyone is looking at one of these bills and finds either something is not as I did in one, not quite in alphabetical order, or there is some minor change that does not affect the substance of what we voted, can you please let me know?

1238
01:56:25.000 --> 01:57:03.500
Because I will have a conversation with staff and the clerk as to whether or not it was an inadvertent error That can be corrected just in the course of the bill Processing So that we don't have to deal with any changes and I say that because These amendments were flying around pretty late as is quite often in committees And this is a little more complicated than just reading sentences out loud to each other.

1239
01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:07.000
There's a lot of districts and numbers.

1240
01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:24.500
So I'm just saying that for everybody to keep in mind, because I know when we're done, you're all gonna wanna go home and read all of these again to go over what we did.

1241
01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:27.500
So thank you for your indulgence.

1242
01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:33.000
Representative McGuire, if you would like to speak to your motion.

1243
01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1244
01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:42.500
One, the process we used is that these maps meet federal and state constitutional criteria.

1245
01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:54.500
The first step was to agree on 400 representatives and then allocate them to the counties, and that was done by unanimous committee votes.

1246
01:57:54.500 --> 01:58:45.000
We used component method of computation Which was used 10 years ago and has been approved by our Supreme Court This amendment represents districts within counties which are created meeting the usual definition of reasonable deviation Which is 10% all districts are contiguous no town or ward boundaries were broken all towns are in a non-flow terial district and some have a flow terial in order to meet the representation required as we voted by committee unanimously they assumed that the cities will draw their war lines so all wards have equal population, which is also necessary for fair city elections.

1247
01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:54.500
Where possible and practical, we created single-town districts when it would not deprive another town of its fair representation.

1248
01:58:54.500 --> 01:59:02.500
Where possible and practical, we kept cities within their boundaries, not sharing districts with adjoining town.

1249
01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:09.500
This does contain revisions to the maps we presented to the public last week.

1250
01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:21.000
These changes were based on public comment, other maps submitted to the committee for consideration, and our continued attempts to draw better maps.

1251
01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Thank you.

1252
01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Thank you, Representative McGuire.

1253
01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:47.000
For committee members, the packet of maps in front of you that says Belknap at the bottom left hand, that is indeed Belknap, but you might want to mark these as being consistent with Amendment 2021, 2274, the amendment that you have before you.

1254
01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:50.500
Is there further discussion on the amendment?

1255
01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:52.500
Representative Piedra.

1256
01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:54.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1257
01:59:54.500 --> 02:00:05.000
I have a specific question about Coas County, just because that is a county that I presented at a working session.

1258
02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:17.000
If I am understanding correctly, the same map has been presented in this amendment as was presented by the majority at the working session.

1259
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:28.000
There's one municipality in Coas that is entitled to its own district under the Constitution, the New Hampshire Constitution, which is Berlin.

1260
02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.500
The minority map maintains Berlin as its own district.

1261
02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:35.000
The majority map does not.

1262
02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:39.500
The two maps have exactly the same deviation ranges.

1263
02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:43.000
One complies with the New Hampshire Constitution.

1264
02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
One does not.

1265
02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
How is that permissible?

1266
02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Thank you, Representative, for your question.

1267
02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Does anybody wish to address that?

1268
02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Representative Turcotte.

1269
02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1270
02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Thanks for the question.

1271
02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Berlin is the only town within co-AS that exceeds the 3444 ideal number if you will.

1272
02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:17.000
There are multiple instances within other counties where the minorities maps have failed to accomplish what you're asking for here.

1273
02:01:17.000 --> 02:02:25.500
On map we decided that it was best to pair Berlin with Jefferson and avoid a large flotereal that was on the minorities map so just like in many of the counties there were trade-offs there were always trade-offs in these maps anybody who's spent any time drawing these maps know that there is no perfect solution in fact i recall somebody on the minority side at the very beginning of this process says there are no perfect solutions and that indeed is the case so in co-host what it comes down to is a really a you know the trade-offs and what each party decides thank you follow up madam chair um follow up i'm really not trying to i'll decide if you're doing whatever you think you're doing so go ahead Perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

1274
02:02:25.500 --> 02:03:05.000
Do you agree with me that the Republican majority map does not comply with the New Hampshire Constitution, but has the exact same deviation range as a minority map, which comply with the new hampshire constitution and i am going to answer that question for you as i am a sponsor on the amendment and i do not agree with you next comment representative lane i said i do not agree with him so you follow up madam share?

1275
02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:09.500
One time, and then we're going to move on.

1276
02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:30.500
I think it's an important point because as far as I know, if there are two maps that both have the same deviation range, that are both compliant with one person, one vote, we still have to follow the New Hampshire Constitution.

1277
02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:39.000
We don't just get to throw it out because in other situations we can't comply with it.

1278
02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:44.500
If we can comply with it, it's not just a suggestion.

1279
02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:52.500
It's not we think a flotarial is not as good of an idea for policy reasons.

1280
02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:57.000
We have to comply with the New Hampshire Constitution.

1281
02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.500
At least that's my understanding.

1282
02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:02.000
And so I don't understand.

1283
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:10.500
Maybe you could explain why it is your opinion, Madam Chair, that the Republican map is constitutional.

1284
02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:16.000
I consider that question asked and answered by Representative Turcotte's response.

1285
02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:37.000
And perhaps you can go into your logic more because you might have an amendment for Coas County thank you further questions on the amendment before the committee the amendment before the committee is an amendment to HB 50 2021 2021, 2274.

1286
02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:45.500
I'm not seeing any further questions, so I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll.

1287
02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:47.500
Representative Stephen Smith.

1288
02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:49.500
Yes.

1289
02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:51.500

Yes.

1291

Representative Turki.

1292
02:04:55.500 --> 02:04:57.500

Representative Alexander?

1304

Yes.

1305
02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:23.500
Representative Marjorie Smith?

1306
02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:25.500
Yes.

1307
02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:27.500
Representative Bergeron?

1308
02:05:27.500 --> 02:05:29.500
Yes.

1309
02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:31.500
Representative Lane?

1310
02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:33.500
Yes.

1311
02:05:33.500 --> 02:05:35.500
Representative Piedra?

1312
02:05:35.500 --> 02:05:37.500
Yes.

1313
02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:39.500
Representative Webber?

1314
02:05:39.500 --> 02:05:41.500
No.

1315
02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:43.500
Representative Wilhelm.

1316
02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:45.500
No.

1317
02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:47.500
Representative Simpson.

1318
02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:49.500
No.

1319
02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:51.500
Representative Griffin.

1320
02:05:51.500 --> 02:05:53.500
Yes.

1321
02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:56.000
12 to 3, Madam Chairman.

1322
02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:02.000
The vote on Amendment 20, 21, 22, 74 was 12 to 3.

1323
02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
The amendment passes.

1324
02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:08.000
HB 50 remains open for further committee amendment.

1325
02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Is there a motion?

1326
02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Representative Smith.

1327
02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Could I ask a question first?

1328
02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:26.500
There have been other amendments which were prepared by OLS, and I told Distributed to the committee and for the life of me.

1329
02:06:26.500 --> 02:06:36.000
I can't find them in the sea of paper for example, I submitted an amendment Concerning those Stratford County.

1330
02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.500
No, I have a stack.

1331
02:06:38.500 --> 02:07:04.500
Let's make this clear I have a stack of amendments to I have an amendment to HB 50 in front of me Madam chair, there's a number of amendments in that package Right, that's what I thought do you have that package if you don't let's figure out what the paper, okay?

1332
02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:33.500
The the first one in the stapled packet which should it's similar to put together similar to how the county commissioners were The first amendment should be representative Bergeron and the amendment number is 2251 and the last amendment the last page is an amendment by representative Simpson 2260 I want to make It was partly down that.

1333
02:07:33.500 --> 02:07:39.000
I want to make sure everybody's got it before we continue.

1334
02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
You don't have it.

1335
02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Are there extra copies there, Christine?

1336
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:49.000
It's part way down the packet that we were given.

1337
02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Excuse me, Madam Chair.

1338
02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:54.500
Let's just make sure everybody's got it.

1339
02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:56.500
Excuse me.

1340
02:07:56.500 --> 02:07:58.500
Oh, I'm sorry.

1341
02:07:58.500 --> 02:08:00.500
Representative Simpson.

1342
02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:02.500
Oh, no, that's fine.

1343
02:08:02.500 --> 02:08:10.000
I did notice that Representative Lane and Representative Smiths are not part of the packet.

1344
02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:13.000
They're separate individual pieces of paper.

1345
02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.500
Oh, I don't do those.

1346
02:08:15.500 --> 02:08:21.000
I don't know that I saw them over on that table.

1347
02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:26.500
I don't know whether I have them in front of me.

1348
02:08:26.500 --> 02:08:28.500
It's 22.

1349
02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:30.500
No, they're separate, right?

1350
02:08:30.500 --> 02:08:55.500
Yeah, they're they're because they were the last ones that came over from ols yeah okay so it's 2243 and 2275 that are separate from that christina i i'm not sure i have do other members have the two separate amendments from lane and All right right, let me look.

1351
02:08:55.500 --> 02:08:59.000
Maybe – I have apparently gotten lost.

1352
02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1353
02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:05.000
You're in an odd order, but that's okay.

1354
02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Madam Chair.

1355
02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Representative Bergeron.

1356
02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Further question, now that we all seem to have our papers together.

1357
02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
I don't.

1358
02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:26.500
Will we be taking up these further amendments in numerical order as they're stapled together or in alphabetical order?

1359
02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:34.000
I will leave that to you to decide how you would like to do it.

1360
02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Thank you.

1361
02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:41.000
It was easier to deal with on the county commissioners.

1362
02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
I understand that.

1363
02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:49.000
So if you want to take a moment to decide that's fine.

1364
02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.000
I found my two single amendments.

1365
02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.500
The Smith and Lane ones.

1366
02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:59.500
I prefer alphabetical but they're stapled in a different order.

1367
02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:39.000
Well we can figure it out okay can i assume that there is an amendment please madam chair can i assume there's an amendment to every county i believe there's an amendment to all but one perhaps all right so let's let's start i think there is one for every county all right so let's look for belknap county i believe that is the second page in the stapled packet that would appear to be 2250 to Representative Wilhelm.

1368
02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:46.000
In an effort to help this along, would you like to make a motion?

1369
02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:50.500
Madam Chair, I'm going to waive off this amendment.

1370
02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:52.500
Okay.

1371
02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:56.500
Carroll County would be the next county alphabetically.

1372
02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:59.500
Carroll County is a pew in.

1373
02:10:59.500 --> 02:11:04.000
Representative Bergeron, would you like to make a motion?

1374
02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.500
Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.

1375
02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:14.500
I would like to move the passage of Amendment 2021-2256 to further amend House Bill 50.

1376
02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:18.500
And I'd like to speak to that motion.

1377
02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:22.500
Is there a second to Representative Bergeron's motion?

1378
02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:24.500
Representative Lane, second it.

1379
02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:26.500
Representative Bergeron.

1380
02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:28.500
Thank you.

1381
02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:37.000
This amendment addresses two issues which the minority tried to address in a lot of its maps.

1382
02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Specifically, when large geographic districts were being created or floterios were being created, we wanted to keep them as small as practicable.

1383
02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:57.500
We also wanted to try and give communities that were entitled to their own state representatives their own district.

1384
02:11:57.500 --> 02:11:59.500
This amendment achieves that.

1385
02:11:59.500 --> 02:12:12.500
This amendment has a largest fluterial district of five towns, whereas the one that's contained in the amendment just passed contains six towns in that district.

1386
02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:26.500
We also give Moulton Borough its own state representative district, which does not occur in the Republican plan, and therefore we would ask for passage of this amendment.

1387
02:12:26.500 --> 02:12:28.500
Thank you.

1388
02:12:28.500 --> 02:12:35.000
Is there further discussion on the motion on the floor, which is 2256?

1389
02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
I'm seeing none.

1390
02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Is the clerk ready to call the roll?

1391
02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Yes.

1392
02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
Representative Stephen Smith?

1393
02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
No.

1394
02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Representative McGuire?

1395
02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
No.

1396
02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Representative Turquard?

1397
02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
No.

1398
02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Representative McDonald votes no.

1399
02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
So, represent...

1400
02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
No.

1401
02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
Representative McGuire.

1402
02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
No.

1403
02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Representative Turcotte.

1404
02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
No.

1405
02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Representative McDonald votes no.

1406
02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Representative Lynn.

1407
02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
No.

1408
02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Representative Barry.

1409
02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
No.

1410
02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Representative Alexander.

1411
02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
No.

1412
02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
Representative Marjorie Smith.

1413
02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Yes.

1414
02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Representative Bergeron.

1415
02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Yes.

1416
02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Representative Lane.

1417
02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Yes.

1418
02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Representative Piedra.

1419
02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Yes.

1420
02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Representative Bergeron.

1421
02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Yes.

1422
02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Representative Lane.

1423
02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Yes.

1424
02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
Representative Piedra.

1425
02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Yes.

1426
02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Representative Webber.

1427
02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Yes.

1428
02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Representative Wilhelm.

1429
02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Yes.

1430
02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Representative Simpson.

1431
02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Yes.

1432
02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Representative Griffin.

1433
02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
No.

1434
02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.500
Motion fails seven to eight.

1435
02:14:09.500 --> 02:14:15.500
HB 50 as amended remains on the floor open to further amendment.

1436
02:14:15.500 --> 02:14:20.000
Is there an amendment in regards to Cheshire County?

1437
02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Yes, Madam Chair.

1438
02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:29.500
I would like to move amendment 2021-2259H, and it's towards the back of your packet.

1439
02:14:29.500 --> 02:14:33.500
Is there a second to Representative Weber's motion?

1440
02:14:33.500 --> 02:14:35.500
I'll second, Madam Chair.

1441
02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:38.000
Representative Bergeron seconds the motion.

1442
02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Representative Weber, would you like to speak to your motion?

1443
02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Yes, please.

1444
02:14:45.000 --> 02:15:05.000
I'm a little bit at a disadvantage because the majority amendment Cheshire map showed up in my inbox at 1026 this morning, and I actually learned of its existence at 1240, but I'm going to do the best I can.

1445
02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:38.500
I see that the amendment has addressed certain concerns by giving each of the Keene wards their own dedicated representative, and in in that respect it is a step in the right direction but i also note that with respect to the map that i have offered nine of the 12 jurisdictions that are entitled to one or two of their own dedicated representatives actually get them.

1446
02:15:38.500 --> 02:15:48.000
And in this one, I think there are two, there are only seven of the 12 that get them.

1447
02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:56.000
In any case, Walpole, Chesterfield, Hinsdale, Jaffrey and Swansea are still left hitched to other towns.

1448
02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.500
So that's item number one.

1449
02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:18.000
And in the amendment that I am proposing, nine of the 12 get their own dedicated representative and the deviation for that is 6.72% as opposed to what I believe is now an 8.62% deviation for the majority amendment.

1450
02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:35.500
The other concern I have, the amendment that I am submitting better fits the requests of people who came before us who almost unanimously said that they wanted smaller districts with smaller numbers of representatives.

1451
02:16:35.500 --> 02:17:07.500
And so the proposed amendment keeps districts, even when aggregated or flotereals, relatively local, as opposed to the map that I have in front of me from the majority amendment, which has one gigantic floterial, including the city of Keene and all of the western portion of the county, and then several other very large floterials as well that completely ignore communities of interest.

1452
02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:21.500
So I think that the suggestion that I am proposing more is closer to being constitutional under the New Hampshire Constitution, and therefore I would urge its adoption.

1453
02:17:21.500 --> 02:17:23.500
Thank you, Representative Weber.

1454
02:17:23.500 --> 02:17:28.000
Would anybody else like to speak to the motion?

1455
02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Representative Turcotte.

1456
02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1457
02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:42.500
Speaking to the new map that we have proposed that you received yesterday, I guess, we initially No, we did not.

1458
02:17:42.500 --> 02:17:45.000
She was referring to AM.

1459
02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Oh, AM?

1460
02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
1029 AM today.

1461
02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
Oh, okay.

1462
02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Gotcha.

1463
02:17:53.000 --> 02:18:14.000
What we did from our original submission is we noted that there were ways to increase the number of districts, districts, increase the number of single town districts, and make our map quite a bit more… I'm searching for the exact word.

1464
02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:18.500
You only get another five seconds to find it.

1465
02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:35.000
But anyway, to improve our maps dramatically from the one that we submitted, I will make note that large fluterials appear in the state in several counties, in many of the minority's counties.

1466
02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:40.000
That's not unique I Will note that in this map.

1467
02:18:40.000 --> 02:19:03.500
There is a district that Should get its own District that on either map doesn't get it I Will note also that when we look at deviations Some are looking at the deviations by a county, yet the maximum and minimum deviations are on a statewide basis.

1468
02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:17.000
So if we have a low one in one county and a high one in another county, that's the number that we're looking at for the 10%.

1469
02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:48.500
Also, as far as single town districts and districts as a whole and flotereals again we look at that on a statewide basis when you look at the totals because there are some counties where we greatly exceed the minorities maps in all those categories and there are other other maps where you have been able to do that on a smaller basis.

1470
02:19:48.500 --> 02:19:53.000
So that's what I have to say regarding Cheshire.

1471
02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Thank you.

1472
02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:59.000
Further discussion on the amendment on the floor?

1473
02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
It's 2021-2259.

1474
02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Seeing none, I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll.

1475
02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
Representative Stephen Smith.

1476
02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
No.

1477
02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Representative McGuire.

1478
02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
No.

1479
02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
Representative Tercott.

1480
02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
No.

1481
02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Representative McDonald votes no.

1482
02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Representative Lynn.

1483
02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
No.

1484
02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Representative Berry.

1485
02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
No.

1486
02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Representative Alexander.

1487
02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
No.

1488
02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:39.500
piedra yes representative weber yes representative wilhelm yes representative simpson yes Representative Griffin.

1489
02:20:39.500 --> 02:21:01.000
no motion fails at seven to eight hb 50 remains on the floor as amended by 2274 is there a further amendment co-host representative paedra thank you madam chair um it's already kind of made my point to to a certain extent, but...

1490
02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Co-op, Representative Piedra.

1491
02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1492
02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:13.500
I've already kind of made my point to a certain extent, but this is one of those.

1493
02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:17.000
You still need to move the amendment.

1494
02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.500
I will move amendment number.

1495
02:21:19.500 --> 02:21:21.500
Thank you.

1496
02:21:21.500 --> 02:21:23.500
2021-2253.

1497
02:21:23.500 --> 02:21:25.500
Thank you.

1498
02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:27.500
Is there a second?

1499
02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:29.500
Second.

1500
02:21:29.500 --> 02:21:31.500
Thank you, Representative Weber.

1501
02:21:31.500 --> 02:21:35.000
Go ahead and speak to your motion.

1502
02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
Thanks Madam Chair.

1503
02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:49.500
As I was saying, this was one of those rare situations where we actually can comply with the New Hampshire Constitution without changing anything else.

1504
02:21:49.500 --> 02:21:59.500
Again, the deviation ranges for the minority map and the majority amendment that was just adopted are exactly the same.

1505
02:21:59.500 --> 02:22:05.500
So the county remains the same deviation-wise as does the overall state.

1506
02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:14.000
In this amendment that's being offered, Berlin retains its own district, which is what the Constitution requires.

1507
02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:37.000
I think it's unavoidable that we have to do that or some other alternative that maintains Berlin in its own district and so the interests of the New Hampshire taxpayers and to avoid a lawsuit about it I suggest we adopt this amendment Representative Smith, Stephen.

1508
02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1509
02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:42.500
So earlier you stated that we disagreed.

1510
02:22:42.500 --> 02:22:44.500
I disagree.

1511
02:22:44.500 --> 02:22:57.500
The New Hampshire Constitution, nowhere in the New Hampshire Constitution, doesn't say that if a town or ward is big enough, it gets its own representative.

1512
02:22:57.500 --> 02:23:23.000
The language passed by the people is, when the population of any town or ward, according to the last federal census, is within a reasonable deviation from the ideal population of one or more representative seats, the town or ward shall have its own district of one or more representative seats.

1513
02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:28.000
So the question then is, is Berlin within reasonable deviation?

1514
02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:37.000
That is a matter of great debate, but what I just did was eliminated the other two towns.

1515
02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Berlin, if you give it three seats, is minus 8.77.

1516
02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:54.500
So that would force the range for the entire state plan to be about 13%, which is outside the 10% guidelines that people generally accept.

1517
02:23:54.500 --> 02:23:57.500
Remember, we don't pass county plans.

1518
02:23:57.500 --> 02:24:00.000
We pass one state plan.

1519
02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
That's the measure.

1520
02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:10.000
So for that reason alone, I can see why Berlin does not get its own representatives.

1521
02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:19.500
Adding Jefferson to it puts it well within the range that we were looking at for the state plan.

1522
02:24:19.500 --> 02:24:28.500
It's also of note that when we looked at Carroll County, Conway actually fits these numbers much better.

1523
02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:38.000
It is less than 5% from being perfect, yet they did not propose that Conway get its own representatives.

1524
02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:43.000
So let's just be consistent and turn down the amendment.

1525
02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:48.500
Further discussion on the amendment on the floor, which is 2253.

1526
02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:50.500
Representative Weber.

1527
02:24:50.500 --> 02:25:04.000
I'm just going to disagree with the statement that a town has to be within a reasonable deviation in order to get its own representative or representatives.

1528
02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:28.000
That is certainly the language of the statute, but if you look at the voters guide and everything else that was written back at the time, people thought they were voting on the proposition that if you had enough people to support one representative, you got your representative.

1529
02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:36.500
I understand it's mathematically impossible, but it just makes no sense to argue it the other way.

1530
02:25:36.500 --> 02:25:38.500
Thank you.

1531
02:25:38.500 --> 02:25:40.500
Thank you, Representative Weber.

1532
02:25:40.500 --> 02:25:42.500
Representative Smith.

1533
02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:45.500
Thank you very much, Madam Chair.

1534
02:25:45.500 --> 02:25:56.500
I wonder if the distinguished Representative Smith, rather than me, could explain what the language means when it says one or more.

1535
02:25:56.500 --> 02:26:09.500
Does that not allow for the fact that the number doesn't have to be exact and that it might be one, two, or three by themselves.

1536
02:26:09.500 --> 02:26:11.500
Sure.

1537
02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:23.000
And again, I'm not trying to interpret anything or guess what any person or persons may have thought when they checked a box.

1538
02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:33.000
I'm just reading the language that was passed that is the law of land, that is the New Hampshire Constitution.

1539
02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Berlin's a great example.

1540
02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:39.500
If you try to apportion those, they're minus 8.77.

1541
02:26:39.500 --> 02:26:41.500
Conway is within 5%.

1542
02:26:41.500 --> 02:26:44.500
That's why you would have multiples.

1543
02:26:44.500 --> 02:26:50.000
So just being big enough, look, we try to do it.

1544
02:26:50.000 --> 02:27:02.000
There were towns in the last redistricting that, by what I've just stated, were not entitled to their own representatives, and they got one.

1545
02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:08.000
But the fact is we've got to stop at the county lines.

1546
02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:14.000
So I think we have done it where we could do it.

1547
02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:24.000
But with the constraints that we have, we can't do it at the expense of the rest of the county.

1548
02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:39.000
And then with Berlin also, it forces the numbers for the state plan, which is what will be judged, not a county plan, far outside the parameters that we have.

1549
02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.500
Further discussion on the amendment?

1550
02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:43.500
Representative Piedra.

1551
02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:49.000
I'm honestly asking, because I may be misunderstanding Representative Smith's point.

1552
02:27:49.000 --> 02:28:08.500
In this proposal, this amendment has the exact same deviations the amendment that was just adopted by the committee how is that going to change the overall state deviation so in your amendment you've given Berlin how many seats?

1553
02:28:08.500 --> 02:28:10.500
Two.

1554
02:28:10.500 --> 02:28:14.500
And what have you done with the excess?

1555
02:28:14.500 --> 02:28:16.500
It's a flotarial.

1556
02:28:16.500 --> 02:28:22.000
I'm happy to provide the breakdown of deviations to the committee.

1557
02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:29.500
It just seems like there's a factual confusion, and there's a question about what's constitutional.

1558
02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:37.500
It seems like we should get it right, but I don't want to belabor the point.

1559
02:28:37.500 --> 02:28:41.500
Well, that's what they make courts for, Representative.

1560
02:28:41.500 --> 02:28:51.500
Isn't that what you just reminded us in regards to threats of a lawsuit if things don't meet the Constitution?

1561
02:28:51.500 --> 02:29:23.500
did hear that from people at our commission meetings I'm a little dismayed that a member of the committee brought it up especially one that's been involved in litigation in the state but I should respond to that madam chair I think that's gratuitous I didn't make a threat I think if we're violating the Constitution that's a legitimate consideration that we should be.

1562
02:29:23.500 --> 02:29:25.500
Okay.

1563
02:29:25.500 --> 02:29:33.500
So I don't appreciate you taking pot shots at me or putting words in my mouth.

1564
02:29:33.500 --> 02:29:35.500
Thank you.

1565
02:29:35.500 --> 02:29:37.500
Thank you.

1566
02:29:37.500 --> 02:31:17.000
I attempt to just take the words as they're stated and said, which also brings me to the point in regards to Representative Weber in regards to what the statute says versus what she might say in the the voter guide I certainly know of the members sitting at this table I am not the one to argue statutory construction and when you need to go outside the bounds of words and so I think we all know that there are things that some people disagree on the interpretation of and people are just going to disagree on what the interpretation of things are so I think that this committee has done a great job in expressing those disagreements and respectfully with each other and I apologize if anybody thinks I wasn't being respectful I understand that these have been long considerations for everybody with a great amount of work for everybody and I really appreciate every member's contribution to the committee and the work that we are doing on the floor is amendment 2021-2253 is there any further discussion on that amendment I'm seeing none I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll representative Stephen Smith.

1567
02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
No.

1568
02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Representative McGuire.

1569
02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
No.

1570
02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Representative Turquard.

1571
02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
No.

1572
02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Representative McDonnell votes no.

1573
02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Representative Lynn.

1574
02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
No.

1575
02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Representative Barry.

1576
02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
No.

1577
02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
Representative Alexander.

1578
02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
No.

1579
02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
Representative Marjorie Smith.

1580
02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
Yes.

1581
02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Representative Bergeron.

1582
02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Yes.

1583
02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Representative Lane.

1584
02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
Yes.

1585
02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Representative Piedra.

1586
02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Yes.

1587
02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
Representative Weber.

1588
02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
Yes.

1589
02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Representative Wilhelm.

1590
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Yes.

1591
02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Representative Simpson.

1592
02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
Yes.

1593
02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Representative Griffin.

1594
02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:27.000
representative Weber yes representative Wilhelm yes representative Simpson yes representative Griffin no vote failed some date 2253 failed HB 50 as amended by 2274 remains on the floor open for further amendment.

1595
02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
Is there an amendment?

1596
02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:32.500
Is there an amendment for Representative Bergeron?

1597
02:32:32.500 --> 02:32:35.000
For Grafton County, Madam Chair.

1598
02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
Thank you.

1599
02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Madam Chair, there is an amendment before the committee, 2021-2251.

1600
02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:46.000
I am not going to propose that amendment.

1601
02:32:46.000 --> 02:33:15.500
I noticed that the was a change in House Bill 50 regarding Grafton County, which awards one seat to each of Lebanon's three wards plus one at large, and I think that carries more value than the amendments I was seeking in other parts of the county, and therefore I will not be offering an amendment to Grafton County.

1602
02:33:15.500 --> 02:33:24.500
Thank you, Representative Bergeron, for clarifying the material, what it did, and what you were hoping to do.

1603
02:33:24.500 --> 02:33:30.500
The motion, the bill on the floor is HB 50 as amended.

1604
02:33:30.500 --> 02:33:33.500
It remains open for further amendment.

1605
02:33:33.500 --> 02:33:35.500
Is there an amendment?

1606
02:33:35.500 --> 02:33:37.500
Representative Wilhelm.

1607
02:33:37.500 --> 02:33:39.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1608
02:33:39.500 --> 02:33:45.500
I'd like to move passage of amendment number 2021-2258H for Hillsborough County.

1609
02:33:45.500 --> 02:33:48.500
Representative Wilhelm has moved amendment 2258.

1610
02:33:48.500 --> 02:33:50.500
Is there a second?

1611
02:33:50.500 --> 02:33:52.500
Second.

1612
02:33:52.500 --> 02:33:55.500
It's been seconded by Representative Weber.

1613
02:33:55.500 --> 02:33:59.500
Would you like to speak to your motion?

1614
02:33:59.500 --> 02:34:02.000
Yes, Madam Chair, thank you.

1615
02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:15.000
There are a couple things, actually it's really just one main one and we heard about it at the public hearings in Reps Hall last week.

1616
02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:25.500
Even though Manchester is entitled to at least 33 house seats, the majority amendment as adopted, it gives Manchester 32 seats.

1617
02:34:25.500 --> 02:34:31.000
And so the Queen City is feeling a little bit shortchanged.

1618
02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.500
This amendment would fix that.

1619
02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:42.500
It'd be slightly larger for territorial districts, but would make sure that Manchester gets its full proportional representation.

1620
02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:47.000
As of the last census, Manchester had 155,644 residents.

1621
02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:56.000
Actually, sorry, I think it's 115, which equates to, I think it's 8.395% of the entire state population.

1622
02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:11.000
Of the 400 house seats, we should be, the city of Manchester, we the royal we of the Queen City, should have 33.58 seats, So that's either 33 or 34.

1623
02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:16.000
So that's really the main purpose of this particular amendment.

1624
02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:19.500
Thank you for speaking to the motion.

1625
02:35:19.500 --> 02:35:23.000
Is there further discussion on the amendment?

1626
02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
Representative Berry.

1627
02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
Yes.

1628
02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:35.500
Would this amendment make the flutterials proposed inside of Manchester larger or smaller than the majority's map?

1629
02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:48.500
Would the flutterial, I just want to make sure I understand the question, would it make the flutterial districts larger or smaller than the majority's map?

1630
02:35:48.500 --> 02:35:50.500
Yeah, the majority amendment.

1631
02:35:50.500 --> 02:36:20.500
both from Manchester how many wards are going in the floats it would be four under this minority amendment and three for the majority amendment okay and you know to that end you know I think of I currently represent 28,000 people it's a lot of work with $100 a year this amendment would send that number to 40,000 people.

1632
02:36:20.500 --> 02:36:25.000
It's a lot of work with $100 a year.

1633
02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:33.500
This amendment would send that number to 40,000, which is I think roughly the population of Bedford.

1634
02:36:33.500 --> 02:36:39.000
Am I doing the back of the envelope math right there?

1635
02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:45.500
That's just too large and unwieldy, so I'll be voting against this amendment.

1636
02:36:45.500 --> 02:36:59.000
Even though I don't feel that the Queen City is getting shafted, I think the Queen City, Queen City would be shorted by flutterials of 40,000 people.

1637
02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
Representative Wilhelm.

1638
02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:14.000
I just want to point out again that the way that the minority proposal is for Hillsborough County, my own electoral prospects are hurt by this.

1639
02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:31.500
And you know know my fluterial district would double in size and we need to start campaigning and twice as many you know sorry in two two wards that I have never campaigned in before.

1640
02:37:31.500 --> 02:37:39.500
But I do think it's important that Manchester gets its its full representation in the Statehouse.

1641
02:37:39.500 --> 02:38:07.000
That statement causes me to wonder what if we change the process to provide that the final maps, each representative had to hold their hand as to whether it would make their future campaigns harder or easier, and then we just let everybody in the room vote, and that would determine what district we adopted.

1642
02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:12.000
And I just said that not out of any disrespect.

1643
02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
It is interesting.

1644
02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:26.000
I want to congratulate this committee because I have not seen to my knowledge any self-serving interests in regards to any of the proposals.

1645
02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:34.000
And I just want to thank everybody for that because I think it is really true.

1646
02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
So anyways, Representative Barry.

1647
02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:51.500
Just to respond to that, I commiserate with you, Representative, and I am very confident in your re-election prospects in the North End if you so choose to go that route.

1648
02:38:51.500 --> 02:39:03.000
My district, if I choose to ran again, which is a big if, would get more competitive as well, so I hear you.

1649
02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
Representative Turcotte.

1650
02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1651
02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:16.500
In response to Representative Wilhelm's point, we do not allocate representatives by city in the state of New Hampshire.

1652
02:39:16.500 --> 02:39:19.000
We allocate them by county.

1653
02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:25.000
If Manchester was an at-large district, your math would possibly be correct.

1654
02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:50.500
Manchester elects to be wards when you break it down by ward you are not guaranteed a citywide divided by 34 44 number of seats thank you further discussion on the amendment on the floor which is 22 58 seeing none I'm going to ask the clerk to call the vote.

1655
02:39:50.500 --> 02:39:52.500
Representative Stephen Smith.

1656
02:39:52.500 --> 02:39:54.500
No.

1657
02:39:54.500 --> 02:39:56.500
Representative McGuire.

1658
02:39:56.500 --> 02:39:58.500
No.

1659
02:39:58.500 --> 02:40:00.500
Representative Turcotte.

1660
02:40:00.500 --> 02:40:02.500
No.

1661
02:40:02.500 --> 02:40:04.500
Representative McDonald votes no.

1662
02:40:04.500 --> 02:40:06.500
Representative Lynn.

1663
02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:08.500
No.

1664
02:40:08.500 --> 02:40:10.500
Representative Berry.

1665
02:40:10.500 --> 02:40:12.500
No.

1666
02:40:12.500 --> 02:40:14.500
Representative Alexander?

1667
02:40:14.500 --> 02:40:16.500
No.

1668
02:40:16.500 --> 02:40:18.500
Representative Marjorie Smith?

1669
02:40:18.500 --> 02:40:20.500
Yes.

1670
02:40:20.500 --> 02:40:22.500
Representative Bergeron?

1671
02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:24.500
Yes.

1672
02:40:24.500 --> 02:40:26.500
Representative Lane?

1673
02:40:26.500 --> 02:40:28.500
Yes.

1674
02:40:28.500 --> 02:40:30.500
Representative Piedra?

1675
02:40:30.500 --> 02:40:32.500
Yes.

1676
02:40:32.500 --> 02:40:34.500
Representative Weber?

1677
02:40:34.500 --> 02:40:36.500
Yes.

1678
02:40:36.500 --> 02:40:38.500
Representative Wilhelm?

1679
02:40:38.500 --> 02:40:40.500
Yes.

1680
02:40:40.500 --> 02:40:57.500
yes representative Griffin no motion fails seven to eight HB 50 as amended is remains on the floor open to further amendment is there a further amendment representative Lane yeah Merrim think, is next.

1681
02:40:57.500 --> 02:41:00.500
It's one of the single ones.

1682
02:41:00.500 --> 02:41:02.500
Sorry, I lost track.

1683
02:41:02.500 --> 02:41:04.500
Okay.

1684
02:41:04.500 --> 02:41:07.500
So, yes, I have an amendment.

1685
02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:12.500
It's a separate page, I guess, from what everybody got.

1686
02:41:12.500 --> 02:41:20.000
It's Amendment 2021-2275, and it is the same as was proposed in our working sessions.

1687
02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
So nothing has changed.

1688
02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Is there a second to Representative Lane's motion?

1689
02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
Second.

1690
02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
Representative Berzeron, thank you.

1691
02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
Go ahead, Representative Lane.

1692
02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Sorry.

1693
02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:41.500
So it is the same as what we proposed during the working sessions last week.

1694
02:41:41.500 --> 02:41:50.000
I have not had that much chance to review the one that was changed by the majority.

1695
02:41:50.000 --> 02:42:02.500
So my understanding, however, is that the minority map still has more individual towns, I think by two, than what is in the majority's map.

1696
02:42:02.500 --> 02:42:21.500
And I don't want to belabor the point, and I won't go down the path, but we feel like that is more constitutional, and because it does that and allows for more towns to have their own representatives.

1697
02:42:21.500 --> 02:42:23.500
That's the major difference.

1698
02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:40.000
I think there's two, at least as I look at it quickly, I think there are two more towns in ours that have their own reps rather than the one in the majority.

1699
02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
Okay, thank you.

1700
02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
Representative McGuire.

1701
02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1702
02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:51.000
And this map has been modified from what was presented.

1703
02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:54.000
In particular, I took Representative Lake.

1704
02:42:54.000 --> 02:43:03.000
So just for clarification of the record Representative McGuire you're talking about Merrimack is in the amendment 2274.

1705
02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:42.500
That's correct that that version of the map for for Merrimack County is different from what was presented at the public hearing and the most significant change is that I took representative Lane's redistricting for the city of Concord which added two individual wards that got their own reps their own districts and the floats are entirely within the city of Concord so there are no districts shared between Concord and the surrounding towns thank you for the clarification.

1706
02:43:42.500 --> 02:43:57.000
And I would like to mention to Representative Piedra that my this in this map my float district more than doubles in population to 27,000 people so I sympathize.

1707
02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
All right.

1708
02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.500
The amendment on the floor.

1709
02:44:01.500 --> 02:44:03.500
All right.

1710
02:44:03.500 --> 02:44:07.000
The amendment on the floor is 2275.

1711
02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:11.000
Is there any further discussion on the amendment?

1712
02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:18.000
I'm seeing none, so I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll.

1713
02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
Representative Stephen Smith.

1714
02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
No.

1715
02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
Representative McGuire.

1716
02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
No.

1717
02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
Representative Terricotte.

1718
02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
No.

1719
02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
Representative McGuire.

1720
02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
No.

1721
02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
Representative Turcotte.

1722
02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
No.

1723
02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Representative McDonald votes no.

1724
02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Representative Lynn.

1725
02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
No.

1726
02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
Representative Berry.

1727
02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
No.

1728
02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
Representative Alexander.

1729
02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
No.

1730
02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
Representative Marjorie Smith.

1731
02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Yes.

1732
02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
Representative Bergeron.

1733
02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
Yes.

1734
02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
Representative Lane.

1735
02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
Yes.

1736
02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
Representative Bergeron.

1737
02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
Yes.

1738
02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
Representative Lane.

1739
02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
Yes.

1740
02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
Representative Piedra.

1741
02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
Yes.

1742
02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
Representative Weber.

1743
02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
Yes.

1744
02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
Representative Wilhelm.

1745
02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
Yes.

1746
02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
Representative Simpson.

1747
02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
Yes.

1748
02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
Representative Griffin.

1749
02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
No.

1750
02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.500
Motion fails 7 to 8.

1751
02:45:34.500 --> 02:45:41.000
HB 50 remains on the floor, amended by 2274, open for further amendment.

1752
02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.500
Is there a further amendment?

1753
02:45:43.500 --> 02:45:45.500
Representative Simpson.

1754
02:45:45.500 --> 02:45:47.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1755
02:45:47.500 --> 02:45:51.000
I would like to propose amendment 2021-2260H.

1756
02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
Is there a second?

1757
02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
Second.

1758
02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
Representative Weber, thank you.

1759
02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:01.500
Representative Simpson, if you could speak to your motion.

1760
02:46:01.500 --> 02:46:03.500
Yes.

1761
02:46:03.500 --> 02:47:42.000
I'm proposing this amendment to the Rockingham County map, or to the amendment of the Rockingham County map, because it gives the city of Portsmouth its own representative from each ward and and keeps the city lines together while keeping the neighboring towns together as they have been in the previous 10 years the um space districts of rye and newcastle and also greenland and newington these towns have more in common with each other than they do with the city wards that they are in the in the previous amendment um we have also on this in this amendment given as many towns their own representative as possible in deer field however it was hard to work this out with the keeping the city lines together anyway so it was hard to work that out but we did hear testimony last week from folks from deer field who wanted their own district but also were asking to be with northwood in nottingham if they did have to be with other towns they felt they had more in common with those towns than with the towns of candia and auburn And so this map also does that.

1762
02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Thank you.

1763
02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
Thank you.

1764
02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:49.500
The amendment on the floor is 2275.

1765
02:47:49.500 --> 02:47:55.500
In regards to Rockingham County, is there further discussion on the amendment?

1766
02:47:55.500 --> 02:47:57.500
Representative Turcotte.

1767
02:47:57.500 --> 02:47:59.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1768
02:47:59.500 --> 02:48:04.000
Rockingham County, we have 38 districts in that county.

1769
02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:07.000
The minority map is at 32.

1770
02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
Thank you.

1771
02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:36.000
County we have 38 districts in that county the minority map is at 32 single town districts 19 we have and the minority is at 17 I sympathize with the northwest corner of your your map as you know we we came out with the same float it's pretty much inevitable up there there.

1772
02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:39.500
There's nothing we can do about it.

1773
02:48:39.500 --> 02:48:46.000
The only difference is the Deerfield, which two other towns it's attached to.

1774
02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:51.500
Our input was opposite of what we heard at the meetings.

1775
02:48:51.500 --> 02:48:57.500
As to the Newcastle and Newington issues, I grew up in Rye.

1776
02:48:57.500 --> 02:49:05.500
I spent most of my years there, although it was not Rye when I lived there.

1777
02:49:05.500 --> 02:49:09.500
I was on the other side of Rye.

1778
02:49:09.500 --> 02:49:18.000
But Rye, Northampton, and Greenland are much more in common with each other, Rye and Northampton especially.

1779
02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:32.500
Newcastle, if you go over the bridge from Newcastle over to the Portsmouth Ward that we've connected it with, you almost think you could be in the same area.

1780
02:49:32.500 --> 02:49:34.500
Same with Newington.

1781
02:49:34.500 --> 02:49:39.000
Newington, you think of the malls and everything there.

1782
02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:42.000
It's very similar to Portsmouth 1.

1783
02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:51.000
Our choice was to combine Rye and Greenland for a couple seats and then float it with Northampton.

1784
02:49:51.000 --> 02:50:00.000
Other than that, our maps aren't that different other than we have significant more districts on our map.

1785
02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1786
02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:05.500
The amendment on the floor is 2275.

1787
02:50:05.500 --> 02:50:08.500
It's in regards to Rockingham County.

1788
02:50:08.500 --> 02:50:10.500
Is there anything?

1789
02:50:10.500 --> 02:50:12.500
Oh, sorry.

1790
02:50:12.500 --> 02:50:17.500
I looked at the wrong column on my handwritten page.

1791
02:50:17.500 --> 02:50:20.000
Thank you for that correction.

1792
02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
It's 2260.

1793
02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:26.000
Is there any further discussion on the motion?

1794
02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:32.000
Seeing none, I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll.

1795
02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
Representative Stephen Smith.

1796

1828
02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
Motion fails 7-8.

1829
02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:44.000
HB 50 as amended remains on the floor.

1830
02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
Open for further amendment.

1831
02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Is there an amendment?

1832
02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
Representative Marjorie Smith.

1833
02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
Yes.

1834
02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
Representative Lane.

1835
02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
Yes.

1836
02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
Representative Lane.

1837
02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
Yes.

1838
02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
Representative Lane.

1839
02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
Yes.

1840
02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
Representative Lane.

1841
02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.500
motion fails some at 8.

1842
02:52:08.500 --> 02:52:35.500
HB 50 as amended remains on the floor open for further amendment is there an amendment representative Marjorie Smith yes thank you very much madam chair but could I ask a question of the chair first as we all know we haven't had a lot of time in preparation to review all the amendments.

1843
02:52:35.500 --> 02:52:51.000
And in looking at the amendment that the majority has submitted, and that's before us, as to Stratford County, there seem to be some differences from what we had seen earlier.

1844
02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
Are there no differences?

1845
02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
Representative Turka.

1846
02:52:55.000 --> 02:53:02.500
What you see in front of you, Representative Smith, is exactly what we initially presented.

1847
02:53:02.500 --> 02:53:06.000
Thank you for helping me understand that.

1848
02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:16.000
in that case Madam chair, I would like to move amendment 2021, two, two, four, three to house bill 50.

1849
02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.500
Representative Smith has moved 2243.

1850
02:53:18.500 --> 02:53:27.500
Is there a second representative Bergeron seconds it would you like to speak to your motion, Representative Smith?

1851
02:53:27.500 --> 02:53:29.500
Yes.

1852
02:53:29.500 --> 02:53:45.500
I'd like to speak to it very, very briefly, and I'm still a little perplexed, but I'm glad that Representative Turcotte, a fellow Stratford County representative, said that there were no changes.

1853
02:53:45.500 --> 02:54:16.000
In that case, the initial concerns we are raised with the committee continue the first is that we wanted to separate dover from summersworth and rollinsford on the same principles that we have articulated in all of the counties and that's that we thought that to the extent that it was at all possible numerically, cities should be separate from towns.

1854
02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:22.500
And sometimes that's not possible, but where it is possible, we applaud that.

1855
02:54:22.500 --> 02:54:46.500
And secondly, we wanted to keep rochester separate from other towns in any base of flutterial district third we wanted to separate Stratford from New Durham because they are connected only by the proverbial single from New Durham because they are connected only by the proverbial single point.

1856
02:54:46.500 --> 02:55:02.000
In each of these cases, we thought that our proposal more closely reached, we understood, to be the shared goals of everyone, and I would ask you to support this amendment.

1857
02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
Thank you, representative Smith.

1858
02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:12.000
Sir, anyone else who wishes to speak to the motion on the floor, 2021 22 43.

1859
02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:18.500
I really thought this meeting was gonna go go longer, so I'm looking.

1860
02:55:18.500 --> 02:55:20.500
Anybody else?

1861
02:55:20.500 --> 02:55:29.000
If nobody's going to speak, I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll on 2243.

1862
02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:32.500
This is an amendment to HB 50.

1863
02:55:32.500 --> 02:55:34.500
Representative Stephen Smith.

1864
02:55:34.500 --> 02:55:36.500
No.

1865

Representative McGuire.

1866
02:55:38.500 --> 02:55:40.500
No.

1867
02:55:40.500 --> 02:55:42.500
Representative Turcotte.

1868
02:55:42.500 --> 02:55:44.500
No.

1869
02:55:44.500 --> 02:55:46.500
Representative McDonald votes.

1870
02:55:46.500 --> 02:55:48.500

Yes.

1881
02:56:08.500 --> 02:56:10.500
Representative Representative Lane?

1882
02:56:10.500 --> 02:56:12.500
Yes.

1883
02:56:12.500 --> 02:56:14.500
Representative Piedra.

1884
02:56:14.500 --> 02:56:16.500
Yes.

1885
02:56:16.500 --> 02:56:18.500
Representative Webber.

1886
02:56:18.500 --> 02:56:20.500
Yes.

1887
02:56:20.500 --> 02:56:22.500
Representative Wilhelm.

1888
02:56:22.500 --> 02:56:24.500
Yes.

1889
02:56:24.500 --> 02:56:26.500
Representative Simpson.

1890
02:56:26.500 --> 02:56:28.500
Yes.

1891
02:56:28.500 --> 02:56:30.500
Representative Griffin.

1892
02:56:30.500 --> 02:56:32.500
No.

1893
02:56:32.500 --> 02:56:35.000
Motion fails seven to eight.

1894
02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:40.000
HB 50 remains on the floor open to further amendment.

1895
02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.500
Is there a further amendment?

1896
02:56:42.500 --> 02:56:44.500
Representative Smith.

1897
02:56:44.500 --> 02:56:46.500
Yes, Madam Chair.

1898
02:56:46.500 --> 02:56:50.500
As to Sullivan County, I propose Amendment 2021-2254.

1899
02:56:50.500 --> 02:56:56.500
And assuming there's a second, I have to wait for a second.

1900
02:56:56.500 --> 02:56:59.000
It's been moved and seconded.

1901
02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:06.500
Representative Smith, is this consistent with the presentation previously received on this county, your amendment?

1902
02:57:06.500 --> 02:57:13.000
It is consistent with what we presented when we first discussed Sullivan County.

1903
02:57:13.000 --> 02:58:13.500
Okay, let me just check something I believe you will find that the district numbers are different but that the amendment proposed by the majority includes specifically the map proposed by the minority for Sullivan County, and I'm looking at the amendment to make sure that in fact it does Representative Smith, who is much more familiar with this district, represents to me that it is the same, and it was the intent of the majority to adopt the minority map for Sullivan County I thank you very much for that clarification and I thank you even more for your willingness to consider our submission since we are probably now all in agreement I see no reason to extend the discussion.

1904
02:58:13.500 --> 02:58:15.500
And in that case.

1905
02:58:15.500 --> 02:58:28.500
Just actually, you know, before I made that comment before the second hit the floor intentionally because I believed that was what I was looking at.

1906
02:58:28.500 --> 02:58:35.000
So if that is in fact true and that's a representation being made.

1907
02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:46.000
And again, this is why I'm saying if people see things to please let me know because it should be the same.

1908
02:58:46.000 --> 02:59:05.500
I noticed I think the district numbers are going to be different, which is why I couldn't do a complete comparison because district numbers are assigned in the order that the map is created, which probably wasn't the same.

1909
02:59:05.500 --> 02:59:07.500
Thank you.

1910
02:59:07.500 --> 02:59:29.000
why I couldn't do a complete comparison because district numbers are assigned in the order that the map is created, which probably wasn't the same, but that's why the district numbers are same, but it should otherwise be the same as the proposal.

1911
02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:39.000
In that case, Madam Chair, and particularly for lacking a second, I withdraw my request for the Sullivan County amendment.

1912
02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:49.500
I'm looking at one half of the table to make sure that everybody agrees that what we've just done is correct.

1913
02:59:49.500 --> 02:59:52.500
And indeed, that is the case.

1914
02:59:52.500 --> 02:59:57.500
HB 50 is on the floor open to further amendment.

1915
02:59:57.500 --> 03:00:01.500
Are there any further amendments to HB 50.

1916
03:00:01.500 --> 03:00:08.000
The amendment on the floor is amendment 2021 22 74 any further amendments.

1917
03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:15.000
I'm not seeing any do I have a motion on HB 50 representative McGuire.

1918
03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:22.500
Thank you Madam Chair I move ought to pass with amendment on House Bill 50.

1919
03:00:22.500 --> 03:00:26.000
Is there a second to that motion.

1920
03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:28.000
Second Madam Madam Chair.

1921
03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.500
Representative Turcott has seconded it.

1922
03:00:30.500 --> 03:00:34.500
Is there any further discussion on this motion?

1923
03:00:34.500 --> 03:00:41.500
This is the motion for state representative districts, the reallocation for all 10 counties.

1924
03:00:41.500 --> 03:00:46.000
I'm seeing no hands or no indication of discussion.

1925
03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:50.500
I will ask the clerk to call the roll.

1926
03:00:50.500 --> 03:00:52.500

1957
03:01:52.500 --> 03:01:54.500
Representative Simpson.

1958
03:01:54.500 --> 03:01:56.500
No.

1959
03:01:56.500 --> 03:01:58.500
Representative Griffin.

1960
03:01:58.500 --> 03:02:00.500
Yes.

1961
03:02:00.500 --> 03:02:03.000
Motion passes 8 to 7.

1962
03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:09.500
HB 50 is being recommended out of committee as OTP with amendment 2274.

1963
03:02:09.500 --> 03:02:17.500
That is the last of the bills I have in front of this committee for .

1964
03:02:17.500 --> 03:02:49.000
OTP with amendment 2274 that is the last of the bills I have in front of this committee for executive session these bills need to need it to be reported out by Thursday of this week I will be looking for reports by the close of business tomorrow the clerk's has reconfirmed after learning our discussion, that the reports are due this week.

1965
03:02:49.000 --> 03:03:02.500
So if those can get in by the close of business tomorrow, that makes it certain that they will get to the clerk on Thursday the 18th.

1966
03:03:02.500 --> 03:03:18.000
As far as I know, the only other issue that before this committee is, of course, Representative Bergeron and Representative Lane did a lot of work on this, is the city.

1967
03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:29.500
Is the allocation by the city of population to their wards and what impact that might have on what we have voted on?

1968
03:03:29.500 --> 03:03:34.500
We have started to get in data from the cities.

1969
03:03:34.500 --> 03:03:43.000
As I stated, we're going to wait to get as much of that data in as possible.

1970
03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:58.000
We're having the Joel who is running the program for us input that data and when that's available, there'll be discussions in regards to how to proceed as a committee.

1971
03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:35.000
It is anticipated that these bills will be before the house at the sessions which I now understand are scheduled on the first Wednesday and Thursday in January which would be January 5th and 6th if my recollection is correct is there representative Smith madam chair I I just want to make sure that there's a notice that there will be a minority report on House Bill 50, and the motion would be OTPA.

1972
03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:43.500
And we will let you know the name of the member who will be writing that report.

1973
03:04:43.500 --> 03:04:45.500
Okay.

1974
03:04:45.500 --> 03:04:58.500
I just raised a question in my mind as to putting it in the calendar, all those different amendments, whether they can be consolidated or not.

1975
03:04:58.500 --> 03:05:11.500
I feel whether they can or not, or whether they will have to be drafted as a single amendment, I feel certain that we are capable.

1976
03:05:11.500 --> 03:05:30.500
whether they can or not, or whether they will have to be drafted as a single amendment, I feel certain that we are capable of drafting minority reports that will adequately raise the issues that are of concern.

1977
03:05:30.500 --> 03:05:34.500
No, no, no, I'm not worried about that.

1978
03:05:34.500 --> 03:05:39.500
I'm just thinking about the amendments are in the calendar.

1979
03:05:39.500 --> 03:05:51.500
And then at a minimum, the clerk and OLS have plenty of time to figure out how appropriately to present that to the House.

1980
03:05:51.500 --> 03:06:06.000
Because we did present amendments, and yes, it's very unusual to have a report of ought to pass as amended by amendment and then a list of seven amendments.

1981
03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:09.500
It was handled very 10 years ago.

1982
03:06:09.500 --> 03:06:21.000
And so we'll, we'll let the staff figure out how to deal with you to figure out how best to put that forward.

1983
03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:26.500
Does anybody else have anything for the committee to address today?

1984
03:06:26.500 --> 03:06:28.500
I'm seeing nothing.

1985
03:06:28.500 --> 03:06:31.000
So this meeting is adjourned.

1986
03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:35.000
I want to thank you all very much.

1987
03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:38.000
There will be no meeting tomorrow.

1988
03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:41.500
There is no need for a meeting.

1989
03:06:41.500 --> 03:06:45.000
The bills have all been voted on.

1990
03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:54.000
So, again, I want to thank every member of this committee for being a part of this committee.

1991
03:06:54.000 --> 03:07:10.000
It has been a pleasure to have some of the dialogue we've had here, and it's been a pleasure to work together to get these bills to the entire House for voting.

1992
03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:15.000
Thank you very much thank you madam chair Thank you.

1993
03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:18.000
I actually can't start the water.

1994
03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:20.000
Four, seven.

1995
03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:22.000
Four, five, and seven.

1996
03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:24.000
There we go.

1997
03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:26.000
Six, eight, nine.

1998
03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:29.000
You're like, yeah, it's rolling in.

1999
03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:33.000
That's why I think it's like your worship.

2000
03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:35.000
That's all.

2001
03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:37.000
That's all.

2002
03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:39.500
That's not the status quo.

2003
03:07:39.500 --> 03:07:41.500
Have a good Thanksgiving.

2004
03:07:41.500 --> 03:07:43.500
Thank you.

2005
03:07:43.500 --> 03:07:48.000
Have you ever tasted those turkeys, the wild turkeys?

2006
03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:53.000
I have to stop and let them cross the street.

2007
03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:55.000
Yeah.

2008
03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:57.000
They're not very good.

2009
03:07:57.000 --> 03:08:03.000
If I jumped out with a bat, I could be a lot.

2010
03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:06.000
Your family would not appreciate that.

2011
03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:12.000
I was driving on a New York thruway a couple years ago.

2012
03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:18.000
I think it was like three or four lanes in each direction.

2013
03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:25.500
And all of a sudden, this flock of turkeys decides to fly across the road.

2014
03:08:25.500 --> 03:08:36.500
And I was amazed that none of them got whacked because they're only all about five or six feet off the ground.

2015
03:08:36.500 --> 03:08:40.500
Of course, they're not so good at flying.

2016
03:08:40.500 --> 03:08:42.500
No.

2017
03:08:42.500 --> 03:08:44.500
Oh.

2018
03:08:44.500 --> 03:08:46.500
Thank you, Barbara.

2019
03:08:46.500 --> 03:08:49.500
Are we all going to share?

2020
03:08:49.500 --> 03:08:51.500
Yeah, yeah.

2021
03:08:51.500 --> 03:08:53.500
Thank you.

2022
03:08:53.500 --> 03:09:00.000
I know we are part of a process that is bigger than ourselves.

2023
03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:03.000
So I'll just let you know.

2024
03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:05.000
All right.

2025
03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:08.500
Thank you, Marjorie, for all you've done.

2026
03:09:08.500 --> 03:09:12.500
Thank you, Paul, for all that you've done.

2027
03:09:12.500 --> 03:09:15.000
You've all shared your work.

2028
03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:18.500
I don't know if you have champagne.

2029
03:09:18.500 --> 03:09:20.500
Thank you.

2030
03:09:20.500 --> 03:09:23.000
I think he was done.

2031
03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.000
Thank you.

2032
03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:27.000
.

2033
03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:29.000
Thank you.
