try to do
 
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 align:start position:0%

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
outstanding welcome
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative baxter um
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
the three bills we have outstanding and
 
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
i think a work session
 
00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
on 10 33 for the first
 
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
25 minutes or so till 9 30 then if we do
 
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
15 minutes each on
 
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
12 69
 
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.710 align:start position:0%
12 69
and

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 align:start position:0%
1368 right
 
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
and then when we get to 10 o'clock i
 
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
think we'll be able to
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
execute these three and be done our
 
00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
work for this
 
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
half of the
 
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
second year right good with that anybody
 
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
have any concerns comments questions
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
um with that i think i'll
 
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.790 align:start position:0%
um with that i think i'll
begin

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
begin
 
00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
explaining what we've done
 
00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:27.830 align:start position:0%
explaining what we've done
with

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 1033
 
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.070 align:start position:0%
house bill 1033
and

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
i think there's enough copies for
 
00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.430 align:start position:0%
i think there's enough copies for
everyone

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
that wants them either on the table or
 
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to open on 10 33
 
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
this was a bill prime sponsor was
 
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
from our very fine researcher a
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
legislative history on this
 
00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
this subject matter
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
state and local funding of
 
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
lobbying activities
 
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
was last heard in 2020
 
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
when and the
 
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.870 align:start position:0%
when and the
the

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
report out of the senate from senator
 
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.870 align:start position:0%
report out of the senate from senator
levesque

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
levesque
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
and i'll just grab one sentence out of
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
here she said while the legislation has
 
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.469 align:start position:0%
here she said while the legislation has
merit

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
merit
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
the committee agreed agreed
 
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
that there would be
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
didn't list them unfortunately
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
in 2017 there were two
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
there was also the same bill prohibiting
 
00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
recipients of county or municipal funds
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
from using such funds for lobbying
 
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
that too
 
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.629 align:start position:0%
that too
failed

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
failed
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
but again funnily enough
 
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
there was a sentence in there that said
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
although the intent of the bill is good
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
the language and lack of clarity make it
 
00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:58.550 align:start position:0%
the language and lack of clarity make it
unacceptable

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
unacceptable
 
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
um then in 2014 same thing
 
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 align:start position:0%
2012 same thing and all of them the
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
common denominator is saying
 
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
this is a good idea
 
00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:13.510 align:start position:0%
this is a good idea
so

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
some of us have taken it upon ourselves
 
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.469 align:start position:0%
some of us have taken it upon ourselves
to

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
clarify some of the language
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me from
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
calls and emails i've received there's
 
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of misinformation on this
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
and i think that is due to
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
the imprecise language
 
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.070 align:start position:0%
the imprecise language
so

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
which is why i pulled out and made
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
copies for all of you
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
section 15 1 and section 15 5.
 
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
everybody has a minute can pull those
 
00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
the calls that i'm getting
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
are saying if this bill passes
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
it's going to
 
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
shut down free speech from
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
cities towns
 
00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:10.790 align:start position:0%
cities towns
counties

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
and they won't be able to
 
00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:13.510 align:start position:0%
and they won't be able to
um

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
a track all of the information
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
for all of the the
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
bills coming
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
through the legislature and two they
 
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to come and talk to us
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
about it because they would be
 
00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:28.629 align:start position:0%
about it because they would be
prohibited

00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
and i think that comes from that first
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
line on 15 5
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
where it says except as provided in
 
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
no recipient of a grant or appropriation
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
of state funds may use the state funds
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
to lobby or attempt to influence
 
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.990 align:start position:0%
to lobby or attempt to influence
legislation

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
participate in a political activity or
 
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
contribute funds to any entity engaged
 
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
in these activities
 
00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.550 align:start position:0%
in these activities
and

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
i think it's being misinterpreted that
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
that means if an employee of a community
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
of a town of a state
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
or a county um
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
receives they are recipients of
 
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation of state funds so they
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
think that that means that they are
 
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.430 align:start position:0%
think that that means that they are
prohibited

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.870 align:start position:0%
prohibited
and

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
for that i then point you to section 15
 
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.509 align:start position:0%
for that i then point you to section 15
1

00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
and roman
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
v roman 5
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
that talks about
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
who is exempt
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
to report as a register and report as a
 
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.910 align:start position:0%
to report as a register and report as a
lobbyist

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
lobbyist
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
and in that it very clearly says that
 
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
public testimony before a legislative
 
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
committee is exempt
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
public testimony for any entity
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
subject to rsa 91 is exempt
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
all the way down through
 
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.550 align:start position:0%
all the way down through
letter

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.470 align:start position:0%
letter
h

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
h
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
are all the exemptions and that covers
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
all of those people that think
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes they would be
 
00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:06.710 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes they would be
um

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
they would be
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
stopped from from talking to us about
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that affects their county
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
their town their city their anything
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
and i maintain it does not um
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
and we've had discussions with our
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
with our house attorney to that effect
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
who's also in the room
 
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.990 align:start position:0%
who's also in the room
um

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
so i think that imprecise language was
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
what needs to be fixed
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
we have a an amendment
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
215 5
 
00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:43.910 align:start position:0%
215 5
that

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
that is one part of this issue
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
good morning representatives
 
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.710 align:start position:0%
good morning representatives
um

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.590 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
um the replacement for
 
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
or what we think for fifteen five
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
is what where's the
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
where's the amendment for that
 
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
that changes the language of 15 5 and
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
i'll give you a quick second
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
the important
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
part to read is it's saying except in
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph two no state grant or
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
appropriation of funds or funds
 
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
collected from property taxes
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
shall be used to lobby or attempt to
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
influence legislation participate in
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
political activity promote or oppose
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly any legislation
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
pending or proposed before the general
 
00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:49.750 align:start position:0%
pending or proposed before the general
court

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
paragraph two says any entity that
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
wishes to engage in any of the
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
activities prohibited in paragraph one
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
shall segregate the state funds and
 
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
funds collected from property taxes
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
in a separate account in such a manner
 
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
that such funds are physically and
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
financially separate
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
from any non-state grant and
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
appropriation or property tax funds that
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
may be used for any of these purposes
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
mere bookkeeping separation of the state
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
funds or funds
 
00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:21.670 align:start position:0%
funds or funds
funds

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
that should one should say fund or funds
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
collected from the property taxes from
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
other monies shall not be sufficient
 
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.230 align:start position:0%
other monies shall not be sufficient
so

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there's a lot of the
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
similar language
 
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
we did not change at all the exemptions
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
in 1501 so all of those exemptions still
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
and i think that needs to be
 
00:12:50.959 --> 00:12:52.949 align:start position:0%
and i think that needs to be
emphasized

00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
emphasized
 
00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:53.829 align:start position:0%
emphasized
that

00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
this is not stopping any free speech
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this is simply to say
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
state funds and and funds raised by
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
local property taxes shall not be used
 
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
for under 15
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
everybody with me so far
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
the next step to this
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
is a second amendment
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
and the reason for the second amendment
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
not exactly the reason for doing that um
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
that other amendment is that
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
in looking i i
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
in the conversations i've had
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
um and maybe some other representatives
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
can follow follow along with that or
 
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959 align:start position:0%
back me up
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
it seems that um many places aren't even
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
aware 15 5 exists
 
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
or is the current law
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
so that got us wondering whether
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
putting those prohibited activities in
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
the lobbyist section
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
means that
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
cities towns counties
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
never see this prohibited
 
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.150 align:start position:0%
never see this prohibited
action

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
so we started thinking maybe
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
the logical thing to do would be to put
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
this prohibited
 
00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:27.350 align:start position:0%
this prohibited
activity

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.470 align:start position:0%
activity
section

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
in each of the other parts of the rsas
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
one dealing with
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
schools one dealing with county one
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
dealing with municipal law
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
they see the prohibited
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
activities that
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
pertain to their
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
daily activity
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
does that make any sense or is there are
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
there any good morning
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
is there any conversation on that we are
 
00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:01.519 align:start position:0%
the idea would be instead of having it
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
in lobbyists
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
here's my quick example
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
a school board um
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
that is that is looking through their
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
section of of
 
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.870 align:start position:0%
section of of
rsas

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
rsas
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know to think to go into the
 
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
lobbyists section to see what were the
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
prohibited activities
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
that pertain to
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
them instead you we're putting that
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
prohibited activity in their own section
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
so they would see
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
because we're really prohibiting
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
lobbyist activities not
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
not prohibiting lobbyists
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
right the lobbyists aren't the ones that
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
are being prohibited here it's the
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
county it's the school it's the state
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry it's the municipalities
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
the county and the
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
school departments that are
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
being prohibited from using those funds
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
to purchase lobbying services
 
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
so that's where the two amendments are
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
floors open if anybody has conversation
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
comments concerns
 
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.749 align:start position:0%
comments concerns
um

00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
but that's that's the purpose and that's
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
i either did a spectacular job or nobody
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
are you okay with that are you okay with
 
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.670 align:start position:0%
are you okay with that are you okay with
that

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
um i i still have some concerns sure
 
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
um because i that's the purpose of the
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
work session here we've got gotta
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
out of practice yeah
 
00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.470 align:start position:0%
out of practice yeah
um

00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
i'm still feeling as though this is an
 
00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:03.269 align:start position:0%
i'm still feeling as though this is an
anti-lobbyist

00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
anti-lobbyist
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
type of bill
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
and i look at lobbyists as
 
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
professionals who try to help us
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
with more information on the work that
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
we do as opposed to
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
grabbing for
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
any position or any um
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
job that they feel they need to do to
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
be negative
 
00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
and i'm still having a hard time
 
00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:29.430 align:start position:0%
and i'm still having a hard time
accepting

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
accepting
 
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.630 align:start position:0%
accepting
that

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
a small town such as the towns i
 
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.510 align:start position:0%
a small town such as the towns i
represent

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
belonging to something like the
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
municipal association
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
can't just trust that association to as
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
part of their work
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
represent the towns and the jobs that we
 
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.190 align:start position:0%
represent the towns and the jobs that we
do

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
and what i'm still hearing from
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
selectmen and town councillors
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
only in the tenants i represent
 
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
is that they're concerned
 
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
that with all the bills that come before
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
us and i think we had testimony that
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
some 300 bills this year in one way or
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
another affect our cities and towns
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
that something may be missed that is
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
important to these communities
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
how can a small town
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
with limited resources
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
or a city that's very very busy and
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
can't keep track of everything either
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
one having their individual
 
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
circumstances but problems how can they
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
have a voice up here
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
if they don't trust a group like the
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
municipal association
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
to do that is only part of the dues that
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
we pay into them and i need to go back
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
to the people who have asked me to vote
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
no to be able to say to them well this
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
is absolutely the very best way in the
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
world to solve this help me please sure
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
hi thank you
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
i guess the problem that i had when i
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
was looking at this is that the current
 
00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.830 align:start position:0%
was looking at this is that the current
statute

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
um 15 5
 
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.669 align:start position:0%
um 15 5
already

00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:19:05.679 --> 00:19:08.070 align:start position:0%
already
prohibits

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
prohibits
 
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:09.919 align:start position:0%
recipient of grant money or
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation of state funds
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
to use them to either influence
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
legislation political activity etc so
 
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
there's already a prohibition in 15 5.
 
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
that language when i looked at this was
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
very confusing to me and i hope you can
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
the first line of that 15-5 says except
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
as provided in paragraph two no
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
recipient of a
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
grant so
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
lobbyists are not necessarily
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
recipients of grants
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
and i did not think it was a good idea
 
00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:50.549 align:start position:0%
to have
lobbyists

00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
lobbyists
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
in this language as a recipient when we
 
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.070 align:start position:0%
in this language as a recipient when we
know

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
that grants and state funds as well as
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
the recipients of that money are the
 
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
towns the counties the municipalities
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
so i did not want to necessarily say
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
that a recipient and how that is defined
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
because it is not
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
is the lobbyist because it is not the
 
00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.149 align:start position:0%
is the lobbyist because it is not the
lobbyist

00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
lobbyist
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
so that i think that there needed to be
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
some explanation in the lobbyist statute
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
they don't know
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
the lobbyists do not know
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
whether the funds they're getting are
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
funds from taxpayers
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
or from non-taxpayers
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
how do you fix that
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
you fix that by putting it in each of
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
the sections in the statute
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
for the cities the counties the towns so
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
that they know they have to separate
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
them and one thing that was done in the
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the legislation that that we're
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
is we clarified how to
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
separate the funds by putting them in a
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
separate account
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
that was never before in any of the
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
language in the statute
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
so not only are are we making it clear
 
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.750 align:start position:0%
so not only are are we making it clear
this

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
group of folks
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
are the recipients
 
00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
and they must separate funds that are
 
00:21:11.679 --> 00:21:12.870 align:start position:0%
and they must separate funds that are
taxpayer

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
and that are not in separate accounts
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
that was added to these bills
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
so when there's no targeting of
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
lobbyists but the fact that we had so
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
many questions coming from town folks
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
getting to your
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
questions specifically
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
none of this prohibits
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
the the purchasing of lobbying services
 
00:21:41.679 --> 00:21:42.549 align:start position:0%
the the purchasing of lobbying services
right

00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's strictly saying
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
you just can't use these funds to do it
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
so the second part of your question when
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
you were talking about how does a small
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
town do this
 
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.909 align:start position:0%
town do this
um

00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
from testimony we heard that the the
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
rates changed depending on the size of
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
the town right
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
um so we went and started looking at
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
where could cities and towns
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
access funds that aren't related to
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
local property taxes or state
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
and some of the examples were
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
they went from the ridiculous to the
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
sublime i mean you could talk about dog
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
licenses you could talk about
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
funds that came in from
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
recycling of
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
in my town we recycle cardboard
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
those are funds that aren't coming from
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
property taxes i think we only had to
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
have something like 500 in my town for
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
our municipal
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
um association dues
 
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.190 align:start position:0%
um association dues
so

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's this this should not be looked at
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
firms to represent them or
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
the ability to go through and have a
 
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
municipal association not to pick on
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
them but you brought it up
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
they can they can assess the bills that
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
are coming through and and
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
and it still would be possible
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
under all of this for any of the town
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
officials to contact their
 
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.710 align:start position:0%
officials to contact their
representatives

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
contact or come in themselves and
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
testify here that's not a prohibition on
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in any of the existing
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
law or anything that we're proposing
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
any of the town employees or any of the
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
representatives for that
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
you can't leave the phone on and then
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
sorry that doesn't work um anyway so
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
that that's my answer to it
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hill there's
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
really two things i want to comment on
 
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.350 align:start position:0%
really two things i want to comment on
one

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
to me this seems like a house cleaning
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
effort because section 15 5.
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
you're blowing everybody out with your
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
microphone are you saying it's too loud
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
some people like it some people don't
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
you can't please everybody coming in
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
from education saying what the heck is
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
to me it seems like the intended purpose
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
of section 15 5
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
was to make sure that taxpayer funds
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
aren't going towards lobbyist activity
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
and so this effort is to try to make
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
sure that intended purpose is actually
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
taking place and our laws reflect that
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
so that's number one that this is really
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
just cleaning up the the law that's
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
already supposed to be in place and then
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
two to the other representative's
 
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.669 align:start position:0%
two to the other representative's
question

00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is not going to get rid of the
 
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
municipal association or anything like
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
that we'll still see them here lobbying
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
us it just won't be taxpayer funds going
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
towards the municipal association and i
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
think a majority of
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
our constituents whether we're
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
republicans or democrats would be
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
horrified if they found out that there
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
are taxpayer funds going towards
 
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.470 align:start position:0%
are taxpayer funds going towards
lobbying

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
lobbying
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
some people might not but
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of folks would be and
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
that's not to say the municipal
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
association is good or bad everyone has
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
a different view
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
but it just shouldn't be taxpayer funds
 
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
that's funding lobbying that's that's it
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative
 
00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.630 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative
representative

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
just clarification on one point um
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
regardless this bill wouldn't prohibit
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
a lobbying group such as the municipal
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
association from researching bills and
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
informing towns or municipalities about
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
bills that may or you know may affect
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
them they just wouldn't be able to lobby
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
us directly on those things right so
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
they could pass that information along
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
so even if towns and municipalities
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources to track every
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
single bill that's coming through
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
uh a lobbyist association could still
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
research those bills and let them know
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
hey this is coming up and it might
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
affect your town is that correct
 
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.830 align:start position:0%
affect your town is that correct
um

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
that i mean that'd be that's a question
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
for clarification yes um go ahead
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.350 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
um

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
i don't nobody i've ever talked with is
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
horrified about lobbyists coming in for
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
cities and towns
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
the way the communities i represent are
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
looking at this
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking at it still
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
for example when we pay our dues to the
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
municipal association
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
part of the job of the municipal
 
00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.750 align:start position:0%
part of the job of the municipal
association

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
is to keep track of what's going on so
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
that they can better inform the towns
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's not a matter of
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
the towns
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
having one issue and the municipal
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
association having another issue and
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
then lobbyists come in and fight with
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
each other or whatever lobbyists do i
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
don't think they do that but anyway
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
but anyway i i believe that when a
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
community pays into their dues to the
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
municipal association that they're
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the municipal association as
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
a resource
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
for whatever they need for
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
information when it comes to legal
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
issues with employees for example
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
or when it comes to environmental issues
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
that may affect communities
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
and just part of what the a small part
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
of what the municipal association does
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
is they do have a couple of lobbyists
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
on how do how does anyone who's supposed
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
to separate it says
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
mere bookkeeping separation is not going
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
to work
 
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
how does this work i don't understand
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
how the separation does work now and
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
what we expect thank you representative
 
00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.630 align:start position:0%
what we expect thank you representative
um

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
actually it's supposed to be occurring
 
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:07.240 align:start position:0%
now right i mean from
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
1505 it's supposed to be being done now
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
my community when i when i talked to
 
00:28:14.399 --> 00:28:15.430 align:start position:0%
my community when i when i talked to
them

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
and they were one that came in and
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
testified on the original bill if you
 
00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.350 align:start position:0%
testified on the original bill if you
recall

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.470 align:start position:0%
 
my

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%

community

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
sits up my school department as well
 
00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
sets up a separate account just like
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
they do when they have trust funds or
 
00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:32.149 align:start position:0%
they do when they have trust funds or
anything

00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
they have physically
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
separated the funds not just in
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
bookkeeping but they have
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
created a new checking account or a new
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
savings at home whatever you want so
 
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's the only separation
 
00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.350 align:start position:0%
that's that's the only separation
representations

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
representations
 
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i am
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
never shy from asking a dumb question
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
although mr clerk will then say there
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
are no dumb questions i don't know
 
00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.350 align:start position:0%
are no dumb questions i don't know
um

00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
would there be any unintended
 
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.110 align:start position:0%
would there be any unintended
consequences

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
from this if it passes
 
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
that there are i don't know how else to
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
say it but
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
sort of like
 
00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:12.799 align:start position:0%
people who serve in multiple roles
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
so there were at one point state reps
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
from concord four of whom were
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
city councilors
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
a number of our state reps are also
 
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.870 align:start position:0%
a number of our state reps are also
selectmen

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
selectmen
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
and et cetera are firefighters
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
is i realize that we're talking about
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
funds from these entities
 
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
but recipients of those funds
 
00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.269 align:start position:0%
but recipients of those funds
cross-pollinate

00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
cross-pollinate
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
is there any unintended consequence to
 
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.789 align:start position:0%
is there any unintended consequence to
that

00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question do you want
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
no you're doing good okay
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
so we um
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
so what i would encourage and i gave you
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
a copy there of fifteen 15-1
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
so 15-1
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
who is exempted from registering and
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
acting as a lobbyist
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
and so all of those people we believe um
 
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
would that you just
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
highlighted you know someone that acts
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
as a selectmen or
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they they obviously don't have
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
to register as a lobbyist and so that
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
this would not apply to them
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
they would still have the ability to
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
attempt to influence legislation they
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
would have the ability to come in and
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
testify they would do everything that
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
they're currently
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
exempted from doing under 15 1. so
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
nothing changes here yep represents
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
specifically show you where it is roman
 
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
numeral five
 
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
and a go to d
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
d is communication made by public
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
official acting in the official capacity
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
so that nothing changes from what we're
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
what this bill does it's already there
 
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
for that protection
 
00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.430 align:start position:0%
for that protection
yep

00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
this is a very basic question and i
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
apologize that i wasn't able to listen
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
to the first testimony yeah was there a
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
business manager
 
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.669 align:start position:0%
business manager
um

00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
that testified about the
 
00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.789 align:start position:0%
that testified about the
accounting

00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
accounting
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
implications that
 
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:22.870 align:start position:0%
implications that
this

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
would incur
 
00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.389 align:start position:0%
would incur
so

00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
as far as additional costs for this
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
or in terms of actual redundancies of
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
what this has the potential to create
 
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
right um i think that was actually my
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
town administrator that was here
 
00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:45.029 align:start position:0%
town administrator that was here
coincidentally

00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
coincidentally
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
and i and i have i've had further
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
conversations um with the selectmen in
 
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.950 align:start position:0%
conversations um with the selectmen in
town

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
one of there's two things that i'd like
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
to point out they're already they're
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
already supposed to be doing this
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
number one
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
number two um
 
00:32:01.279 --> 00:32:02.149 align:start position:0%
number two um
well

00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
number two they weren't aware that they
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
were already supposed to be doing this
 
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.310 align:start position:0%
were already supposed to be doing this
so

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
that's what led us to the the point that
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
it's not in the right section you know
 
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
fifteen five
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
deals with lobbyists not with municipal
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
actions so that's part of the the
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
separate amendment
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
on the original bill
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
which i
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping everyone has a copy of
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
there was a fiscal note and the fiscal
 
00:32:29.039 --> 00:32:31.669 align:start position:0%
there was a fiscal note and the fiscal
note

00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
contacted two agencies to
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
to create the fiscal note one was the
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
association of counties and the other
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
was the municipal association
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the um under the
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
methodology of
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
what the costs would be or either
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease the municipal
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
association stated that there would be
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
no impact at the local level
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
so that's where that was
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
the part that i pointed out to my
 
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.789 align:start position:0%
the part that i pointed out to my
selectmen

00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
selectmen
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
i hope that does that answer what you
 
00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:06.870 align:start position:0%
i hope that does that answer what you
were

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.470 align:start position:0%
were
asking

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
asking
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
how to do it or well i asked if there
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
was actually a business manager the
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
person that does the math
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
and creates the budget for that town
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
administrator and those select
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
people so i think that would have been
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
the town administrator that you we were
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
talking about and my question is do they
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
have then that capacity what is that
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
financial impact so you answered that
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
with through the fiscal note my question
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
was was there actually someone here or
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
did we receive testimony from anybody
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
about what that means in their
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
day-to-day does their software allow
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
them to do this it's like a really basic
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
question well they it should because as
 
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
i just said they're doing that with
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
trust funds and and funds that are
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
specifically having to be separated now
 
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
so i can't imagine that there's a
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
software package that has to be changed
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
or i don't know
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah if they're dealing with
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
other with their with their other grants
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
and things and how it impacts then
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
their audit like these do have really
 
00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:10.230 align:start position:0%
their audit like these do have really
um

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
can have far-reaching accounting
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
implications and over-complicating
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
something that they should have simply
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
been able to already be doing we didn't
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
have anything what i'm trying to really
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
be aware of and
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
and not add the burden to
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
um smaller towns and
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
okay i think i i think so we think the
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
answer is that it shouldn't we have no
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
testimony that says that that's the case
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.109 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
representative

00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
this is a committee that really works
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
well together and
 
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:49.839 align:start position:0%
i know our chairman tries very hard to
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
make things right
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
there's a butt coming here now what
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
usually usually
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
so what i'm wondering mr chairman um
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
because there's a belief that these
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
amendments may make the bill better
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
is there anyone we could hear from in
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
the audience who might have seen these
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
amendments who might be able to tell us
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
that this is agreeable or not because
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about something more than
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
what we heard testimony on
 
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.670 align:start position:0%
what we heard testimony on
i

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
have no idea
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
whether there is a
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
additional information
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
that needs to come forward
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
we we truly are simply
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh changing the language of the existing
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
law to make it more
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
clear i believe
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
and we're trying we're suggesting that
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
it goes into a
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
separate each separate section of the
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
the law so that it pertains to the
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
specific groups
 
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.589 align:start position:0%
specific groups
the

00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
what was the phrase they used the
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
recipient groups
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
rather than um having it affect
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
lobbyists because
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't affect lobbyists
 
00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.589 align:start position:0%
it doesn't affect lobbyists
so

00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
follow up sure thank you very much mr
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
chairman um on our committee records do
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet who was in favor and who
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
was opposed do we have anything like
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
that available i have only from the
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
original online system
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
i don't have a blue sheet from here
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
we did have 21 supporting and 39
 
00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.829 align:start position:0%
we did have 21 supporting and 39
opposing

00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
opposing
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
from the original
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
hearing that we had on the bill
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay follow up sure thank you mr
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
chairman again um
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
i think i heard from all 31 of the
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
opposing quite frankly if you want to
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
know i believe that
 
00:36:43.839 --> 00:36:45.990 align:start position:0%
know i believe that
probably

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if there's anyone here
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
today who can
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
tell us
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
if they represent we heard some powerful
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
testimony from the association for
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
counties and the municipal association
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's a work session i i do appreciate
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
you allowing me to come up um a few of
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
the comments i'm concerned about one is
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
the idea that
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
different types of funds can just be
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
used to pay for different types of
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
services this idea that
 
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
property taxes can be segregated off
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
from other types of fees or funds that
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities receive just really
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
important for the committee to remember
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
that municipalities fund what they do
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
through property taxes there's nothing
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
shocking about them paying for various
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
services through the money they receive
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
from collecting property taxes because
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
that is how they fund their budgets and
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
that is how they fund what they do
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
i'm very concerned about the idea that
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
they can simply use revenue from other
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
types of fund transfer station to pay
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
for a certain
 
00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.390 align:start position:0%
for a certain
item

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
item
 
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
unless the statute allows for those fees
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
to be used for that particular
 
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.109 align:start position:0%
to be used for that particular
item

00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
item
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
as far as the um legislative history of
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
the bill i'll just comment that you know
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative hill you brought up the
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
legislative history of bills like this
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the years and yes there there
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
have been many bills like this
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
throughout the years
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
specifically with regard to 15-5 the
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
section that 1033 is dealing with when
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
we look back at the legislative history
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
of that bill
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
and i forget what year it was but i
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
recently read that legislative history
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
that legislation that created the
 
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
statute we're dealing with now was very
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
targeted on the executive branch and the
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
state and its purpose was very simple it
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
was to restrict entities that receive
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
state funds
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
from using state funds to then lobby the
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
state there was a clear issue that was
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
recognized there about using the funds
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
of the state to then just lobby the
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
state within
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities using
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
municipal funds to advocate or engage
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
with the state right not to lobby
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
themselves which was the scenario
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
scenario that
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
the original legislation that created
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
this statute was targeted at
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
again i appreciate the time i will not
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
hold you longer with all the bills that
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.319 --> 00:41:01.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else would
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to make a statement or
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
or pass or whatever you'd like i don't
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
know if if you receive what you are
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
but we would like to move on to the
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
yeah on second thought
 
00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.710 align:start position:0%
yeah on second thought
um

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
again i get i think what bothers me
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
about this is the fact that we take a
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
chunk of money and we give it to
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
somebody to help us
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
in whatever ways they see fit and we
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
agree with them to have help with our
 
00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.230 align:start position:0%
agree with them to have help with our
issues

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
and i have a problem with us now
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
micromanaging and saying you can do this
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
and you can't do that
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
when in fact it's all to our benefit
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
because we pay
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
to the municipal association that's
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
where i'm troubled
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
i can understand i can understand you're
 
00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.750 align:start position:0%
i can understand i can understand you're
troubling

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
troubling
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the spectrum
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
however there there are a number of
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
people and i've heard from the other 21
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
here too
 
00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.150 align:start position:0%
here too
that

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
that and this may be getting to
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative baxter's point that um
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
don't feel that the municipal
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
association reflects their views
 
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
and and so um the analogy that one
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
person brought up to me was
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
um i wouldn't be happy
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
if people were taking my tech and i'm
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing taking my tax money and
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
putting it into an account for a
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
candidate that i didn't agree with
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
any more
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
than i do in this situation so they're
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
he was actually bringing up president
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
trump saying i wouldn't be happy having
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
my tax dollars being contributed into an
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
account that would be the reelection for
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
president trump
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
and and i wouldn't and i expect on the
 
00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079 align:start position:0%
other side the same thing they were
 
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
saying they were drawing that analogy to
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
i think that happened to be the new
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire school boards association and
 
00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.270 align:start position:0%
hampshire school boards association and
saying

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.550 align:start position:0%
saying
those

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
that organization lobbies against their
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
interests in in situations as well and
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
they are not happy with their tax money
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
going to those organizations that lobby
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
against their interests with their tax
 
00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.589 align:start position:0%
against their interests with their tax
money

00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
right so that's what i think is behind
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
all of this thank you very much for that
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i do know that in the past
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
um even the communities i represent or
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
used to represent
 
00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:50.550 align:start position:0%
used to represent
um

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
have had disagreements with positions
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
the municipal association has taken sure
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
um nevertheless the word's gotten out
 
00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
there that
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
they're working with these issues and it
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
makes people stop and think and deal
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
with the issues when they can't
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
regularly come up here and testify
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
what i mean by that is that
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
small towns don't have
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
the people or the money to come up here
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
and and wait to be heard
 
00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:21.750 align:start position:0%
and and wait to be heard
and

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's why i get elected exactly exactly
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:44:27.119 --> 00:44:27.910 align:start position:0%
and um
so

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
this is where i feel i'm sort of between
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
a rock and a hard place i i hope
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
i hope that before we vote on this we
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
can take a little bit of a break
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
and thank you sure we have
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
yeah no we're fine
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry we are voting
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to when we get to 10 o'clock
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
we still have the other bills that we
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
need to so why don't we why don't we
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
drop this for now that's what i'd like
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
to do thank you very much
 
00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.109 align:start position:0%
to do thank you very much
um

00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to close the work session on
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
10 33 um
 
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.150 align:start position:0%
10 33 um
and

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
i think we're just going to jump right
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
chronologically to
 
00:45:09.839 --> 00:45:10.670 align:start position:0%
chronologically to
to

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
1269. um
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
and i think we're lucky enough to have
 
00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.829 align:start position:0%
and i think we're lucky enough to have
an

00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
amendment and uh
 
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
and the author of the amendment in the
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
audience so um representative evil could
 
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:24.870 align:start position:0%
audience so um representative evil could
you

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
come up and explain what we have in
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
front of us here and i assume what we
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
would have to do is have some committee
 
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.470 align:start position:0%
would have to do is have some committee
member

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
member
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
put on to this amendment
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
just for logistics purposes but
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
if you can explain what we have in front
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
of us and the
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
in the history of it would be great okay
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
the long history of it yeah i know
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
the wonderful world of uh study
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions um okay for
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
the record my name is karen ebel um i
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
represent new london and newbury
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
um merrimack district five
 
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
i think you know the long history of hb
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
1269 so i won't take you through that
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
all the time um all now but i have an
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
amendment here that's based in
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
almost in almost entirely on an
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative sheehan
 
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
and roulard worked before on which that
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
is yeah just let me yeah
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
for a second it's everyone who would
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
like to look at uh two two zero two two
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
zero seven eight two eight right sorry
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
for the record i am discussing that
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
amendment but i just wanna clarify that
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's based on the amendment largely that
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
um two representatives on your
 
00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.870 align:start position:0%
um two representatives on your
committee

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
were involved in so i'm just going to
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
like walk you through it i don't want to
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
belabor anything but on the other hand
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's almost simpler to do it if we just
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
walk through the amendment
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
so the first part of the amendment um
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
makes changes to the section on the
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
discovery chain uh discovery center
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
which i gather were requested by the
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
discovery uh
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
center um in their testimony that uh
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
they gave as a follow-up to this bill
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
page two and then it's line 26 this
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
looks like another clarifying change
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
that came in through dhhs so that's all
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
fine the the part that i'm really going
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
to focus on
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
is starting on page 2
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
line 33.
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
is that the definition of study
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
committee hasn't changed from the
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
the definition and and all of that
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
is is the same
 
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
what happened was uh what was removed
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
was our concept of a joint committee on
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
committees to review periodically all
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
the existing statutory commissions so
 
00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:02.559 align:start position:0%
that part has been
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
removed so you won't see that
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
so jumping down i think this is where
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
things get a little bit different
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
jumping down on page 2 to line page 3
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
line 16
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
we had used i admit it was somewhat of a
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
clunky phrase but it was trying to be a
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
descriptified study committee for a
 
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
statutory commission you've changed this
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
this changes that uh term to commission
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
instead of codified study committee but
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
otherwise this definition of commission
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
is identical to the one that we had
 
00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.910 align:start position:0%
is identical to the one that we had
before

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
then if you
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
so just talking a bit about page three
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
line 20.
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
this talks about a commission
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
requirement that all commissions from
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
here on out have to have a repeal date
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
no later than five years from their
 
00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:04.390 align:start position:0%
no later than five years from their
creation

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
the thing here is
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
there was some i think discussion about
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
whether or not this provision acted to
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
basically kill off all
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
existing statutory commissions that we
 
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
have today
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
and there was i think a little confusion
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
on that point i talked and and of course
 
00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:27.079 align:start position:0%
when i wrote it i was thinking
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
prospectively i wasn't thinking
 
00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.790 align:start position:0%
prospectively i wasn't thinking
retroactively

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
retroactively
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
i had quite a discussion with our house
 
00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.670 align:start position:0%
i had quite a discussion with our house
counsel

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
on this issue and i also talked to ols
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
and this provision doesn't act
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
retroactively because that's just not
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
the way we pass our laws so unless you
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
really unless the committee wants this
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
to act retroactively um
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
they would have to put in specific
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
information so i'm not sure what
 
00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
direction the committee wants in that
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
but i just want to assure you that the
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
way this is written now this is a
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
prospective requirement it's not
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
repealing anything
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
looking backward
 
00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.349 align:start position:0%
looking backward
um

00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
so then the next thing i wanted to point
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
out to the committee
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
is if you go to
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
line 24 page 3 this is a change to my
 
00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.670 align:start position:0%
line 24 page 3 this is a change to my
bill

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:22.630 align:start position:0%
bill
that

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
it just says
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
on line 24 the legislative members of
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
the commission shall constitute a
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
majority of the commission so that is a
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
new requirement at this point um you
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
know you can have one or two
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
members of the house or the senate on a
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
commission they don't necessarily have
 
00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.829 align:start position:0%
commission they don't necessarily have
to

00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
constitute a majority
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
this was a change that was in
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
representative sheehan and rulliard's
 
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
bill and if they want to explain more
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
about that i mean i think
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
thinking back to my time as deputy
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
speaker and the conversations that we
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
had one of the issues with commissions
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
is sort of retaining the power for the
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
legislators as opposed to all the other
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
members and so if you have a majority uh
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
requirement um
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
it does put a lot more pressure on
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
legislative membership i mean that's the
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
decision that you're making so if you
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
had a 15 person
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
commission you know you'd have to have
 
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
eight members of the legislature but i'm
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
just pointing that out that's for the
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
committee's um
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
consideration so that's new
 
00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:31.910 align:start position:0%
consideration so that's new
um

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:33.270 align:start position:0%
um
otherwise

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that there's that much
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
more new here that's different from what
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
i had i just
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
you know i have a continuing concern
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
that we in some way
 
00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
make some sort of a routine review of
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
existing statutory committees and
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
commissions so that they just don't grow
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
and like unreviewed for years and years
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
what we have here is a situation where
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
this bill if you go to page
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
3 line 33
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
it requires house and senate committees
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and update the indexes on an
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
annual basis and provide them to all the
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
standing committee chairs and so
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
i honestly think that gives ledge admin
 
00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
the opportunity and to be honest the
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility to look at that updated
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
list you'll pretty much be able to tell
 
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
from the list who's meeting and who
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
isn't and if you see people or see
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
groups that aren't really active you can
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
have them come on an ad hoc basis and
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
review with them and make a
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation on that basis and i would
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
hope ledge admin would would do that
 
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.109 align:start position:0%
hope ledge admin would would do that
okay

00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
and then the last thing um
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's in the amendment page four
 
00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.829 align:start position:0%
that's in the amendment page four
um

00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
just to take you through the history of
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
of the marine fisheries
 
00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.470 align:start position:0%
of the marine fisheries
section

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
when my when our committee on committees
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
was going through everything um we
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
worked with fish and game and one of the
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
things that we recommended that majority
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
membership on this advisory committee on
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
marine fisheries
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
be from the seacoast region as opposed
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
to requiring all of them
 
00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
the bill went to the senate the senate
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
removed that requirement and and i
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
should just say you talked about it here
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
at the house you decided to stick with
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
that recommendation in the original bill
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
it went to the senate the senate removed
 
00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:38.710 align:start position:0%
it went to the senate the senate removed
it

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
so when i reintroduced the bill i didn't
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
include it in the original hb 1269.
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
at your previous meeting which
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i was unable to attend i
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
understand that you decided you want to
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
put this requirement back in
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
and my suggestion was that we try to put
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
together some language that reflects the
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
discussions that were going on over in
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
so there were a couple of things um that
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
came out of a letter that i provided
 
00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.390 align:start position:0%
came out of a letter that i provided
to

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
i think chair hill and and
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative sheehan and rulliard
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
they were concerned that a majority of
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
the membership including the alternate
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
if we were going to go that route
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
be from the seacoast region
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
they really were concerned that there be
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
a requirement that everybody go on
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
that's on this advisory committee have
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
expertise in marine fisheries i put that
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
in here
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
my concern was they wanted everybody
 
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
from the seacoast region but seacoast
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
region isn't defined anywhere and so
 
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
what i did was i referred to a
 
00:54:50.789 --> 00:54:50.799 align:start position:0%
definition of tidewater towns which
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
appears earlier in
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
in the rsas
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm hoping
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
that this will be
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
acceptable going forward as a as a sort
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
of a compromised position on trying to
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
have the membership of the advisory
 
00:55:09.599 --> 00:55:10.710 align:start position:0%
have the membership of the advisory
committee

00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
come from that representation other than
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
just the tidewater towns great so that's
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the end of it
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
i did i talked a lot to
 
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
house counsel cnc and if there's
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
clarifications that he needs to make or
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
the house clerk or anybody else
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
go for it will you take questions i
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%

aisle who've worked so hard to bring
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
this to where it is today i'm
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
particularly interested in and page 3
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
lines 23 uh 20 rather through
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
about 24 25. um
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
i think that was critical
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
to this entire
 
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh piece of legislation and
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%

00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%

um it's the job that never ends no no it
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
just never ends we'll be glad when this
 
00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
is over i wanted to also make sure that
 
00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.190 align:start position:0%
is over i wanted to also make sure that
um

00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
the conversation um about
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
the missing section f um is that uh is
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
that something okay so the thing the
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
thing is um i don't know
 
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.190 align:start position:0%
thing is um i don't know
the

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
the missing okay the missing section app
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
um like area 50 yeah i know i mean i
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
think the thing was
 
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
i don't even know um how many of the
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
members know about the missing section f
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
if they didn't have um representative
 
00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.630 align:start position:0%
if they didn't have um representative
sheehan's

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
sheehan's
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
amendment because that's where it showed
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
up so i don't i don't know why i don't
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
know if they do i've lost okay so so
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
they're ready i know
 
00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
uh so the reason that came up again
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
page 3 line 20 to 22.
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
so the reason that that came up is that
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion about this
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
section acting retroactively to repeal
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
all statutory commissions
 
00:57:28.799 --> 00:57:29.589 align:start position:0%
all statutory commissions
and

00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
if you did that
 
00:57:32.559 --> 00:57:33.430 align:start position:0%
if you did that
that

00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
would end up
 
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
being a situation where everybody who
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to have their terms extended
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
would have to
 
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
and then what happened was there was a
 
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
discussion of the groups that really
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
should be excluded from an automatic
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
repeal if you look retroactively
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
and so um working with representative
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
umberger there was a list developed that
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
became the famous section f
 
00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:07.109 align:start position:0%
became the famous section f
that

00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
i just kept looking at it and i looked
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
at our definition of commission and so
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
you know i finally just said okay i'm
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
going back to the source i'm going back
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
to our house council jim cianci from
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
whence a lot of these provisions uh came
 
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
and i said are i'm confused on what is
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
really a commission for purposes of this
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
bill and he said well we're focusing on
 
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
things that study and what was listed in
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
the famous section f was like the joint
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
was like jalcar
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee things like that
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
none of those things are actually study
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
committees so what we did was
 
00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:49.990 align:start position:0%
committees so what we did was
we

00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
removed section f
 
00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
from uh representative sheehan's
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
amendment and what you have before you
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
is basically um
 
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
a replication of what
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
you guys had done before right but it
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
took a long time to get there
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
it did and and as it was pointed out to
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
me and i'd just like to throw this on
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
the record it it came down to
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
the definition that shows on page three
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
between lines 16 and 19 right and it
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:24.150 align:start position:0%
talked about
those

00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
those that are showing there were
 
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
established those entities that were
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
established by the general court and
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
codified in
 
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
rsas for the specific term to study for
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
for a specific term of time to study
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
and otherwise address a specific issue
 
00:59:44.549 --> 00:59:44.559 align:start position:0%
and those didn't apply to
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
section f right those those committees
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
that were listed in section f right and
 
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
i and i guess the only other point to
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
add there is if this provision is not
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
acting retroactively
 
00:59:58.870 --> 00:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
you don't have to be as concerned about
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
excluding things from the retroactive
 
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.230 align:start position:0%
excluding things from the retroactive
action

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
but that's again i'm just putting that
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
out there for the committee if you do
 
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
want retroactive action this this
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
provision doesn't do that it has to be
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
more specific right
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
i'm good anyone else have
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
further comments questions concerns
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
you're off the hook thank you very much
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
um do you can you just introduce this
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
with my name or should i ask ols to add
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
a member of your committee that this is
 
01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.789 align:start position:0%
a member of your committee that this is
fine

01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
fine
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
this is fine we're getting the thumbs up
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
from the house clerk so okay we're good
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
um but thank you for pointing that out
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
um i think that closes the conversation
 
01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:45.910 align:start position:0%
um i think that closes the conversation
on

01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
this unless anyone has anything else
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
they want to discuss on 1269
 
01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
they want to discuss on 1269
good

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
closing that
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
um now i see
 
01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.549 align:start position:0%
um now i see
um

01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
rich lambert ready to talk about an
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
amendment for
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
do we have no we don't have that
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
amendment as yet correct we do you
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
did it get past that here it is great
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
you're off the hook too
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
um it would be nice however if you could
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
take the
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
the witness stand and we can talk about
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
change in plants hold just a second um
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
so here's um this is probably
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
a little inside baseball stuff but um we
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
didn't list
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
this bill number
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
on in the calendar as part of the work
 
01:02:10.079 --> 01:02:11.829 align:start position:0%
on in the calendar as part of the work
session

01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
so it was just pointed out to me that it
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
would be inappropriate to bring up the
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
work session bring up this bill in this
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
work session but we can
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
if we go into executive session

rec uh relative to recusal by members of
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
the general court for conflicts of
 
01:19:59.679 --> 01:20:00.630 align:start position:0%
the general court for conflicts of
interest

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor had mentioned that an
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
amendment was needed
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
during testimony and that's what we're
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
here we have in front of us
 
01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.149 align:start position:0%
here we have in front of us
somewhere

01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
what was that
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
this one
 
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
it's amendment 2022 zero seven
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
nine four h
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
just to clarify um will you also make
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
announcements if you have received any
 
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
online support or opposed
 
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.270 align:start position:0%
online support or opposed
that

01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:36.229 align:start position:0%
that
you

01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
i can do that right now so
 
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
on the online
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
there were two people in support of this
 
01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
mr lambert um
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
i think you need to push the button so
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
the little red light lights up of course
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
i am
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
staffed the ethics committee as the
 
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
executive administrator and in that
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
capacity i can't advocate for
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
legislation or state any sort of
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
opinions on policy but i can try to
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
explain things objectively
 
01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.669 align:start position:0%
explain things objectively
questions

01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
i think the chairman gordon
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
representative gordon explained
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
how the bill came about and why based on
 
01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:26.870 align:start position:0%
how the bill came about and why based on
past

01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
or fairly recent complaints
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
and some advisory opinions where
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
it was felt that this whole issue needs
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
to be clarified in terms of when
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
disclosure is not enough but recusal
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
might be required
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
when a legislator has a conflict of
 
01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.070 align:start position:0%
when a legislator has a conflict of
interest

01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
and the the amendment seeks to clarify
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
some points that um aspects that needed
 
01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:50.950 align:start position:0%
some points that um aspects that needed
clarification

01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:51.750 align:start position:0%
clarification
um

01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
which is what he um and you discussed at
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:01.350 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
currently there's
 
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
two levels of conflict of interest one
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
you address by filling out the
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
declaration of intent form which is now
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
every two years it has all those
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
categories if you're you know in banking
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
or real estate or an attorney you
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
put that information on the form
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
and generally that is enough to do
 
01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
um in terms of
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
action required to be taken
 
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
um unless
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
the um conflict is more
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
is greater to you than other people in
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
that group so if there's a bill that
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
comes along that affects you as an
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
attorney more than other attorneys you
 
01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
would then have to go and file a
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
declaration of intent form and decide
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
whether to participate or not
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
this would impose another level
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
where if you have a substantially
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
greater benefit or detriment that could
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
occur from the bill you would have to
 
01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:56.709 align:start position:0%
occur from the bill you would have to
recuse

01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
and that grew out of
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
a complaint that
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
occurred a few years ago
 
01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:02.870 align:start position:0%
occurred a few years ago
and

01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
and and that's is that the sum and
 
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
substance of the changes in this
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
amendment yes
 
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to take questions
 
01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.950 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to take questions
yes

01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
does the committee have questions
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%

i believe this is not a question this is
 
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
a comment if i may mr chairman sure uh
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is it clarifies
 
01:23:43.679 --> 01:23:44.709 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is it clarifies
the

01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:44.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh guidelines under which or the law
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
actually will be under which a person
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
would recuse from a particular
 
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
bill that we're working on and one
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
example i have
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
is from
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
one of the committees i worked on we had
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
several people who owned rental
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
properties and did not disclose that to
 
01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
begin with
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
and then acted in ways in legislation
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
that benefited them when it came to
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant issues and this caused
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
some concern for several years and what
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment does if you look at line
 
01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.030 align:start position:0%
this amendment does if you look at line
13

01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
13
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh roman numeral four it
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
clarifies under um
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
when it as to when a person needs to
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
recuse if there's a conflict of interest
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
and that person is not able to be
 
01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
objective in their voting which is
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
already stated in our ethics booklets
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
that we have they must recuse
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
and right now there's a great deal of
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
concern among a number of house members
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
because they don't know when they should
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
or should not recuse
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
so this just helps to clarify that
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
situation what this does it works back
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
to back well that's
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
already in our booklet
 
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
maybe rich can you i i'm trying to grab
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
in the booklet where it says a person
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
needs to um if they benefit more than
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
someone else from
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
a particular
 
01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.590 align:start position:0%
a particular
issue

01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
say if they're a landlord and they're
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
going to benefit more than the average
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
person we're in here i think i've got it
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
under a conflict of interest procedure
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
on page 12 when a legislator becomes
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
aware that a conflict of interest exists
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
or may exist and the conditions set
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
forth in paragraph two and it goes on
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
and on and most people don't even look
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
at this booklet and i think that's part
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
of why we have a problem
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
they need to declare
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
that they have an interest in this
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
and then they have to declare whether or
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
not they intend to participate if a
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
person can't be objective then they must
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
okay yeah that's great um
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
i think it is
 
01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
good to um
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
more clearly spell out the language in
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
in uh in simpler language
 
01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
legislators are
 
01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
are uh
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
are busy with their own lives and with
 
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
this to read a booklet uh quite frankly
 
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
to see what what um
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
relates to them
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
i've always had difficulty with this and
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's why i've always for for freshman
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
members um
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's a great resource to go and and talk
 
01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
to mr lambert and ask him questions um
 
01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
in advance of of an issue um
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
i have personal knowledge of that
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
but i also have
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
in relation to the general
 
01:26:58.950 --> 01:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
bill as it as it was do you have a copy
 
01:27:01.110 --> 01:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
of the original bill i do as well as the
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
amendment yes
 
01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
on uh page well i guess it's one line
 
01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:12.870 align:start position:0%
on uh page well i guess it's one line
24.

01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
24.
 
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
there was there was a section uh
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
starting with has a special interest in
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
the official legislative activity
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
this is replete with with um
 
01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:28.470 align:start position:0%
this is replete with with um
areas

01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
of descriptive sentences special
 
01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:32.070 align:start position:0%
of descriptive sentences special
interest

01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.550 align:start position:0%
interest
and

01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
when it deals with
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
whether you have a conflict of interest
 
01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
well is that a special interest that i
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
have um
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
it's confusing as i'll get out for
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
everyone i think um it is for me anyway
 
01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
i'll say
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
but but special interest is mentioned
 
01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.910 align:start position:0%
but but special interest is mentioned
there

01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
and then on the top of page two
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
we we crossed out special
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
interest and made it financial interest
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
so conflict of interest means the
 
01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
condition in which a legislator has a
 
01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:07.430 align:start position:0%
condition in which a legislator has a
financial

01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
interest or a non-financial does that
 
01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
mean special interest doesn't exist
 
01:28:15.669 --> 01:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
anymore or does it exist still it's been
 
01:28:15.679 --> 01:28:17.590 align:start position:0%
anymore or does it exist still it's been
redefined

01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
redefined
 
01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:18.590 align:start position:0%
redefined
in

01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
2014 and 15 there was a study commission
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
on the ethics laws
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
and they made some changes and that was
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
actually so this will go back to the
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
language which existed from the
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
beginning from 1991 up to
 
01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:34.790 align:start position:0%
beginning from 1991 up to
2015

01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
2015
 
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh where there were was a financial
 
01:28:38.709 --> 01:28:38.719 align:start position:0%
interest in those days conflict of
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
interest was solely a financial interest
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
that commission wanted to talked about
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
recusal but didn't go there instead they
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
increased the level of conflict of
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
interest and what you need to do about
 
01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:51.510 align:start position:0%
interest and what you need to do about
it

01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
and they added this other category of
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
non-financial interest
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
which would be if someone's on the board
 
01:28:59.910 --> 01:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
of directors and as a fiduciary
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility to
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
their entity
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
um so that was added to it and also
 
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
there was more disclosure added
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
in 2015 um in terms of
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
making a requirement to make a verbal
 
01:29:14.239 --> 01:29:15.669 align:start position:0%
making a requirement to make a verbal
disclosure

01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
but that's when this term special
 
01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
interest was created and it probably
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
confused things further
 
01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:24.639 align:start position:0%
um then because it was special interest
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
was then a conflict of interest and
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest was a financial
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
interest or
 
01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
a non-financial special interest
 
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
personal interest so
 
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
this goes back to making a little less
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
complicated in that respect one would
 
01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.470 align:start position:0%
complicated in that respect one would
hope

01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
hope
 
01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:42.709 align:start position:0%
hope
but

01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
this is what i'm you know i i see puzzle
 
01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.470 align:start position:0%
this is what i'm you know i i see puzzle
looks

01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
looks
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
out there i see puzzle looks in here um
 
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
this is what we're
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
this is what we're dealing with
 
01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's very hard for someone
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
who's not
 
01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:00.390 align:start position:0%
who's not
conversant

01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
conversant
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
in in these areas or
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's just not on the radar of a lot of
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
people i think i've only heard
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
three times in house session this year
 
01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
where someone has recused themselves
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
from a vote well
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of averages tell you that that
 
01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
can't be right you know and that tells
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
me that there's still a problem um of
 
01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:23.669 align:start position:0%
me that there's still a problem um of
understanding

01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
the process maybe even if they
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
understand that they have a a conflict
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
they don't know what to do about it i
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
think is still the case
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
some people are nodding here i to go
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
further i
 
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
i was always under the impression um or
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
had it in my head and because i heard
 
01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:45.189 align:start position:0%
had it in my head and because i heard
from

01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
you know my as a freshman
 
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
legislator from my mentors that only if
 
01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:53.110 align:start position:0%
legislator from my mentors that only if
your

01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:54.470 align:start position:0%
your
situation

01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
is different than anyone else in that
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
same category if you're getting some
 
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
added benefit that others aren't and so
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
i see some of that language here
 
01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:05.990 align:start position:0%
i see some of that language here
on

01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
in the new language
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
starting on on line 10 of page two
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
but it talks about um
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
when it it's dealing with a business
 
01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:19.189 align:start position:0%
when it it's dealing with a business
um

01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:19.199 --> 01:31:20.390 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
under the and i don't see it when it's
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
an individual i see in the new language
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
and it talks on page on line 15 which is
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
substantially greater than the benefit
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
or detriment which would accrue to a
 
01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
business clients or organization in
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
general i don't see that phrase
 
01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:40.390 align:start position:0%
general i don't see that phrase
when

01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking specifically about you
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
know in a where it says we're a
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
legislator a household member i don't
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
see anything that says
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
that substantially greater than a
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
benefit or detriment which could accrue
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
to business
 
01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
that that confuses me that we're only
 
01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
seemingly talking about
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
the business relationship not the
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
personal relationship
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
am i wrong
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
i thought that maybe another few words
 
01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:08.719 align:start position:0%
could have been added
 
01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
i should have shared this with chairman
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
gordon but
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
if you look at
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
toward the end of that sentence which is
 
01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
a long sentence
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
it is a long sentence or it says
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
the next to last line the benefit of
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
detriment which would accrue
 
01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:23.590 align:start position:0%
detriment which would accrue
to

01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:24.950 align:start position:0%
to
businesses

01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
if you added the legislator or a
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
legislators household member
 
01:32:32.310 --> 01:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
and or or
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
or to
 
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
the businesses
 
01:32:36.149 --> 01:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
and this would be
 
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
the thing is probably what needs to be
 
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
described better as what constitutes a
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
substantially greater
 
01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:44.470 align:start position:0%
substantially greater
conflict

01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
and that could be worked out with the
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
ethics guidelines
 
01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:49.030 align:start position:0%
ethics guidelines
where

01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
sort of like where rules ministry rules
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
will be more more specific than a law
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
the guidelines are where
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest and the process of
 
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
dealing with them is defined and that
 
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
those are adopted by the committee and
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
then sent to the house and senate for
 
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
approval so you would be voting on
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
anything like that again
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
in a different form
 
01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.590 align:start position:0%
in a different form
but

01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
i think that this paragraph in fact i
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
know from speaking with
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative gordon this was intended
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
to also include the individual
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
because it starts out that way
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
it talks about benefit or detriment to
 
01:33:29.110 --> 01:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
the legislator or legislators household
 
01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:31.270 align:start position:0%
the legislator or legislators household
member

01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
member
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
so when it gets down to the last
 
01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.790 align:start position:0%
so when it gets down to the last
phrase

01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
phrase
 
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
this edition would clarify it further
 
01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:38.310 align:start position:0%
this edition would clarify it further
perhaps

01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
right because it does talk about the
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
legislator legislators household member
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
and then it says or
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
to produce a benefit or detriment
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
to business client so it doesn't seem
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know how you feel but but i feel
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
there's still work to be done but you're
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
you're on thank you mr chairman and
 
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you rich for all your work you're
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
doing on this for years
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
i have asked
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
that we condense our booklet into
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
something like what the executive branch
 
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
has it should be on a piece of paper
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
like this it should be well like a
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
little palm card thing
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
one side you can do this and the other
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
you can't do that we have not gotten to
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
that point yet i do know
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
that it is hard for people to understand
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
what we have without conferring with
 
01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:32.470 align:start position:0%
what we have without conferring with
rich

01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
rich
 
01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:33.350 align:start position:0%
rich
that

01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:35.189 --> 01:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
most people don't even open the booklet
 
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
to look at it
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
and if they do they don't understand it
 
01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:39.510 align:start position:0%
and if they do they don't understand it
because

01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
it requires cross-referencing in some
 
01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:43.750 align:start position:0%
it requires cross-referencing in some
parts

01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
parts
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
the attempt with this was to help
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
clarify one small section which is when
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
a person should recuse
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
and that's where that little thing would
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
be handy you know you can do this you
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
can do this but whoops don't and if you
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
do have to then you should go here and
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
do this and fill out this form or
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
something like that so i i understand
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
the confusion on this um i respect the
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
work that's been done i did not write
 
01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
chairman gordon did it and um he did
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
clean up the bill uh the bill was weak
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
and confusing and this does clarify i'm
 
01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:24.629 align:start position:0%
and confusing and this does clarify i'm
particularly

01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%
looking at lines 13-16
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
as to when recusal is required
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
um but i can see where some people don't
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
understand that either
 
01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:36.950 align:start position:0%
understand that either
so

01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
i do support this but i understand there
 
01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:41.679 align:start position:0%
are still questions
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
are there any further comments questions
 
01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:48.390 align:start position:0%
are there any further comments questions
concerns

01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
i'd be willing to accept emotion from
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
you if you would like to since your name
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
is on it
 
01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.350 align:start position:0%
is on it
well

01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
okay i would love to do ought to pass
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
but i think because of what i'm hearing
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
here that we ought to go into interim
 
01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
study so i move interim study mr
 
01:36:05.199 --> 01:36:06.790 align:start position:0%
study so i move interim study mr
chairman

01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
there a second
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
i'll move second sure we have a
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
motion to interim study
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:23.669 align:start position:0%
house bill
1368.

01:36:23.669 --> 01:36:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
we would have to accept
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
or reject the amendment
 
01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:30.229 align:start position:0%
or reject the amendment
before

01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
because there's no such thing really
 
01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
though as interim study as amended so
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
interim study we can certainly take this
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
up i i think this is a true
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
interim study that we're talking about
 
01:36:44.709 --> 01:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
so that we would be
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
looking it through with representative
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
gordon and others well i don't know mr
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
chairman if the committee has officially
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
accepted the amendment yet
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
and if because we can't do it on an
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
amendment right now if we set the
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
amendment aside
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
and then do the interim study and
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
include that i i think that i think the
 
01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
way to move forward that's what we'll do
 
01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:04.950 align:start position:0%
way to move forward that's what we'll do
um

01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%

people have put in a lot of work that
 
01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
most of us aren't really interested in
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
doing on this particular topic although
 
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
we're all grateful for the work that
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
they've done because i think it's an
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
important uh issue
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
just for the sake of the amount of work
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
that it takes to oversee these
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:33.990 align:start position:0%

01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
you know putting some sort of expected
 
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
repeal date on them uh so that they
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
don't just stay on the books um
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
kind of ineffectively i think is is the
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
right way to go um
 
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.400 align:start position:0%

bill is to make it all the way through
 
01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%

communication um to the respective
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
parties that are on the receiving end of
 
01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
this um what their what their role is um
 
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities or towns or school boards
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
or whatever uh don't inadvertently
 
01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
go against go against the law this will
 
01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
this will be will clearly communicate to
 
01:47:55.750 --> 01:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
them in the section of the law that they
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
pay attention to uh what the
 
01:47:59.590 --> 01:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
expectations are so that we're not
 
01:48:01.590 --> 01:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
setting people up for
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
misinform being misinformed of the
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility thank you representative
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
simon um any further comments
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
i will just say that i think
 
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
is probably the most important because
 
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
it makes
 
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
um people aware
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
of of the existing situation
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
as well as any future
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
changes to
 
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on purchasing lobbying
 
01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:32.709 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on purchasing lobbying
services

01:48:32.709 --> 01:48:32.719 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
and it makes them aware by putting it in
 
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
the section that pertains to their
 
01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:39.270 align:start position:0%
the section that pertains to their
own

01:48:39.270 --> 01:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
area of interest
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
it makes it very hard when you have to
 
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
go searching for
 
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
something within the rsas
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
and this would put it in their own
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
respective section which i think is a
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
a logical move forward
 
01:48:57.440 --> 01:48:58.790 align:start position:0%
a logical move forward
um

01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
with that i seeing no other comments i

26 bills i think um

01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
a lovely thing
 
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
