00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
where we're at with our fors committee
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
and stuff correct our report okay just
 
00:09:45.069 --> 00:09:45.079 align:start position:0%
give us an update you threw me with that
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
introduction it was very exciting so
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
with uh the subcommittee on forms we
 
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
actually had a meeting well first
 
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
actually judge Ashley came and spoke
 
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
before the entire committee and really
 
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
gave us a very informative update on
 
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
where they are with forms I think that
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
there's been a consensus that they have
 
00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
been paying attention but even before
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
that they were already aware that there
 
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
were some hiccups in the forms they went
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
from having you know each Court area
 
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
having different forms to all getting
 
00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:15.399 align:start position:0%
the same forms so now that they all have
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
the same they're they're looking at how
 
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
can they simplify that in our
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting um we met with uh a
 
00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
court uh a clerk and um what was great
 
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
about that was actually actually it was
 
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
it was unintentional unintentional but
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
representative ball was there and you
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
were there uh chairman Pearson and
 
00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:37.959 align:start position:0%
representative ball actually
 
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrated how it's actually hard to
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
find the forms on the website so they
 
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
were able to see that firsthand but they
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
do have steps going forward starting
 
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:49.720 align:start position:0%
with the fact that right now they're
 
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
getting um they're getting quotes on
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
people that can come in and kind of work
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
through the forms and stuff there also
 
00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
what's the technical term request for
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
for it's an r r anybody remember what
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
anybody RFP yes request for proposal
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
yeah request for proposal so they need
 
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
to do that they're hoping to get figure
 
00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
out which company in the next six months
 
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
and then they'll start working they are
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
going to have some feedback they have
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
been paying attention they have been
 
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
watching the feedback that we have um
 
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we talked about
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
is making it more accessible um we did
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to them a legal aid a New
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal aid they have a page
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
that's very easily traversed and so
 
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
they're also looking at that they were
 
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:37.240 align:start position:0%
going to talk to um them about who they
 
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
use to see if there's something that
 
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
they can do that would also follow that
 
00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
because it is so easy to look at so what
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
we decided after at that subcommittee
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
meeting was really just to keep
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
Communication open we'll keep those
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
lines open but I don't think there's
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
anything necessary really from us other
 
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
than if they ask for feedback and I'm
 
00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:56.959 align:start position:0%
interested to check in with them I have
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
it on my calendar to check in in a few
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
months to see how those rfps went and to
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
see where they are in that process but
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
they are hoping they have funds to do it
 
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
so they're hoping within the next year
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
or so to start having some
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
implementations you invited three people
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
to the subcommittee meeting did you I
 
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
did and I um well what kind of people
 
00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519 align:start position:0%
well from the nice people I know that
 
00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
they were from the courts and I I knew
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
that you were going to ask me first and
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
I should have had it ready but instead
 
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
we were talking so I apologize so we had
 
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
um okay so we had the Heather Culp who
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
is the Circuit Court senior
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
administrator and then we also had
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
Elaine um low who is the Conway clerk
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
oan Conway Clerk and um judge Ashley was
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
here actually the time before so we did
 
00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
not have her come back so uh both of
 
00:12:50.189 --> 00:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
those came back and um then there were
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
three of us so it was a really small
 
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
meeting it was warmer that day than the
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
time before uh but yeah that was that
 
00:12:59.310 --> 00:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
was really our work unfortunately Ely
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
and this is how it should be the
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
judicial branch had already taken the
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
the steps to go ahead and start start
 
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
fixing this issue they knew it was an
 
00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
issue they could see uh as they've been
 
00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:12.519 align:start position:0%
watching our committee meetings um the
 
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
level of the issue so they were already
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
taking those necessary steps but I do
 
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
think from Judge Ashley it was already
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
kind of in their plan it just spurred
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
them to do it a little bit quicker so I
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
think we're in a really good place with
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
that at the end of the meeting you'll
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
recall I asked the clerks would mind
 
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
terribly if we kind of insinuated oursel
 
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
into the process and you remember their
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
response they not only did they not mind
 
00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
it they said that welcome it yes they're
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
very open to communication and feedback
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
and that's that's also why right now I
 
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
think they said it would they thought it
 
00:13:47.949 --> 00:13:47.959 align:start position:0%
would take about um actually they're
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
thinking that um the overall work might
 
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
be done in six months so at that six to
 
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
N9 months so in two months is when I
 
00:13:56.829 --> 00:13:56.839 align:start position:0%
have marked on my calendar to check in
 
00:13:58.269 --> 00:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
with them and see where we are and see
 
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
if they need any feedback but they also
 
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
have uh contacts for all of us and we
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
have their contacts so that way if
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
something comes up for us we can tell
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
them but also if they have any questions
 
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
so they do know that that we've gotten a
 
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
lot of comments and stuff on the forms
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
and just um so they know that they can
 
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
contact us on that too so open
 
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
communication when we started this
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
special committee or even before we
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
first met I met with the uh Chief
 
00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
Justice of the Supreme Court and also
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
administrative judge David King and
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
suggested that
 
00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:36.759 align:start position:0%
um I want to gang up with them to fix
 
00:14:38.829 --> 00:14:38.839 align:start position:0%
problems rather than ganging up against
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
them we've seen too much of ganging up
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
against people and they said that's what
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
they would like as well somebody said
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
did I trust them I said yes until they
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
give me reason not to and they haven't
 
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
and they are listening to what we do
 
00:14:58.829 --> 00:14:58.839 align:start position:0%
whether live or you know by recording
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
and anticipating and it was to me a
 
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
tremendous thing to go in and here
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
they're already doing it even before we
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
told them to yeah would you write up
 
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:11.000 align:start position:0%

that's the um special subcommittee group
on

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
forms I'd like to call on Vice chair
 
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
Smith if you would for judicial training
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
education supervision and accountability
 
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
and RSA
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
4049 f.6 should be
 
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
reviewed good morning morning Mr chair
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
um and I um will not be as
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
um as thorough or complete as my
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
nashille colleague because I've been
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
struggling with with some of this and uh
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
and I know those on the subcommittee
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
struggling and it begins Mr chair
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
because family court cases are among the
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
most complex
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
that a circuit court judge
 
00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
faces even if a judge is familiar with
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
the law and almost no judges appointed
 
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
to the Circuit Court
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
are the application of the
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
law might very well have no bearing on
 
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
solving the painful complex
 
00:16:57.389 --> 00:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
idiosyncratic questions that brought the
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
party to the court Court in the first
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
place we um have
 
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.309 align:start position:0%
place we um have
listened

00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
listened
 
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
carefully as I think everyone has to the
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
testimony the very painful testimony
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
that has been presented to this
 
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
committee um but in addition we have
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
tried to identify sources that
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
um uh per perhaps bring some more
 
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.990 align:start position:0%
um uh per perhaps bring some more
neutral

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
perspective to the to the uh the issues
 
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly uh probably no one wants
 
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
to be in the Family Court they just
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
assume not have those problems that have
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
to be resolved but in most
 
00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
cases um they're resolved
 
00:17:59.710 --> 00:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
with people not not necessarily all
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
feeling happy um but
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh willing
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
to attempt to abide by the the judges
 
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
decisions um and those people who have
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
come before us um as important as their
 
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
experience is and I don't think any of
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
us would want to minimize that do not
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily represent the
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
mainstream of those people who go
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
through the
 
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
court but it is important to take
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
seriously what they
 
00:18:45.789 --> 00:18:45.799 align:start position:0%
say we uh looked at materials that came
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
from a lot of sources but the one that
 
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
um I know I found particularly helpful
 
00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
is the Family Justice
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
courts and their General thinking is
 
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
something that I want to share with
 
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
everybody and I hope we will share in
 
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.190 align:start position:0%
everybody and I hope we will share in

have to be applied
 
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
in order to end up with outcomes that
 
00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:06.799 align:start position:0%
might be helpful at all and then you
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
have issues like bankruptcy law
 
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
immigration which I hadn't focused on
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
but is incredibly important and criminal
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
law and so
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
um to begin with as
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
chair I question the basic premise that
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
the judicial arena is the appropriate
 
00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:36.039 align:start position:0%
place to resolve these
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
differences um who is looking at each
 
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
case to identify Child Development
 
00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
issues implicit bias and other
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
nonjudicial but extremely relevant
 
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
factors but charged with addressing the
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
obvious problems within the existing
 
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
structure there are certain threshold
 
00:20:59.950 --> 00:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
issues the need to sure that those
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
appointed to sit on Family Law Court
 
00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:05.799 align:start position:0%
matters on the Circuit Court have
 
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
relevant education and
 
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
experience and in situations where they
 
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.710 align:start position:0%
experience and in situations where they
have

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
experience there has to be an
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
performed in those
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances um once appointed
 
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
we believe strongly that the newly
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
seated judge must undergo training
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
focusing on the intricacies of the
 
00:21:37.559 --> 00:21:39.070 align:start position:0%
focusing on the intricacies of the
family

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
court in order for the judge to carry
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
out his or her judicial duties the
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court Staffing must mirror that
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
of the Supreme and Superior Courts and
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
that there must be a sufficient number
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
of Clerks to support the justices now
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
you might wonder why charged with
 
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
looking at EX at
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
education um and accountability we would
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
presume to mention the presence or
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
absence of
 
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
Clerks um we think it's
 
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
Central to how the judges are able to
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
carry out their
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
business um they have
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
to do everything that they have to do
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
sitting at the bench they have to write
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
the reports they have to process the
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
report they have to make sure that the
 
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
extraneous information and materials are
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
involved all of this makes it impossible
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
to devote the appropriate amount of time
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
to actually carrying out the direct
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
judicial duties we know that there are
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
time lags that we shouldn't have in the
 
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
system and believe that having
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
additional staff support could make that
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
important we know that in many cases the
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
decision is
 
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
written in um almost in if not
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily in shorthand but in in an
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
abbreviated manner where um they the
 
00:23:27.149 --> 00:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
judge says yeah I decided X but does not
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
have the time time to say and the reason
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
I decided X is because this was the
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
testimony this is what I found uh from
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
supporting or opposing documents um this
 
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
is why I ended up where I did it's all
 
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:47.240 align:start position:0%
well and good to make a decision but
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
unless people know why that decision is
 
00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
made it might be very hard for them to
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
accept it and so all of that could be
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
helped if there were in fact enough
 
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
staff support um
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh we then um we did look at uh Supreme
 
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.669 align:start position:0%
uh we then um we did look at uh Supreme
Court

00:24:12.669 --> 00:24:12.679 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
um uh rule five we looked at the
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
memorandum from judges Dave King and
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
Susan Ashley that was dated October
 
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
2nd and
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
um we
 
00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
on the one hand we're very pleased that
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
they recognized that we needed to
 
00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
um have an organized educational effort
 
00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.950 align:start position:0%
um have an organized educational effort
but

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
truthfully and this is my per this is
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
not anything that I I don't know if
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
anybody else agrees but personally I was
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
surprised that understanding the absence
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
of Staff the cas loads the pressure all
 
00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
the other things that need to be done
 
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:07.480 align:start position:0%
that the proposal was to create um uh
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
the I don't have the page in front of me
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because couldn't carry it
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
all today given the weather um but to
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
create something called roughly the you
 
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
know new New Hampshire judicial training
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
College um with all due
 
00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:30.200 align:start position:0%
respect we're a long way from needing a
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
training College what we need is someone
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
on the staff who has the responsibility
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
for making sure that every judge has
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
access to the
 
00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:45.559 align:start position:0%
training that is essential for them to
 
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
carry out their jobs and that they have
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
the time to take advantage of that
 
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
training not 6 months or 12 months after
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
they have started in the family family
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
courts but at the beginning and all of
 
00:26:05.789 --> 00:26:05.799 align:start position:0%
that I understand costs money and the
 
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
the money component is the
 
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
legislature but it is important for the
 
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
understand to be committed to explaining
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
to to the legislature is is the better
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
way of putting it I think that they
 
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
understand the need for training the
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
need for supervision the need for
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
accountability and that they H in fact
 
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
have a plan to do that the last thing
 
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
the legislature should be doing is doing
 
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
the judicial Branch's business and um
 
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
there's much more to be said much more
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
to be looked at I think I've probably
 
00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
talked long enough to give you a
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
feeling of um of of where we're going
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
and um I hope hope you will accept the
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
fact that our report that we will submit
 
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
to you next week will be a preliminary
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
report and um hoping that we will have
 
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to um do a lot more in terms
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
of identifying best practices across the
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
country and relating those to the
 
00:27:24.669 --> 00:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
realities of how the New Hampshire court
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
system operates and the hope that
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
we can get all of us closer to the best
 
00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:36.039 align:start position:0%
possible system thank you Mr chair and
 
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
with that I would ask anyone else who
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
served on the judicial training
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
education supervision accountability
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee if you have something to
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
add to what the subgroup chair has just
 
00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
eloquently given us this is a time to
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.519 --> 00:28:02.029 align:start position:0%
 
subcommittee

00:28:02.029 --> 00:28:02.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
hearing nothing would you type that all
 
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:07.240 align:start position:0%
up and send it out over the weekend to
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%

00:28:15.509 --> 00:28:15.519 align:start position:0%
have emailed before what I would like is

um just also list who is in
 
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080 align:start position:0%

meetings Okay I I as I say I will do the
 
00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
best that I can I'm sure you will and
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
we'll look at all of this now over the
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
weekend and come back uh as many of us
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
as can next Tuesday to make some uh
 
00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
report next subcommittee was the
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
g/ pent parenting coordinator role and
 
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
um who do I call upon for that did you
 
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
Che that didn't you I did but I wasn't
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
there but I'll you to speak on it I do
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
watch it but you tun T in yes of course
 
00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
you did yes so you were the named chair
 
00:29:05.789 --> 00:29:05.799 align:start position:0%
so if you could give us the lead off and
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
then we could call on the others who
 
00:29:11.789 --> 00:29:11.799 align:start position:0%
were there as well sure so the GP
 
00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:15.320 align:start position:0%
parting coordinator subcommittee met I
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately wasn't able to make it so
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative long was kind enough to
 
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
fill in as chair for me that day thank
 
00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
you very much rep long he wrote that to
 
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
victory in the Manchester election by
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
the way wonderful
 
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
and um uh attorney uh Erin crean from
 
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
the court attended as well and was there
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
to answer many questions as well as took
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
home quite a few questions that the
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
group had she was able to respond to um
 
00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:46.039 align:start position:0%
many of the questions I think there was
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
one outstanding question that I had in
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
my notes um and I think at this point
 
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
the group needs to come together based
 
00:29:55.149 --> 00:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
on the information that we've received
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
and see what
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
further may need to be done so my
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be that we have
 
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
another meeting to see if we have enough
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
data based on the information that we
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
got back from attorney KGAN to be able
 
00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
to make any recommendations or if we
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
feel like we need to do any more
 
00:30:15.149 --> 00:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
research but I do think that we do need
 
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
to have another meeting as a
 
00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh to go over the
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
information we've received and see a
 
00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.750 align:start position:0%
information we've received and see a
path

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
forward and in terms of the the the
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
parenting coordinator piece I did prior
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
to the filing deadline put in kind of a
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
placeholder bill so that we'd have
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
something in there it was as thorough as
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
I could be for the parenting coordinator
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
piece but the gal piece is something
 
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:43.240 align:start position:0%
that's really already in there and
 
00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:46.039 align:start position:0%
so that's much more involved so there's
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
no placeholder for that and that would
 
00:30:48.509 --> 00:30:48.519 align:start position:0%
be the place where I think we really
 
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
need to discuss and see what may need to
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
be done there if anything and what our
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations will be because the
 
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
other piece of it is a financial piece
 
00:31:02.909 --> 00:31:02.919 align:start position:0%
in that much of what we heard was that
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
Indigent parties who can't afford a g
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
are often turned away
 
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
and it's not a budget year so I'm not
 
00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.110 align:start position:0%
and it's not a budget year so I'm not
sure

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
that that's necessarily going to be
 
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
possible now but maybe that's more of a
 
00:31:18.909 --> 00:31:18.919 align:start position:0%
recommendation that we make for the next
 
00:31:20.669 --> 00:31:20.679 align:start position:0%
budget so I think we really need to come
 
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
back together and discuss all of that I
 
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
have reserved because of calendar
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
deadline issues next Tuesday November
 
00:31:32.629 --> 00:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
14th at 9:30 for the special committee
 
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
as a work session and just keep that in
 
00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:40.039 align:start position:0%
the back of your mind it might be one or
 
00:31:43.629 --> 00:31:43.639 align:start position:0%
two of the subcommittees could be
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
meeting and then all of us at say 11
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
o'clock or something if you know this is
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
just an ill formed thought trying to
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
coales uh just hold that idea or maybe
 
00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
you would want to schedule a meeting of
 
00:32:01.629 --> 00:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee for a little bit later
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
on that would come past our deadline for
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
making our interim report possibly or we
 
00:32:12.509 --> 00:32:12.519 align:start position:0%
could schedule another meeting of the
 
00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
whole subcommittee later on I mean this
 
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
is just all options we have but we would
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
like to get the interim report in uh
 
00:32:24.029 --> 00:32:24.039 align:start position:0%
this year Vice chair please um Mr chair
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
could you flesh out your idea
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
frequently interim reports are um tend
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
to be brief and tend to
 
00:32:39.629 --> 00:32:39.639 align:start position:0%
identify not so much what has happened
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
but where the you know the the body
 
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
wants to go my understanding is that we
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
have another full year we do before we
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
have a detailed final report and all of
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
that one would hope would be done and
 
00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
distributed so that information that
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
might AFF affect the next budget process
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
would already
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
be people would be aware of it but so I
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
I just want to know how much you really
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
want for this um interim report I think
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
we want something more than a sketchy
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
outline and something less than a
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
complete final report okay thank you
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
somewhere on the Continuum Mr chair
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
squaring the circle okay yes and in
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
terms of discussion not only
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
is the Judiciary paying attention and
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
walking with us and sometimes actually
 
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
leading us on um I get to meet with the
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
chairman of
 
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
Finance at least once a week we both
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
represent Kingston and East Kingston and
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
um he is uh really starting to warm up
 
00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
to the suggestion of not only in the
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
next budget do we need more judges we
 
00:33:57.629 --> 00:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
need clerks in the Circuit Court we need
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
a trainer we need supervisors uh I'm
 
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
feeding it to him in ways that uh he
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
understands how financially this is a
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
very responsible thing to do that is
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
wonderful news Mr chairman I do want to
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
point out to you that it is
 
00:34:17.599 --> 00:34:19.790 align:start position:0%
point out to you that it is
theoretically

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
theoretically
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
possible that the distinguished
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative with whom I have served
 
00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
on finance for many years might in fact
 
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
not be the chair of the finance
 
00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:36.839 align:start position:0%
committee it could be we also know that
 
00:34:40.349 --> 00:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
no matter what happens the incumbent
 
00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
Governor will not be the governor and uh
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
by this this coming spring the budget
 
00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
process itself actually begins to start
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
with each of the Departments MH having
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
to begin to get information in so that
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
it is also a very good news that you
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
give us that the judicial branch is
 
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
paying attention and one would hope
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
would make sure that some of of these
 
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
directions are reflected in the um in
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
the plan that they're probably almost
 
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
ready to begin on for the next budget
 
00:35:28.589 --> 00:35:28.599 align:start position:0%
well I'm keeping my eye on developments
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
and right now I intend to dance with the
 
00:35:34.349 --> 00:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
gal I brought to the dance and should
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
something happen along the way I am
 
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
flexible I'm delighted to hear that and
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
um I'm can't very well dance right now
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
but I would do it if I could and perhaps
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
you and I could
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
meet thank you the uh fourth of the four
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
working group groups was on the subject
 
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
of Rules of Evidence and you know as
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
you're making your um wish list for next
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
month I hardly recommend and I believe
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
representative Greg would agree with me
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
that you put on your wish list the Rules
 
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
of Evidence almost 300 Pages it doesn't
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
come stained doged and watermarked
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's because I've read it through four
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
times slowly L read the footnotes looked
 
00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
up the cross references it's a great
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
book I'm just waiting for the movie to
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
come out so here's my report as chairman
 
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
of the Rules of Evidence
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee additional members were
 
00:36:44.309 --> 00:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
Representatives ball Greg Long and
 
00:36:47.309 --> 00:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
McMahon these five are all from the
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
because that
 
00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
committee uh would later have to decide
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 47 75 establishing a right
 
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
to submit evidence in testimony and
 
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
family court proceedings and House Bill
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
499 requiring The Rules of Evidence to
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
apply in family court cases and relative
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
to the admission of certain evidence and
 
00:37:14.309 --> 00:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
family court proceedings to use their uh
 
00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
titles so the reason I picked the five
 
00:37:20.349 --> 00:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
of us from children and family law to be
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee is we would be dealing
 
00:37:26.309 --> 00:37:26.319 align:start position:0%
with it anyway and here we are now I was
 
00:37:26.319 --> 00:37:27.270 align:start position:0%
with it anyway and here we are now I was
given

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
this uh copy of Rules of Evidence it is
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
subtitled with reporter's notes as
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
updated by the New Hampshire Bar
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
Association Rules of Evidence committee
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
published in
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
2023 testimony before
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
our special
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
committee this special committee as well
 
00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
as before children and family law often
 
00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.550 align:start position:0%
as before children and family law often
centered

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
centered
 
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
around as the people giving testimony
 
00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
said how a judge refused to to accept
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
proferred pieces of evidence for from
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
one of the litigant or refused an
 
00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
objection to the acceptance of evidence
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
from the other litigant in other words
 
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
the whole question of Rules of Evidence
 
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
was a source of much
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
testimony and the two bills submitted to
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
us would put strong um restrictions
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
prohibitions mandates on the judge Judes
 
00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:30.200 align:start position:0%
they demanded one of them demand many of
 
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
them demanded judges except all evidence
 
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
proferred in in and in any form
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
unlimited as one Bill said by the
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
presiding judge magistrate or marital
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
master or by the New Hampshire Rules of
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
Evidence or the rules of the Circuit
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
Family Circuit Court Family Division in
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
other words if somebody wants a piece of
 
00:38:57.309 --> 00:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
evidence in that piece of evidence must
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
come in assertions were made that this
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
or that judge was biased in One
 
00:39:06.309 --> 00:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
Direction or another based on a
 
00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:10.839 align:start position:0%
perceived imbalance in rulings about
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
evidence always favored the woman or
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
always favored the man or would take
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
anything or would take nothing we
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
hearings several things emerged as I
 
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
read through the book Rules of Evidence
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
allows a judge to refuse a piece of
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
evidence to be
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
admitted if it does not enhance the case
 
00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:39.640 align:start position:0%
that is it does not add or detract from
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
the likely verdict now if the judge did
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
not have the power to do that the trial
 
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
could go on indefinitely people could
 
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
keep bringing in more quote evidence and
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
the judge would have his or her hands
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
bound must accept it and yet we keep
 
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
hearing from testimony the cases drag on
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
too long well folks you can't have it
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
both ways piece page 31 each single
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
piece of evidence must have a plus value
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
well according to whom one of the bills
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
said according to the person who gives
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
it well of course but who says that
 
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
person is
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
unbiased of course well should the judge
 
00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
not hold the discretionary power
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately to decide whether a piece of
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
evidence enhances the case or is simply
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
dragging it on secondly Rules of
 
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
Evidence allows the judge to refuse a
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
piece of evidence to be admitted if its
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
probative value was substantially
 
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
outweighed by the danger of unfair
 
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
Prejudice for those of you um who are
 
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
not familiar with the legal term that
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
means the value that's probative the
 
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
value of a piece of evidence to prove
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
something is much smaller than the
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
potential inappropriate harm either to
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
the case or to another person and this
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
is a case where we've heard testimony
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
too the other side dragged in a piece of
 
00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:16.839 align:start position:0%
evidence which really didn't help the
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
case but served to ridicule the opponent
 
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
and I think we've heard objections to
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
that so if the judge cannot rule the
 
00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
probative value being less than likely
 
00:41:32.589 --> 00:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
harm then we're going to see a lot more
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
of weaponization of evidence page
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
39 Rules of Evidence allows for the
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
judge to refuse evidence of other crimes
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
when prior bad acts are in some
 
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
significant way connected to material
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
events constituting the crime charged
 
00:41:52.829 --> 00:41:52.839 align:start position:0%
and not so remote in time as to
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
eliminate the Nexus what that basically
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
means means is you cannot bring in
 
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
evidence of a past crime if it's only
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
tangentially related to the uh case at
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
hand for example in a sexual matter uh
 
00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
one could not drag in all kinds of
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
things that somebody did in college if
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
it has no or minimal relevance and only
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
serves to embarrass uh that's page 65
 
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
now I could go on for a long time I was
 
00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
actually having fun doing this but I
 
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
think you get the point in each of the
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
three examples in my opinion it must be
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
up to the judge to decide whether
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
something is relevant inappropriately
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
harmful whether it's connected and so on
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
these are judgment calls and in one case
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
it the decision could go one way in
 
00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:50.119 align:start position:0%
another case it could go that way
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
because they're not always exactly
 
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
identical so no fixed law or rule can
 
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
accurately fit every case this is why on
 
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
several occasions Rules of Evidence the
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
book States clearly The Rules of
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
Evidence are not mandatory in Circuit
 
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
Court they're they give guidance but the
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
judge has to use discretion and Research
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
indicates this is how civil court Works
 
00:43:23.549 --> 00:43:23.559 align:start position:0%
in Most states and in a few where a
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
wooden literal following
 
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
of the Rules of Evidence is mandated It
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
is believed that a substantial Advantage
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
is given to the litigant who is a lawyer
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
or who has studied the law extensively
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
over against the litigant prosay who is
 
00:43:44.549 --> 00:43:44.559 align:start position:0%
neither a lawyer nor well study but
 
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
simply representing him or
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
herself uh that seems to be the answer
 
00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
um that I'm hearing as I spot checked so
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
the conclusion that um our
 
00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
subgroup which really was a subcommittee
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
of children and family law came up
 
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
with is we ultimately must not tie the
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
hands of the judges
 
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
however there does seem to be a few
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
judges where bias intentional or
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise might possibly be
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
true so if we can't tie their
 
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
hands and yet there seems to be
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
a pattern that we should not want how do
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
we Square this
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
circle during the executive session in
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
children and family law I introduced an
 
00:44:36.599 --> 00:44:37.870 align:start position:0%
children and family law I introduced an
amendment

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.390 align:start position:0%
amendment
2023-2024

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
2023-2024
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
which would replace one of the bills in
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
its entirety and the amendment reads
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
this way if the court admits evidence or
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
testimony over the objection of one of
 
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
the parties or the court chooses is not
 
00:44:59.549 --> 00:44:59.559 align:start position:0%
to admit evidence or testimony offered
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
by one of the parties the court shall
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
note in the record the reason for its
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
decision if the belief is that the
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
judges always rule in a wise fair and
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
impartial manner it should admit no
 
00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
embarrassment for the judge to say this
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
is why I Ruled because the judge
 
00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
believes him or herself to be wise fair
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
and impartial and that's why the judge
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
made the ruling to admit or exclude a
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
piece of evidence so just tell us why
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you knew why that's why you did
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
it so no penalty there to probably just
 
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
about everybody but my suggestion to the
 
00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is that they significantly
 
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
increase the review of cases
 
00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
particularly of those judges where a
 
00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
significant number of
 
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
concerns have been raised about that
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
judge's evidentiary
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
rulings such review May correctly
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
conclude that this judge was after all
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
wise fair and impartial in most if not
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
all of his or her rulings or the
 
00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:12.200 align:start position:0%
conclusion might go in another Direction
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
warranting some continuing
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
education warranting monitoring of a
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
particular judge something that by the
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
way happens now but we would suggest
 
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
should happen more and if this problem
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
persists perhaps some disciplinary
 
00:46:35.069 --> 00:46:35.079 align:start position:0%
action could be taken an escalating
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
thing where someone somehow is not
 
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
responding to the continuing education
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
to bring that judge back into some kind
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
of balance now I believe this amendment
 
00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:49.670 align:start position:0%
of balance now I believe this amendment
this

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
suggestion for monitoring would address
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
the question of alleged impropriety
 
00:46:57.549 --> 00:46:57.559 align:start position:0%
while not not hamstringing the judges
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
where they need to have discretion trust
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
but verify for the record House Bill 475
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
is amended by the amendment I just read
 
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
passed the children and family law
 
00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:12.839 align:start position:0%
committee 16 to Zer and the somewhat
 
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
parallel bill now that we've dealt with
 
00:47:20.829 --> 00:47:20.839 align:start position:0%
the issue uh was itl 16 to zero my
 
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh to all of us is that
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
we give the above a try for a year if it
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
works we squared the circle and if it
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't we can always come back and try
 
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
again so that's my report as chairing
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee on Rules of Evidence
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
and uh anyone from that subcommittee uh
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
wishes to
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
anything no whatever but I'm not
 
00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
accepting anything so anybody from the
 
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh subcommittee wish to comment uh
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative uh McMahon long Greg or
 
00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.109 align:start position:0%
representative uh McMahon long Greg or
ball

00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
ball
 
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
no I'm
 
00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah you articulated it well
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what I what I
 
00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:20.839 align:start position:0%
recalled I think we I I think all of us
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
working together came to a pretty good
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
similar place so that is that is pretty
 
00:48:29.309 --> 00:48:29.319 align:start position:0%
much my report and I will email it to
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
everybody representative uh Madam Vice
 
00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
chair thank you very much that was a
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
very thorough and impressive report and
 
00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much for it one of uh
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
thought that struck me is how closely so
 
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
much of what you discussed um
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
intersected with the concept of of
 
00:48:55.839 --> 00:48:57.870 align:start position:0%
intersected with the concept of of
training

00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
supervision etc etc and also the need
 
00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.270 align:start position:0%
supervision etc etc and also the need
for

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
clerks um in order to be able to do what
 
00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:10.789 align:start position:0%
clerks um in order to be able to do what
you

00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
specifically direct the judges to do
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
which is to record in more detail than
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
they would have the time or ability to
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
do under these
 
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances why they have made certain
 
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.390 align:start position:0%
circumstances why they have made certain
decisions

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
so that coming in in your Silo so to
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
speak and the training supervision
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
accountability Silo we end up at the
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
same place and that I think indicates
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
that we might be on the right track
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
Madame Vice chair if if I may I would
 
00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:49.559 align:start position:0%
like to take what you just said and add
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
it to my report with with a footnote of
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
course uh just to to talk about how two
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
of the subcommittees working on somewhat
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
different things have come to very
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
similar conclusions at the meeting place
 
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
so I think I'd like to do that good yes
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
representative McBeth oh so actually I
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
had a question you hadn't called for
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
that yet I think you were asking other
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
members of the committee too well okay
 
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
other members on the committee
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
representative MC
 
00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:19.559 align:start position:0%
Beth so um the bill I at the I was
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
following you and then at the end you
 
00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
got kind of fast talking I do
 
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
that um I could be a lawyer so
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
clarification so you're there's a bill
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
that the family law committee or is
 
00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
going to put forward two bills and
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to ask or require uh Family
 
00:50:38.789 --> 00:50:38.799 align:start position:0%
Court judges to within their orders
 
00:50:41.549 --> 00:50:41.559 align:start position:0%
write Regarding why they did or did not
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
accept evidence I mean generally that's
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
something that's done from the bench I
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
think in a transcript or an audio
 
00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:51.559 align:start position:0%
recording that you can get for $25 would
 
00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
provide that information but I are you
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
asking cuz you know we've seen the
 
00:50:59.549 --> 00:50:59.559 align:start position:0%
evidence that we've gotten 25 Pages 100
 
00:51:01.789 --> 00:51:01.799 align:start position:0%
pages so I'm just wanted to clarify are
 
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
you asking for a written explanation
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
about evidentiary rulings within a
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
family court proceeding House Bill 475
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
is amended and passed by CFL committee
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
16 to0 onto consent would do exactly
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
that that if a judge says no I'm not
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
allowing that piece of evidence in there
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
is a note as to why and it may be a very
 
00:51:28.109 --> 00:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
brief phrase or if yes over the
 
00:51:30.789 --> 00:51:30.799 align:start position:0%
objection of the other litigant I am
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
why um so I would ask I mean that that
 
00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
for me and I'm you know my experience is
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
only limited to mine but in a you know
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
in a family court hearing even a 30
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
minute hearing you I mean you could have
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
20 rulings on individual package of 100
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
pieces and the recording of that I mean
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
um I I think it goes back to only
 
00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
representative Smith said yeah um well
 
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
no if you're going to submit evidence um
 
00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be an objection you're
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
still going to have to whoever's trying
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
no no it's only if there's an
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
objection your bills okay yeah yeah only
 
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
if there's an
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
objection and therefore the judge has to
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
make a ruling if there's no objection
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
there it is but if there is an objection
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
there has to be a ruling we just simply
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
believe the judge knows what he or she
 
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
is doing and then not just pulling
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
rabbits out of hats and since the judge
 
00:52:37.309 --> 00:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
knows what he or she is doing give me a
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
phrase as to why um it does not enhan
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
does not Advance the case period or its
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
probative value is outweighed by harm to
 
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
down that that I think that definitely I
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
mean my experience is only my own but
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
judge I my experience is that New
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire judges and family court do
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
they don't just say no they'll say if
 
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
there's an objection lack of foundation
 
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
okay or whatever but um then it's
 
00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:11.240 align:start position:0%
written down it will be written down the
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
transcript will be well well it's not
 
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
written in the order it's it's in the
 
00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:16.839 align:start position:0%
transcript I guess that's what I'm
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
trying to okay okay I'm just that's a
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
lot of yeah the allegations were made
 
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
that judges arbitrarily do this and
 
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
numbers of people say and we were never
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
told why I'm not going to argue whether
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
that is Truth or
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
Fiction let's say for the purpose of
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
argument it's truth the judge made a
 
00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
ruling and never said why now the judge
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
will say why and if the judges almost
 
00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
always say why there will be very few
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
cases where this amendment actually
 
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
forces the judge to do something
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
else and just to clarify then uh the
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
litigant would go back and look at the
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
transcript and then if the judge didn't
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
say why that would be brought
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
forward we will I suspect leave that to
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary how they wish to do it my
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
hope would be an administrative
 
00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
clerk hearing or getting wi the judge
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
Snodgrass I hope there's no judge
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
Snodgrass in New Hampshire if there is I
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
apologize or any of us have relatives
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
named Snodgrass judge XYZ how's that um
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
the rumor on the street is XYZ always
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
favors this side well okay let's go spot
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
check or somebody on appeal and remember
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
to appeal it must be an error in law or
 
00:54:39.069 --> 00:54:39.079 align:start position:0%
procedure it isn't just I lost I hate
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
that I'm appealing you know that uh I
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
learned that uh those would be the cases
 
00:54:47.309 --> 00:54:47.319 align:start position:0%
I what I want to do is to be able to say
 
00:54:50.549 --> 00:54:50.559 align:start position:0%
to those who have come in here and said
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
a certain thing that we hear it and to
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
the degree we you know we're able to do
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
this we want to answer it I personally
 
00:55:02.109 --> 00:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
would be very surprised there would be a
 
00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:03.799 align:start position:0%
lot of cases where the judge is
 
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
Prejudice but let's find that out I'd
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
like to be proven no there isn't but if
 
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
there is we need to know that that's all
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
this is doing is I don't want to use the
 
00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
phrase Silence the Critics I want to
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
take I want to listen to what the
 
00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
critics are saying and to the degree
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
they're correct I want there to be some
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
changes and to the degree they're wrong
 
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
criticisms representative long thank you
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh and and with that also uh
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
the the CFL committee did consider the
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
added burden on the judges that how it
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
would be more complicated or give them
 
00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
more work and we came to the conclusion
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
that it you know it was just a note as
 
00:55:52.829 --> 00:55:52.839 align:start position:0%
to why or why not and it was only for
 
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
evidence that he didn't accept or one
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
litigant was able to put in evidence and
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
the other litigant was not able to
 
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
so give me a footnote as to why the
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
other litigant wasn't a you know wasn't
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
able to so it's not on every um every
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
order that you know every order with
 
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
respect to evidence that the judge makes
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's not that um the high number of pro
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
a the judge may have said I'm not
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
considering that issue so I'm not
 
00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
accepting your evidence as a pro say I
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
forget that as soon as I walk out the
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
door and I'm thinking hey how come he
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
didn't take my evidence I I didn't hear
 
00:56:34.829 --> 00:56:34.839 align:start position:0%
it uh this way here it's written
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
everybody knows and it it just makes it
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
clearer and makes it easier for the
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
prosay uh to know that they're um you
 
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
know they they're being considered and
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
they have clear reason why uh evidence
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
was taken or not taken in in their cases
 
00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
I I mean it's addressing the prosay more
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
or less and and that's uh that's what
 
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
the legislators uh hear most is from
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
prosay people that um you know feel that
 
00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
they're being biased against and you
 
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
know we we're we're looking to uh we're
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
looking to give him a clearer
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
understanding in a way it also levels
 
00:57:21.069 --> 00:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
the field because if somebody says
 
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
objection the next thing the judge will
 
00:57:25.829 --> 00:57:25.839 align:start position:0%
say is on what grounds
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't like it isn't grounds for
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
you know making an objection so one of
 
00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
the litigant say objection your honor
 
00:57:37.789 --> 00:57:37.799 align:start position:0%
the objector should give a reason and
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
when the judge makes a ruling the judge
 
00:57:41.549 --> 00:57:41.559 align:start position:0%
should have a
 
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
reason representative McBeth so I
 
00:57:45.549 --> 00:57:45.559 align:start position:0%
understand and I appreciate it I've
 
00:57:47.309 --> 00:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
approached this a little bit differently
 
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
when um allegations of wrongdoing or or
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
or inadequate explanations have been
 
00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
provided as you know uh testimony and
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
I've talked with the uh citizens that
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
have come I've asked them to show me I
 
00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
thought that you know what what the
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
proof of what they are alleging and at
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's the point where they can't
 
00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
provide it so as far as um I'm you know
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
there you children and family law has
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
done a lot The annotation of that type
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
of a decision I can't imagine how um
 
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
much how I mean I don't I have never
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
I've I don't see that on um you know US
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
Supreme court cases so I just I'm I I I
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
you know that's another book I haven't
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
read we're just dealing with but no I I
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
mean and I but um you
 
00:58:38.029 --> 00:58:38.039 align:start position:0%
know I think you'll be able to work it
 
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
out and I think you know it is important
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
to respond to the citizens and what
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
their concerns are and to try to figure
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
out to do that in a way that balances um
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know good judicial process and time
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
that we have see if a family court case
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
at least one of the parties had a lawyer
 
00:58:58.829 --> 00:58:58.839 align:start position:0%
the lawyer would speak with the client
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
ahead of time about evidence and whether
 
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
it should be offered is there's
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
foundation for offering that evidence
 
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
and if there isn't any I'm sure the
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
lawyer would say well he's going to rule
 
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
against you so don't bother but in a
 
00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
proos say well that's not my experience
 
00:59:15.789 --> 00:59:15.799 align:start position:0%
well okay and that that's why I haven't
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
gone to law school yet um I understand
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
this will come up in the first year with
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
contracts but never mind
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
um 80%
 
00:59:28.029 --> 00:59:28.039 align:start position:0%
has one or both parties prosay in Family
 
00:59:31.029 --> 00:59:31.039 align:start position:0%
Court we've been repeatedly told so they
 
00:59:33.029 --> 00:59:33.039 align:start position:0%
may not know
 
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
this that you better have a reason for
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
asking a piece of evidence to be
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
admitted and why it might be ruled
 
00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
against you but many people don't so
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
this this will level the field I think
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
anything else anyone else on Rules of
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
Evidence I will add your wonderful
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
comments about how it connects and get
 
00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
this out to you over the weekend
 
01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
now one question we've had four
 
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and the question before us
 
01:00:09.069 --> 01:00:09.079 align:start position:0%
will be does the subcommittee can need
 
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.559 --> 01:00:26.670 align:start position:0%
 
training

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.029 --> 01:00:30.039 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm not confident about an answer
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
right now on that I do know the reality
 
01:00:38.029 --> 01:00:38.039 align:start position:0%
is that all of us are
 
01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
scrambling to go down two roads right
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
now one finish all the bills that we
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
have from last session and prepare for
 
01:00:53.789 --> 01:00:53.799 align:start position:0%
the bills that are about to fall on us
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
for the next session so that I am
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
hesitant about adding anything that is
 
01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:02.910 align:start position:0%
hesitant about adding anything that is
not

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
required there where there's not a time
 
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
limit requirement right now but I
 
01:01:14.589 --> 01:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
would hope that perhaps after the first
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
year um we could get together again and
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
say okay now we've had a preliminary
 
01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
report where do we want to go from here
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
I just don't
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
think I don't think it's fair to try to
 
01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
do something right now I guess it's my
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
my response so the suggestion is let's
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
put this on the back burner and revisit
 
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
getting the band back together again
 
01:01:43.029 --> 01:01:43.039 align:start position:0%
next year that would be my suggestion
 
01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:45.799 align:start position:0%
but it's just my that's good others in
 
01:01:50.269 --> 01:01:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
think I hear
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
nodding okay good
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
done um g/p parenting coordinator
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
representative katab is speaking of a
 
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
placeholder bill on parenting
 
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
coordinator and I think I heard you say
 
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
that more Works to work needs to be done
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
on gal so you'd like your subgroup to
 
01:02:22.349 --> 01:02:22.359 align:start position:0%
continue yes please okay I don't think
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be something that's
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
urgently done because I I guess I don't
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
want to speak for the committee but I
 
01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:33.559 align:start position:0%
asking if you feel this way that this is
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
something more that we can put into the
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
final report rather than necessarily
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
proposing a bill right now causing us to
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
urgently meet do you feel that we could
 
01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
put it in the report okay so let's have
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
it in the preliminary report and maybe
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee can be back bured for
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
next year at some point and yeah I can
 
01:02:57.309 --> 01:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
put together a preliminary report based
 
01:02:58.829 --> 01:02:58.839 align:start position:0%
on the questions that were asked of
 
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
attorney krian and the data that we've
 
01:03:03.269 --> 01:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
gotten so far as well as okay you know I
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
I think uh the parenting coordinator
 
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
piece of the parenting SLG had been very
 
01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
briefly brought up I had put in again
 
01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
that placeholder bill for it and I think
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
because of that it was more focusing on
 
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
the gal piece but I think we were kind
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
of okay with what we had what had been
 
01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:23.559 align:start position:0%
put forward for parenting coordinator am
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
I okay so the parenting coordinator
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
piece is kind of in and it's the gal
 
01:03:32.589 --> 01:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
piece that'll be a report you know going
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
more details into the final report very
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
good uh the next
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
question that I had sent you several
 
01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.390 align:start position:0%
question that I had sent you several
times

01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:45.799 align:start position:0%
is we received a lot of testimony and
 
01:03:45.799 --> 01:03:46.670 align:start position:0%
is we received a lot of testimony and
the

01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
clerks put them into categories from
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
which four subcommittees were formed I
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
have down here here on a print out um a
 
01:04:01.789 --> 01:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
couple of other perhaps categories to
 
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
start a new subcommittee and I have down
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
here child
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
support and domestic violence and sense
 
01:04:11.829 --> 01:04:11.839 align:start position:0%
representative your fingerprints are on
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
both of these would you speak to them
 
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
please so the child support piece um rep
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
ball and I worked over the summer to try
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
and talk to many of the stakeholders
 
01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
about of this including the family law
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys and hearing feedback from many
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
of them we kind of put something
 
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
together and then uh Vice chair Smith
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
was kind enough to meet with um me and
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
somebody on the other side of the wall
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
to go over some of what we had come up
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
with just to get consensus because what
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
came out of it was we looked back and
 
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
there had been child support bill after
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
child support Bill year after year after
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
year that's constantly ited and so it's
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
there were reasons why in the minutes I
 
01:04:57.789 --> 01:04:57.799 align:start position:0%
went through and I read all of the
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
minutes that I that were available um
 
01:05:02.589 --> 01:05:02.599 align:start position:0%
and tried to see what are the reasons
 
01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:06.799 align:start position:0%
that it's being ited and make sure that
 
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
this bill wasn't going to be in conflict
 
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
with the reasons where it previously
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
been itl because I think much of the
 
01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard is is parents
 
01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
need help on this especially when
 
01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
there's the Shared Parenting Time and
 
01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
parties are making approximately equal
 
01:05:26.029 --> 01:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
amounts of money if parent a makes $10
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
more than parent B they're then ordered
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
to pay the full child support amount
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
which may be $1,000 a month and then the
 
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
other parent is in essence then making
 
01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
more money than this parent and it's
 
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to then afford to do
 
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
the things that they need to be able to
 
01:05:44.269 --> 01:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
do with their kids
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
so that that piece there is a bill in
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
for that and it is my hope that since
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
there was so much input on that that the
 
01:05:57.549 --> 01:05:57.559 align:start position:0%
bill will finally pass this
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
year is that a 2023 bill that was
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
retained no that's a 2024 Bill correct
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
so is it your belief
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
that that's where all the heavy lifting
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
should be done is around that particular
 
01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
bill and we will not need a special
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of us or
 
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
not I don't believe that we will I think
 
01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.870 align:start position:0%
not I don't believe that we will I think
you

01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
know I'd like to hear if anybody else
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
has any anybody else representative
 
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
long thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
I that that is as long as I Ser the
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
children and family law those two are
 
01:06:48.269 --> 01:06:48.279 align:start position:0%
the issues those are the two that clash
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
and and and you know it it's it's made
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
me my decision some times a lot of times
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
uneasy um but I go for the benefit of
 
01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:02.200 align:start position:0%
the ad um I I don't believe they need to
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
be separate
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittees um but like representative
 
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh kab katab said it's it's it's always
 
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
been the decision as to why or or not um
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
good child
 
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
support um criterias have been killed
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
um because of domestic violence uh
 
01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:30.200 align:start position:0%
getting caught up in the child
 
01:07:32.589 --> 01:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
support yeah so I I didn't actually
 
01:07:34.829 --> 01:07:34.839 align:start position:0%
speak to the domestic violence piece I
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
apologize this was just the child
 
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
support piece
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh I
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
think that is something that is like ex
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
kind of put as a criteria for like the
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
Shared Parenting Time piece why there
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
may need to be a deviation for that so I
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
think they're kind of related in some
 
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
ways but then not necessarily because
 
01:08:07.269 --> 01:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
once the parenting time is decided then
 
01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
the child support is decided afterwards
 
01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
I the DV piece I did not work on a bet
 
01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
somebody from the Judiciary Committee
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
had put in a bill
 
01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
requiring some or an are requiring
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
electronic filing uh that's the only
 
01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
work that I know that's moving forward
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
as of now regarding domestic
 
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
violence so I would be under the
 
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
assumption that the child support bill
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
in 2024 would like its
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
predecessor come to the children and
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
family law committee and probably the
 
01:08:50.349 --> 01:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
best thing to do is when that does land
 
01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
with us uh we can just set aside a a
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
good chunk of time and
 
01:08:58.590 --> 01:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
invite you know but we do not need a
 
01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
separate subcommittee of this special
 
01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
committee all the heavy work will be
 
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
done in CFL okay yeah that seems to be
 
01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.550 align:start position:0%
done in CFL okay yeah that seems to be
the

01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
consensus all right no sub now DV what
 
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
about that if you if to your knowled
 
01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
anybody's knowledge that's the only
 
01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
DV LSR that was sent in perhaps we do
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
need a working group on the subject is
 
01:09:28.829 --> 01:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
that a fair assumption what do you
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
think I mean the right number to do it
 
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
is one not two and not zero
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
um what do people think representative
 
01:09:40.829 --> 01:09:40.839 align:start position:0%
Greg is reaching for the button there
 
01:09:40.839 --> 01:09:41.709 align:start position:0%
Greg is reaching for the button there
she

01:09:41.709 --> 01:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
she
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
is thank you I'm not sure that
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
this I mean part of this and our our you
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
know looking at the family courts you
 
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
know obviously we've had some cases that
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
have had domestic violence and whatnot
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
and and we've looked at I just don't
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
know that that's the charge under here
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
once again I think that that's something
 
01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
that will come up in I mean the fact
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
that we don't have any bills really
 
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
filed with DB is is disturbing but I
 
01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
think the things that we need to look at
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
are not going to be something that we
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
would be doing on the special commission
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
I think once again that would be
 
01:10:18.189 --> 01:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
something that uh CFL would be carrying
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.750 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
are you about to the chair recognizes
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
the vice chair for about thank you yes
 
01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
but a representative Greg said exactly
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
what I was
 
01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.110 align:start position:0%
what I was
thinking

01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
um there is
 
01:10:44.189 --> 01:10:44.199 align:start position:0%
no no reason for the special
 
01:10:44.199 --> 01:10:45.830 align:start position:0%
no no reason for the special
committee

01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
to take
 
01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
over work of and
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
responsibility of St standing policy
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
committees in the
 
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
legislature and um we have in the
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
past had uh experiences not very
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
pleasant where um we recognized the
 
01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.590 align:start position:0%
pleasant where um we recognized the
cross

01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
cross
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
um uh the cross over among three
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
committees really which is the criminal
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
justice children and family law and
 
01:11:24.669 --> 01:11:24.679 align:start position:0%
Judiciary on ISS isues relating to
 
01:11:30.189 --> 01:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
domestic violence but I think in uh I
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
don't see any reason to put that
 
01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility before the the special
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee um I uh I
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
believe uh I can't speak for for my
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
colleague from wendam but I believe
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
that uh the
 
01:11:57.149 --> 01:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
experience for those of us who were on
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and not on children and family
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh to be exposed to certain of the
 
01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
um of the painful
 
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
realities uh that people are facing I
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
we've had an exposure here in this
 
01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
committee that we haven't necessarily
 
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
had in judiciary for example um but I
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
don't think in the end that it's the
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the of the special
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
committee to do that work and so that
 
01:12:34.510 --> 01:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
the work that that our colleague has
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
done to actually file some
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
lsrs I think she has done as an
 
01:12:44.189 --> 01:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
individual rather than as a
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative of um of this committee
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
working on knowledge that she gained
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
from this committee which is how we all
 
01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
gain knowledge um we certainly don't
 
01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
want I don't believe we want a new bill
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
that will come to committees in January
 
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
ball um Vice chair thank you for
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
recognizing me um I just had a
 
01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:23.870 align:start position:0%
recognizing me um I just had a
clarification

01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
question when you said those other three
 
01:13:27.229 --> 01:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
committees came together before would
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
our recommendation um be to bring those
 
01:13:33.629 --> 01:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
three committees again to look at DV as
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
in the overall as to whether it should
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
be in family court or whether it should
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
be in criminal court or where does it
 
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
fall um or just to have an open
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
discussion because we had so many people
 
01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
come and testify um so I'm just
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
wondering if that might be our
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation is that there be a
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
different committee solely to look at
 
01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
piece representative B that is a
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
fascinating question um and I think a
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
very important
 
01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.870 align:start position:0%
very important
question

01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:13.270 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
and I am either happy or unhappy to say
 
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
I don't have an answer to that question
 
01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:23.950 align:start position:0%
I don't have an answer to that question
um

01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.470 align:start position:0%
um
it

01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:31.510 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
another special Tim
 
01:14:50.189 --> 01:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
limited committee be
 
01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
formed perhaps with Representatives
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
from Criminal Justice children and
 
01:14:58.750 --> 01:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
family and
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
Judiciary um to
 
01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
decide um is there a better
 
01:15:11.229 --> 01:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
way for the legislative branch to and
 
01:15:11.239 --> 01:15:12.510 align:start position:0%
way for the legislative branch to and
therefore

01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
then the results of that would of course
 
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
affect the other branches to address the
 
01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
incredibly serious problem of domestic
 
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.110 align:start position:0%
incredibly serious problem of domestic
vience

01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
vience
 
01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.430 align:start position:0%
vience
vience

01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
and the speaker might moan and groan at
 
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
the thought of oh dear
 
01:15:37.229 --> 01:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
but there
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
might we ought to think about that that
 
01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
might end up
 
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
being a a recommendation that doesn't
 
01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
fall within any of the standing
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
committees but recognized
 
01:15:52.199 --> 01:15:53.870 align:start position:0%
committees but recognized
that

01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
all of
 
01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.390 align:start position:0%
all of
those

01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:57.400 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:16:01.149 --> 01:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
committees have have an an or in that
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
boat that's a very interesting idea what
 
01:16:07.709 --> 01:16:07.719 align:start position:0%
do others think here that in our interim
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
report of next week we have a line item
 
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
that at least suggests perhaps just that
 
01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:21.400 align:start position:0%
that perhaps a special committee on DV
 
01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
would be named out of CF Judiciary in
 
01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
Crim Justice and simply put it
 
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you Mr
 
01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
chairman Ju Just um to I I'm sensing I'm
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
feeling in
 
01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
Manchester um the lack of supervised
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
visitations um there's been arrest in a
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
library there's exchanges happening in
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
the library uh police are called in
 
01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
they're not set up for that in my my
 
01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
understanding that from the Library
 
01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:54.760 align:start position:0%
Association that it's worse in town
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
libraries because it's smaller
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester we have security uh we have a
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
detector you go through uh however in
 
01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:05.159 align:start position:0%
the smaller towns it's it's more
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
honorous to get you know a police
 
01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
officer there when you only get two in a
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
town um so I so I think that's that's
 
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
another you know that that's going to be
 
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
coming to a boil uh I think um so um I
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
think the new committee
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh would suffice that answering those
 
01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
questions we absolutely need anyone else
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
who hasn't yet spoken on the issue of
 
01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps having this as a line item
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation in our interim report
 
01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
that we'll vote on next week anyone who
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:47.790 --> 01:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
yet thank you the chair recognize his
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman so
 
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
I I did speak kind of just that I didn't
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
think it fell fell under this committee
 
01:17:56.629 --> 01:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
but um given I mean honestly it's a
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
global uh uh pandemic of domestic
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
violence but I do think that you know
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
even looking at the little kind of tip
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
of the iceberg that this particular
 
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
commission has looked at I think that it
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
would be very important to have a a
 
01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
committee like this so I'm very um
 
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
versed on what laws we have and what we
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
don't have in the state and and this is
 
01:18:22.629 --> 01:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
definitely something that would take an
 
01:18:22.639 --> 01:18:23.750 align:start position:0%
definitely something that would take an
in

01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:18:25.390 --> 01:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
committee not just a little piece of
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
this one it needs its own focus group on
 
01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
that here's what I'll do I'll write this
 
01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
up as a separate Standalone thing
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
besides what I'm writing for my
 
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and on Mon uh Tuesday when
 
01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
we look at the documents that we're all
 
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
working on over the weekend to vote on
 
01:18:46.629 --> 01:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
them uh we can again address that and
 
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
have the weekend to think it through any
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative MC Beth thank you m
 
01:18:54.669 --> 01:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
chairman so I would just comment you
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
know we had the governor's Commission on
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
domestic violence that has I mean I
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
would look at the I mean I will
 
01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
volunteer to look at what their
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations are as far as moving
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
forward into the legislature but I think
 
01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
that that really should be our spring
 
01:19:08.350 --> 01:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
board that work has already been done by
 
01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of stakeholders and it was a
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of time uh with um I
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
mean every everybody involved so I think
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
that might be the best place to look as
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
far as if this committee is going to
 
01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation I mean to join and
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
be informed thank you yes um
 
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
frequently we
 
01:19:33.149 --> 01:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
forget in policy committees that um the
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
stake has already been cut and seasoned
 
01:19:36.990 --> 01:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
and we don't have to start from square
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
one we can start from Square Four uh we
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
forget that too often so thank you for
 
01:19:43.629 --> 01:19:43.639 align:start position:0%
the reminder representative uh the vice
 
01:19:47.310 --> 01:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
chair well well thank you I I think I
 
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative mcbeth's
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
comments and of course she's absolutely
 
01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
right in acknowledging the fact that
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
there are all kinds of groups out there
 
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
addressing um this issue some with more
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
success um than others some with more um
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
solid research than others uh some with
 
01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
different perspectives and what has been
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
missing I think is a
 
01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:21.750 align:start position:0%
missing I think is a
consistent

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.830 align:start position:0%
consistent
legislative

01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
approach and um just as in this
 
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
committee we listened to of course to
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
the courts and to um uh the G group and
 
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
we listened to when we had former
 
01:20:43.629 --> 01:20:43.639 align:start position:0%
Senator and and judge and representative
 
01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
and chair dead Gordon here with all of
 
01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
the um all the hats he wears I mean we
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
benefited a lot from knowing what other
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
groups have done and some of which we
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
agree with in the end some of which we
 
01:21:02.189 --> 01:21:02.199 align:start position:0%
didn't agree with in the end but the the
 
01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
basic point is is a solid point
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
I and the other other
 
01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
important reality is for reasons that we
 
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
might surmise but we do not
 
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
know domestic violence and related to it
 
01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.830 align:start position:0%
know domestic violence and related to it
child

01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:21:30.669 --> 01:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
abuse um is
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
um appears to be reaching
 
01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:37.830 align:start position:0%
um appears to be reaching
pandemic

01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
um level status level and
 
01:21:45.629 --> 01:21:45.639 align:start position:0%
um I don't think anyone at this table
 
01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
can feel comfortable unless we try to do
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
something it might we might not be able
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
to but at at least we should
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
try representative
 
01:21:59.669 --> 01:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
katab so I absolutely agree with putting
 
01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
this together and it was actually I have
 
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
the report right here from the
 
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
governor's task force it was actually a
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation the recommendation was a
 
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholder group with expertise in the
 
01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
area of domestic violence should review
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
existing New Hampshire statutes
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
regarding domestic violence and
 
01:22:15.629 --> 01:22:15.639 align:start position:0%
determine whether any of the areas of
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
review set forth above should be
 
01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
Advanced through the legislative process
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
so they did make quite a few
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations in here and they did
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
they did actually recommend a group
 
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
getting together and going through that
 
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
so I would absolutely support that
 
01:22:32.110 --> 01:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
somebody suggested this be a these are
 
01:22:35.629 --> 01:22:35.639 align:start position:0%
my words limited time that it is not
 
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
something that goes out a long period
 
01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
because a lot of the work has been done
 
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
and what you just read makes that even
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
more clear but a group of
 
01:22:49.709 --> 01:22:49.719 align:start position:0%
legislators reviewing all of this
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
answering what is said here coming
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
together to say okay let's put together
 
01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
an LSR that we can all live with out of
 
01:23:01.709 --> 01:23:01.719 align:start position:0%
all of this work that's being done would
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
probably be a limited time but I'll
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
leave that to other people if I could Mr
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
chair it's not necessarily an
 
01:23:13.229 --> 01:23:13.239 align:start position:0%
LSR um we're not going to uh between now
 
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
and say June um uh submit an LSR because
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
we can't right and we shouldn't and and
 
01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh but but that is not to say that we
 
01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:30.870 align:start position:0%
uh uh but but that is not to say that we
shouldn't

01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh do this having nothing to do with the
 
01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
family court in terms of the process
 
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
right now um and have it ready so that
 
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
those of us who H will have the um the
 
01:23:49.629 --> 01:23:49.639 align:start position:0%
privilege of returning to the house
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
might very well be in a position to file
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
LSR s and those of us who aren't might
 
01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
be in a position to help advise those
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
about who who are here about how to
 
01:24:02.229 --> 01:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
continue but so it's the purpose isn't
 
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
for an LSR the purpose is to say what
 
01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
should be done by
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
someone so it would give recommendations
 
01:24:12.189 --> 01:24:12.199 align:start position:0%
and then an ad hoc group of prime
 
01:24:14.669 --> 01:24:14.679 align:start position:0%
sponsor co-sponsors would wonderfully
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
say thank you very much I'll just put my
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
name on what you said could be or tweak
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
it because we have to you know could be
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay good thank you
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
all right I will um I'll have a little
 
01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
one page that we can vote on
 
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
representative long yeah than you just a
 
01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
quick uh that report date the date on
 
01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:38.709 align:start position:0%
quick uh that report date the date on
that

01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
2022 thank you and the title is the
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
report of the governor's Commission on
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
DV I have it somewhere so actually so
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
this one was a task force on domestic
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
violence cases in the New Hampshire
 
01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and I have there's a
 
01:25:02.910 --> 01:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
couple different reports that I have
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
here um yeah so that was what what came
 
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
out of that one so my one pager could
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
just simply say um and such a group
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
drawn from these three policy committees
 
01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
will review various reports from
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
commissions and judicial branch and you
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
course so there are no new subcommittees
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
so far there's a one-pager on a
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation for a committee to be
 
01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:46.719 align:start position:0%
formed uh we've got medical training
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
going to continue on the back burner
 
01:25:52.270 --> 01:25:52.280 align:start position:0%
we've got gal parenting uh to continue
 
01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
especially with reference to G that's on
 
01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
the back burner do we see any new
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that need to be formed out
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:09.629 --> 01:26:09.639 align:start position:0%
don't that looks like a
 
01:26:13.229 --> 01:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
resounding no but representative Kap so
 
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need any more work
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
groups but I do think that we did
 
01:26:17.709 --> 01:26:17.719 align:start position:0%
include some other topics which is on
 
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
the last page of what you have just
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
regarding things that should be in the
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
final report okay and and I think we
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
should definitely make sure that those
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
items are addressed in the report I
 
01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if they need to be addressed
 
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
in the interim but I do think some of
 
01:26:35.709 --> 01:26:35.719 align:start position:0%
them are are important pieces I know
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
particularly one of the pieces the
 
01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
principle of one judge one family and
 
01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
and the concept of how that can be
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
honored with the difficulties that the
 
01:26:47.229 --> 01:26:47.239 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is currently facing and I know
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
that previously uh Vice chair Smith had
 
01:26:53.550 --> 01:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
agreed to put put put that together to
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
take the lead on that one I think
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
there's a few other topics here I know
 
01:26:59.950 --> 01:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
obviously the forms ended up getting its
 
01:27:04.229 --> 01:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
own and I think the visitation piece
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
might actually be able to be covered a
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
little bit in the the DV piece because
 
01:27:09.790 --> 01:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
the visitation piece was more along the
 
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
lines of what he was saying where
 
01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
there's difficulties with exchanges and
 
01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
whatnot now especially where there's no
 
01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
there's only the one supervised
 
01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:20.350 align:start position:0%
there's only the one supervised
visitation

01:27:20.350 --> 01:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
visitation
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
center um
 
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
so I think I guess those pieces so those
 
01:27:28.830 --> 01:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
are two things in the interim report I
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
can note that over the next year heading
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
towards the final report we may be
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
addressing issues such as one judge one
 
01:27:39.149 --> 01:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
family how about
 
01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
visitation apart from domestic violence
 
01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
issues would that be sufficient to look
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
at so my hope thank you for the question
 
01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
my hope is
 
01:27:57.070 --> 01:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
that perhaps some of that can be
 
01:27:59.550 --> 01:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
addressed through the g/p parenting
 
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
coordinator because I do think it's very
 
01:28:03.629 --> 01:28:03.639 align:start position:0%
difficult a lot of times for the court
 
01:28:03.639 --> 01:28:04.550 align:start position:0%
difficult a lot of times for the court
to

01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
decipher who may be an appropriate
 
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
person for somebody that that perhaps
 
01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
does need supervis visitation we have a
 
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
big substance
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
abuse epidemic in our in our state and I
 
01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
think it could be difficult for the
 
01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
judge to know when you've got you know
 
01:28:21.669 --> 01:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
one parent that doesn't have a drug
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
issue with the other parent does and the
 
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
parent that's fit and doesn't have the
 
01:28:27.790 --> 01:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
drug issue is saying no no no to
 
01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:29.560 align:start position:0%
everybody that the other parent is
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
coming up with as a possible person it's
 
01:28:32.830 --> 01:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
difficult for the judge to kind of weigh
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
and say well are all these people really
 
01:28:38.669 --> 01:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
having problems or is there a is there
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
just being unnecessary push back here so
 
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of times they don't know
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
from the bench how could you make that
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
decision you need somebody else boots on
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
the ground to actually meet with that
 
01:28:50.109 --> 01:28:50.119 align:start position:0%
person not as much not as much of a
 
01:28:54.189 --> 01:28:54.199 align:start position:0%
level as DCF does but I mean when
 
01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
somebody's going into into foster care
 
01:28:57.790 --> 01:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
or whatnot you send somebody out see is
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
the house clean is it appropriate and
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
they even go and they do like mini
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
checks kind of on the grandparents where
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
the where the children may go so I think
 
01:29:08.030 --> 01:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
again not not to a huge extended level
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
like that but just in a go in and see is
 
01:29:11.229 --> 01:29:11.239 align:start position:0%
a home clean does this person seem
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable responsible uh without issue
 
01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
to kind of give the judge that feedback
 
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
I think that would help
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
to very much so with the problem because
 
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
I think we don't have the centers and
 
01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that the state would be
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
able to come up with the centers I think
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's more of a what else can we do since
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't really have that as an
 
01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
option anymore I'd like to flag that as
 
01:29:37.629 --> 01:29:37.639 align:start position:0%
an item that may be uh addressed in the
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
final report tucked under the ongoing
 
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
gal parenting uh continuation of that
 
01:29:47.629 --> 01:29:47.639 align:start position:0%
subg I want to flag it I I just feel
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
that needs to be mentioned somewhere in
 
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
the interim report even though it's
 
01:29:53.950 --> 01:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
tucked up under one of the subcommittees
 
01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
anything else yes represent agree with
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
you for yes you're welcome go ahead
 
01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:03.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um and also it's um it's not
 
01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
it's uh addictions and also child abuse
 
01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
not I mean DV is part of it but it's the
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
child abuse or child neglect so um I
 
01:30:13.229 --> 01:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
think that the our subcommittee would be
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
good I did miss the um October 17th
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
meeting but I I think that's a good
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
place for us to look at that thank you
 
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else no going no other
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittees nobody wants a
 
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
vacation got
 
01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
it bounding no sir we do not um okay I
 
01:30:45.149 --> 01:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
think we've got enough for the four subc
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
commmittee chairs to make a report and
 
01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
please get it to everybody by the end of
 
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
the weekend so we can digest it on
 
01:30:57.229 --> 01:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
Monday and Tuesday I know at least one
 
01:31:00.030 --> 01:31:00.040 align:start position:0%

have made some suggested changes that
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
would still give you the whatever time
 
01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
you need to just assemble the pieces

we're not doing anything you're calling
the

01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:31.709 --> 01:35:31.719 align:start position:0%
clerk yeah hi uh representative Pearson
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
in the middle of a meeting meing a
 
01:35:45.070 --> 01:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
please now we're we're trying to we're
 
01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
trying to make a a policy decision about
 
01:35:54.189 --> 01:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
whether whether an interim report can be
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
approved by email if we actually have to
 
01:35:58.990 --> 01:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
convene to vote because we're having
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
trouble getting a quorum on dates we're
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
looking at I don't think the the uh the
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
the statement coming out of the
 
01:36:10.350 --> 01:36:10.360 align:start position:0%
speaker's office constituting this
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
special committee mandated a report but
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to have an interim report
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
and the question is do we all have to be
 
01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
present in the same room to vote that
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
report or once it's
 
01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
ready um ask people by email for their

you okay um roughly I don't mean to push
 
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
but we're about done our business and
 
01:36:44.910 --> 01:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
going our separate ways how long might
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
you calendar's already
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
out does anybody have a statement that
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
constituted The
 
01:37:10.109 --> 01:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
Establishment speak office I don't have
 
01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.199 --> 01:37:57.990 align:start position:0%
 
me

01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:01.629 --> 01:38:01.639 align:start position:0%
I I um have courtesy of Representative
 
01:38:05.149 --> 01:38:05.159 align:start position:0%
long the initial uh memorandum that
 
01:38:07.589 --> 01:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
establishes this committee it does not
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
say anything that I can see about a
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
final report where it goes or anything
 
01:38:17.229 --> 01:38:17.239 align:start position:0%

adjourn until the new year my question
 
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
is do we have to approve that report in
 
01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
person with a quorum or may that interim
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
report simply be approved by the members
 
01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:50.119 --> 01:39:17.229 align:start position:0%
 
email

01:39:17.229 --> 01:39:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
the committee is the special committee
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%

01:39:45.790 --> 01:39:45.800 align:start position:0%

uh we would like to
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
cancel our Tuesday meeting we had sent
 
01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
in a request to have put into the next
 
01:40:18.350 --> 01:40:18.360 align:start position:0%

01:40:20.470 --> 01:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
committee for Tuesday November 14th at
 
01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:21.470 align:start position:0%
committee for Tuesday November 14th at
9:30

01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
9:30
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
and the committee would like to cancel
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
that I as the chair would like to cancel
 
01:40:28.589 --> 01:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
that meeting so unless the calendar is
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
already finished the calar was sent out
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
yesterday Yer it came out yesterday yeah
 
01:40:36.910 --> 01:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
yeah the veterans we did it day
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
early that would also need to be done
 
01:40:41.470 --> 01:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
through the committe services okay that
 
01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
will have to go through house committee
 
01:40:46.510 --> 01:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
that I'm
 
01:40:59.229 --> 01:40:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:01.070 --> 01:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
like somebody just this morning already
 
01:41:03.189 --> 01:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
added an addendum there's already a but
 
01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
that was that's
 
01:41:09.149 --> 01:41:09.159 align:start position:0%
a an appendix for a hearing to
 
01:41:12.270 --> 01:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
beum it would go in the addendum anyway
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.840 --> 01:42:31.109 align:start position:0%
 
would

01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
the question is how can we
 
01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
vote because all the dates we're trying
 
01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
to do Tuesday will not have a quorum so
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
we can meet on Tuesday November 14th but
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
since the purpose was to vote we will
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
lack a quorum we could not get a quorum
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
for Thursday November 16th either so the
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
question is since a report is not
 
01:42:55.470 --> 01:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
mandated in the memorandum that sets us
 
01:42:58.629 --> 01:42:58.639 align:start position:0%
up is it necessary to meet in person to
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
approve our interim report or may we do
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
it by
 
01:43:05.070 --> 01:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
email and I'd like to speak to the clerk
 
01:43:14.510 --> 01:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.679 --> 01:43:44.830 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:48.910 --> 01:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
hi Mark hi Paul the um memorandum that
 
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
sets up the special committee on Family
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
Court does not mandate a report but we
 
01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
would like to give an interim report to
 
01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
the speaker however we can't find a date
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
to meet to do it so once the report is
 
01:44:05.470 --> 01:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
finalized I would like to uh PLL the
 
01:44:07.709 --> 01:44:07.719 align:start position:0%
committee by email to have them sign off
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
on it since it's not a mandated thing um
 
01:44:14.189 --> 01:44:14.199 align:start position:0%
I would hope that we would not have to
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
try to find you can't if you're going to
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
adopt something on behalf of the
 
01:44:20.350 --> 01:44:20.360 align:start position:0%
committee the committee has to vote to
 
01:44:24.189 --> 01:44:24.199 align:start position:0%
do I agree um so I but I mean it doesn't
 
01:44:26.229 --> 01:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
have to be before next Friday so I mean
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
you can do it anytime if you want to do
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
it in December you can it's just a
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
matter of finding a time that's GNA be
