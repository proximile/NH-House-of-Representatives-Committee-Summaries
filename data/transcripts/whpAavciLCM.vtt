District 13 which is most of nashwa and
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
I'm stepping in for Senator Sherman to
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill 149 this is a bill
 
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
with three distinct Parts part one uh
 
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
for which I am the prime sponsor
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
clarifies that Behavioral Health
 
00:07:58.639 --> 00:07:59.950 align:start position:0%
clarifies that Behavioral Health
Services

00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
count towards medical expenses incurred
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
by individuals who are part of the
 
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid spend down program it does not
 
00:08:13.149 --> 00:08:13.159 align:start position:0%
expand the Medicaid benefit in any way
 
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
just makes it clear in statute that
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Care is health care for
 
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
this program and therefore since it's
 
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
just clarifying but not expanding there
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
is not uh any expected cost to for this
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
bill to the Medicaid Program however
 
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
it's necessary due to some ongoing
 
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
confusion at some of the district
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
offices and the bill also requires
 
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
reporting to the HHS oversight committee
 
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
this year and next to ensure
 
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
accountability for fairly and uniformly
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
applying the benefit as required by law
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
the language of this bill was introduced
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
in the house last year and it passed and
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
came over to the Senate unfortunately it
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
got table due to the pandemic and didn't
 
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
move forward at the time but it is still
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
necessary part two of this bill is prime
 
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
sponsored by Senator Sharon Carson from
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
district 14 it makes some technical
 
00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
changes to RSA 318 which is the pharmacy
 
00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:31.079 align:start position:0%
statute and it just enhances Pharmacy
 
00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
services in certain facilities through
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
the use of automated Pharmacy systems
 
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
part three sponsored by Senator gray of
 
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
district 6 provides some liability
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
protections so licensed Health
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
Facilities that were deemed to have been
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
complying with emergency orders state
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
and federal during the current Corona
 
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:01.720 align:start position:0%
virus Co 19 pandemic I believe the
 
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
department is here to answer
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%

00:10:53.629 --> 00:10:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
about any other comments or questions
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
for Senator rosenwall think I see
 
00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:01.150 align:start position:0%
for Senator rosenwall think I see
representative

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:01.160 align:start position:0%

00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%

clarify I do not think this is the um
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
same issue that representative snow has
 
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
been talking about this just clarifies
 
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
that mental health benefits should be
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
counted towards the spend down um
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative snow has U made it very
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
clear that he's concerned that there's
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
no money in the budget to pay for the
 
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
change to a um a
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
higher um maximum income you're um thank
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
you for two different issues I believe
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
yes um you are correct um this bill was
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
introduced last year by representative
 
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
Murphy it is not the same as House Bill
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
1639 I think was the number from last
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
year by represent Sena of snow you're
 
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
right that bill changed the threshold
 
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
for qualifying to be in the in andout
 
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
spend down program this bill just makes
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
it clear that if you're in the
 
00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519 align:start position:0%
program and um incur mental health
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
treatment costs those count towards your
 
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.389 align:start position:0%
treatment costs those count towards your
spend

00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
down any other questions of Senator
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%

opposition to it in the Senate uh the

Senators agreed that this is a needed
 
00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
modernization in how um Pharmaceuticals

committee believes that that amendment
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
is warranted uh and we think that the
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy should be able to um
 
00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:27.399 align:start position:0%

Woods uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr bosy for taking my question uh
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
just in terms of the time frame it says
 
00:16:04.749 --> 00:16:04.759 align:start position:0%
U that uh uh this will be u rules no
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
later than January the 1st but takes
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
effects uh in 60 days um is that going
 
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
to be a mismatch by chance in terms of
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
getting rules in place within the
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
effective date is of the whole bill
 
00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
authorizing the Board of Pharmacy to
 
00:16:21.309 --> 00:16:21.319 align:start position:0%
start this ruem process and then the the
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
board would have to have the rules done
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
by uh by January so the effective date
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
is for the authorization not the rules
 
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
themselves which would then come later
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
chair um just I just for my own
 
00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
edification um uh a consultant
 
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:49.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacist um I'm not quite sure perhaps
 
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
yourself or even maybe represented
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
Merchant might help me out there not
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
sure exactly what role they might play
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
in this and what what it is uh I I would
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
be curious to find the answer to that as
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
well I'd have to defer representative
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
you represent Woods for the question um
 
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
in long-term care it's required under
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines that each nursing
 
00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.079 align:start position:0%
home has a pharmacist who acts as a
 
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
consultant to the nursing home and also
 
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839 align:start position:0%
to the medical staff and the medical
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
therapy does that answer your
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
question no
 
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
no no not really what role does that
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
person play in in uh this part two in
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
terms of the uh uh
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy the role they play in as far as
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy is concerned it's not so
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
much on the supply chain which is what
 
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
this deals with it's more into the
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
utilization of the drugs within the
 
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
nursing home itself which is where their
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
Consulting comes into play and that's
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things I talked about with
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson and also some other folks
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
I'd like to introduce eventually amend
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the bill to strike out
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
sections 2 3 and four because it does
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
become sort of complicated and I don't
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
think they're needed number one I think
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
the current law actually allows the
 
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy
 
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
to create rules if you will On The Board
 
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
of Pharmacy disagreed so therefore
 
00:18:18.149 --> 00:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson on behalf of the
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
organization that wanted to utilize the
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%

admitted to the room to speak but I
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
don't it there may be a problem with
 
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
their audio I'm not sure uh Mr chairman
 
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
I can speak very very briefly on this on
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
behalf of uh Senator gray I I thought he
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
had intended to be here this morning he
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
may have had technical issues as well uh
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to the details of his
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
section but uh just on his behalf uh
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
this has to do with um healthc care
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
facilities providing care during an
 
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
declared emergency such as the one we
 
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
have right now during covid uh we think
 
00:20:42.669 --> 00:20:42.679 align:start position:0%
this is a a uh timely update to our laws
 
00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:44.919 align:start position:0%
um so that we don't need to operate uh
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
under the emergency declarations that we
 
00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:50.200 align:start position:0%
have something in place in statute uh to
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
give facilities the flexibility they
 
00:20:54.029 --> 00:20:54.039 align:start position:0%
need during a declared emergency and
 
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
once again I'd have to defer on any
 
00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:57.559 align:start position:0%
questions but thank you for your
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
consideration well Senator gray likely
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
to be here because um we do have a
 
00:21:05.149 --> 00:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
specific question for him regarding
 
00:21:05.159 --> 00:21:06.549 align:start position:0%
specific question for him regarding
section

00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
three yeah I'm trying to uh determine
 
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get him online now okay
 
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I have a very
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
broad one that Mr bossy may be able to
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
answer please State your question thank
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
you um so am I am I correct in thinking
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
that the basic
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
thrust of section
 
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
three is to limit the liability of
 
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
healthc care uh facilities that are
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
acting under emergency orders because
 
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes that those actions required
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
under an emergency order do not
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily comport exactly with
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
accepted practices in a non-emergency
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
a representative I've have to defer I'm
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
simply not familiar with this section of
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm I'm trying to get Senator
 
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
gr here for you okay and and Mr chairman
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
I I think that probably somebody from
 
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
the hospital Association could could go
 
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
into it in more depth there may be
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
others as well I'm guessing uh we should
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%

00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
out the the federal piece of this so
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
centers for Medicare and Medicaid
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.190 align:start position:0%
services came out with many waivers um
that

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
that kind of changed the regulations um
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
made things more lenient uh gave the
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and hospitals and others
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
the ability to perform in a way that
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
would allow them to to meet the
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
emergency that was occurring and um and
 
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
and there's so many of them I can't even
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
I can't even tell you how many of them
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
there are um that that CMS came out with
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
the the one thing about putting the CMS
 
00:24:32.669 --> 00:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
waivers into this statute and I just I
 
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out that because
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
the W the waiver is issued by the
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
federal government its compliance the
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
compliance of the health facilities with
 
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
those waivers is up to the federal
 
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
government it's not up to the state to
 
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
make a determination as to whether or
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
not the state of New Hampshire to make a
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
determination as to whether or not those
 
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
facilities were in compliance or were
 
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
not in compliance with those regulations
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
so in in putting um
 
00:25:00.909 --> 00:25:00.919 align:start position:0%
the federal laws or the federal waivers
 
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
I should say waivers to those
 
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
regulations in this it may give people a
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
little bit of a false hope or a false
 
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
sense of security that they won't be uh
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
held liable for um things that may have
 
00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
occurred that were in line with the
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
waivers because it's really up to CMS to
 
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
make that decision one way or the other
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
so I just want to point that out uh
 
00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
certainly the Department's you know not
 
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
not concerned but I just I just want the
 
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:28.120 align:start position:0%
committee to know um that that that is
 
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
something that we identified and just
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out so I happy to answer
 
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:36.669 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out so I happy to answer
any

00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
questions same none uh let me ask again
 
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
is some of the gray on the
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
line Mr chairman I just heard from
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
Senator Gray he's currently chairing the
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
Senate electional Municipal Affairs
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
committee he is trying to get somebody
 
00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
to take over that gavel so he can switch
 
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
zooms and join you uh and he's going to
 
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
get here as soon as he can thank you
 
00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
very much I have um a number of people
 
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify about this bill but
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
because it's three bills um my guess is
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
that some of you are going to be
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
interested in one part and not another
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
and so let me ask those of you who have
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify are interested in
 
00:26:25.389 --> 00:26:25.399 align:start position:0%

emails uh saying that an overdose
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%

00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%

for overdose and I believe to the best
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
of my uh memory you know it has been a
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
few weeks now U that we thought that
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
that was adequately covered in a
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
different bill that we were supporting
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
one thank you thank you any other

also read Jody Fen as well so you're
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
called in one or both hello uh good
 
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman this is Henry veu um
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
I'm here on behalf of Partners Pharmacy
 
00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
and Jody fenin from Partners Pharmacy is
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
also here this morning um if possible if
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
we both could go at the same time I
 
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
think it'd be much more efficient for
 
00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.990 align:start position:0%
think it'd be much more efficient for
your

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
committee yes go ahead yody are you
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
there yes yes I I do apologize I'm at an
 
00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
airport so there's a lot of background
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
noise so on mute when I'm not speaking
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
all right um I I'll just give a little
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
history of why this section is in here
 
00:30:39.149 --> 00:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
um so Partners Pharmacy approached uh
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
the Board of Pharmacy last June about uh
 
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
the ability to do automated Pharmacy
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
systems in long-term care facilities
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and made a
 
00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
presentation to the board uh last summer
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
um and the response from the board was
 
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
that um while it had no issues obviously
 
00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
with uh the systems it felt that uh the
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
organization needed to uh come to the
 
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
legislature to get the statutory
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
authority to move forward with this um
 
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
which was a little confusing uh because
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
3185 uh a 15 uh which speaks to
 
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority for the board it
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
directs the board to develop rules on
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
automated Pharmacy systems and long-term
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
care facilities additionally in RSA
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
318 uh 42 it speaks to automated
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy systems there too but um
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
nonetheless um we approached uh Senator
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
Carson uh to bring a bill in uh to give
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
the statutory authority to the board to
 
00:32:01.389 --> 00:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
adopt these rules um and that is what
 
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
you have before you today um since this
 
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
bill has passed the Senate uh We've
 
00:32:09.789 --> 00:32:09.799 align:start position:0%
Spoken uh with representative Merchant
 
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
um he's very familiar with uh Pharmacy
 
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
issues and um we also spoke with Bob
 
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
Stout who is uh a past chair of the
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy and who was actually
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
uh working uh with a group uh including
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
some individuals on the board to try to
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
put uh some Draft rules together um and
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant I'll let him
 
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
speak to his Amendment but his Amendment
 
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
would make it much more simpler and
 
00:32:40.269 --> 00:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
basically refer to what we believe is
 
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
already the statutory Authority in the
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
law and just basically direct the board
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
to develop the rules so um as Grant
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
bossy mentioned uh there was no
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
opposition at all to this in the Senate
 
00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:56.519 align:start position:0%
um it is already being done in hospital
 
00:32:56.519 --> 00:32:57.990 align:start position:0%
um it is already being done in hospital
facilities

00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
um and this would uh essentially allow
 
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
it in the long-term care facilities jod
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
uh is on the line two in case there are
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
any questions about these um uh systems
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
and I know there was a question about uh
 
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh what kinds of drugs are from
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative woods and I think jod
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
Jody uh is prepared to answer that
 
00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559 align:start position:0%
question so maybe Jody I'll toss it over
 
00:33:23.559 --> 00:33:24.310 align:start position:0%
question so maybe Jody I'll toss it over
to

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh thank you Henry
 
00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
um yes to answer the question first from
 
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative kerk um typically we
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
would put controlled substances into the
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
Automated machine along with
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
non-controlled substances um we would
 
00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
follow whatever guidance there is or
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
registration that's required by the
 
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:50.200 align:start position:0%
individual State as well as uh obtaining
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
a DEA ads registration for off-site uh
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
storage or keep ing of controlled
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
substances that belong to the pharmacy
 
00:34:03.389 --> 00:34:03.399 align:start position:0%
um and then we do have um very stringent
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
reconciliation processes to maintain the
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
um integrity and and security of those
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
Controlled Substances while they are off
 
00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
site um I guess additionally I I will
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
just comment um that this automation has
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
been used since 2002 and I apologize for
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
the noise in the background um and
 
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
currently there are
 
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
approximately 14 plus of the automation
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
that we use um in nursing facilities um
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
in 13 different
 
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
states and um we find that it is
 
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
extremely beneficial it's been very
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
beneficial we've had the most
 
00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
installations um ever in a year during
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
covid time because of the benefits of
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
medication availability right on site
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
for new Admissions and changes in
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
condition um additionally it does
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
benefit infection contr control because
 
00:34:59.710 --> 00:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
the nurses are they get the medications
 
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
in a little envelope they administer and
 
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
then they you know shred destroy that
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
envelope there isn't any continual
 
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
handling of of medication cards or vials
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
or other packaging um and the security
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
measures of maintaining the controls in
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
the Automated machine with every
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
transaction being tracked um for every
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
person that logs in gets a medication
 
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
package meaning a licensed Health Care
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
person not just anyone um that is all
 
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:29.720 align:start position:0%
tracked and um has enhanced safety for
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
management of controlled substances in
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
the nursing
 
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:35.720 align:start position:0%
facilities so those are the those are
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
the Prime benefits of it does anyone
 
00:35:39.069 --> 00:35:39.079 align:start position:0%
have any questions for me that I may
 
00:35:41.069 --> 00:35:41.079 align:start position:0%
need to answer or be able to answer for
 
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
caner yes thank you very much yes uh
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the answer on schedule to
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
the the thing I just want to understand
 
00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit better and I think I got it
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
from what you're saying but I want to
 
00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
clarify so these systems are like
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
basically a machine that will dispense
 
00:36:02.829 --> 00:36:02.839 align:start position:0%
uh prepackaged the dose so is it
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
dispensing a unit dose for a given
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
individual at a given time uh or is it
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
just uh distrib disseminating or I
 
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
should say um dis dispensing the entire
 
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
set for all of that Wing or how does
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
this actually work certainly that that's
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
a great question um the medications we
 
00:36:26.109 --> 00:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
there's a I'm going to call like an
 
00:36:26.119 --> 00:36:27.790 align:start position:0%
there's a I'm going to call like an
automatic

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
automatic
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
run that's set up where all the
 
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
medications for like say residents of a
 
00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
wing for their morning Med pass would be
 
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
packaged but they're packaged individual
 
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
resident it's labeled per resident the
 
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
medications with a description are on an
 
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:44.200 align:start position:0%
envelope and then the nurse has that to
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
administer to that specific resident
 
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
they can also obtain if there's a new
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
order or an emergency order individual
 
00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
doses that are on the resident's profile
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
that would be packaged you know a one
 
00:36:59.550 --> 00:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
you know onetime dose and all of that is
 
00:37:02.589 --> 00:37:02.599 align:start position:0%
tracked to say when it was requested and
 
00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
who obtained it who took it out of the
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
machine when it was packaged follow up
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
follow up and can it handle a PRN
 
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
medication as well absolutely absolutely
 
00:37:16.109 --> 00:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
if it's on the patients profile after
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's been entered into the system by the
 
00:37:20.109 --> 00:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
pharmacy and reviewed by the pharmacist
 
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
then a PRN dose can be removed with all
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
the parameters that exist on a PRN dose
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
such as frequency it can't be if it's um
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
can be given every four hours um as
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
needed they can't get it every two hours
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
they can only get it every 4 hours
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
there's a lock out on the time
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
frame okay thank
 
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
you any further questions uh
 
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
representative pushman thank you thank
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
you can can the members hear me who are
 
00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:55.190 align:start position:0%
you can can the members hear me who are
at

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
home um question is um
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
for um the partners uh people can you
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
guys explain will this how will this
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
help um with new admits if there's
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
no like for instance in a nursing home
 
00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.079 align:start position:0%
sometimes we'll get a new admission and
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
they have medication orders that we
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
don't have on site will this system help
 
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
that is their
 
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
um like a an an emergency kit in this
 
00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.109 align:start position:0%
um like a an an emergency kit in this
machine

00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
machine
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
that can
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
dispense medications we don't have on
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
site already yeah certainly
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative kushman how me how it
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
works there's um up to 176 medications
 
00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
tablets or capsules in um available in
 
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
the machine and it is based on the
 
00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
typical prescribing habits of the
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
Physicians and nurse practitioners and
 
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
um the practitioners in that area and
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
that we modify it to be unique and then
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
there's also emergency type meds IVs and
 
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
so forth um when a new admission comes
 
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
in let's say someone's admitted this
 
00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
morning those orders come over to the
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
pharmacy electronically or faxed over
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
however the the facility transmits them
 
00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
once they're entered into our operating
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
system and a pharmacist reviews them
 
00:39:17.309 --> 00:39:17.319 align:start position:0%
meaning looks for allergies proper
 
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
dosing drug interactions and so forth
 
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
then as soon as the pharmacist literally
 
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
hits the key and says this order or you
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
know each of these indiv ual orders are
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate and approved within
 
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
approximately 2 minutes um just as long
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
as it takes for it to electronically
 
00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
transfer the nurse could go to that
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
machine and get that first dose out um
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
so when someone comes in they don't have
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
to wait for the driver to deliver the
 
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
meds that evening they could get them
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know and start their medications the
 
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
vast majority of them um would be able
 
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
to be started um right from the machine
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
you know within a short period of time
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
after their ad and the facility provides
 
00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
orders anything that's not in the
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
machine the pharmacy delivers you know
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
on an urgent basis um you know or with
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
the routine delivery depending on what
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
the need is um and I will go back to
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative coner the comment about
 
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
the Controlled Substances the pharmacy
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
obtains appropriate prescriptions to
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
meet all the um DEA requirements for
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
Controlled Substances um you know we we
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
have all of that documentation as well
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
so that that need doesn't change we need
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
to get the proper prescriptions from the
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
prescriber but we can take those
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
vs so thank you answer a question yes
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you all right you're welcome well
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
we have the partners partners here um I
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that you're okay
 
00:40:44.829 --> 00:40:44.839 align:start position:0%
with the removal of sections two three
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
and four by Amendment because section
 
00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
five says the board shall adopt rules so
 
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
are you okay should we get an amendment
 
00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
removing two three and four yes sir go
 
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
ahead go ahead yes I'll I'll let you
 
00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:05.079 align:start position:0%
speak to it too also Jody but yes uh
 
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
we're fine with that we basically just
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
want the Board of Pharmacy to feel
 
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
confident that they have the statutory
 
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
authority to move forward with this um
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
we approached the board back like I said
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
last June uh we have the January 1
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
2022 date in there to hopefully put this
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
on the front burner for the board uh to
 
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
to move forward with the rules so uh
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
we're fine uh with removing those other
 
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
uh sections those will get uh done in
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
the rules um and and the the um the
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
statute does speak to what the needs to
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
be included in the rules so um we're
 
00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:46.839 align:start position:0%
fine with uh removing those sections if
 
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
that's what the committee wants to do
 
00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.390 align:start position:0%
that's what the committee wants to do
representative

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
Woods uh thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
00:41:57.069 --> 00:41:57.079 align:start position:0%
you Miss fenin and Mr AO for taking my
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
question uh most of them have been I had
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
several questions about the process uh
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
just uh you mentioned that if the
 
00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
medication is not in uh the the cart as
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
as it's called on the floors um the it
 
00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
can be refreshed uh from um a carrier
 
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
what's the turnaround say it's at 2 in
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
the morning uh and someone comes down
 
00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
with a dire uh diagnosis and needs um um
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
say an antibiotic an IV antibi biotic or
 
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
something like that uh what what is the
 
00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
reliable time frame uh not the average
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
but what's what's a reliable time frame
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
to get that
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
medication um that that time frame if
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
it's not available in the machine would
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
be what we we would typically commit to
 
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
for um you know stat urgent medication
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
which would probably be in the range of
 
00:42:52.549 --> 00:42:52.559 align:start position:0%
you know two three hours which is which
 
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
is quite typical by the time you would
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
fill it in you know transport it to
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
wherever that would be um you know so
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
that commitment doesn't change just
 
00:43:02.829 --> 00:43:02.839 align:start position:0%
because the automation is in the
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
building um you know we still hold by
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
that commitment we don't say you know
 
00:43:09.069 --> 00:43:09.079 align:start position:0%
sorry we we'll send it tomorrow kind of
 
00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
thing that doesn't you know we don't do
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
that we still hold to it um rapid
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
turnaround for Urgent
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
needs thank
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%

Hampshire health system in nashwa I'm
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
very grateful for the chance to briefly
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
speak to you this morning in favor of
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
part three of SB 149 uh I find it
 
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
fascinating and somewhat difficult to
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
wrap my head around that the term
 
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
covid-19 was entirely unknown to most of
 
00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
us until about 14 months ago it was
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
announced as the name of the then
 
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
rapidly spreading novel Corona virus on
 
00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
February 11th of last year between that
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
time and right around this time last
 
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
year in May our country our world um and
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
especially the healthc care and
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management Systems within our
 
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
communities faced unprecedented and in
 
00:45:26.349 --> 00:45:26.359 align:start position:0%
many ways unforeseen challenges um over
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
the course of just days many of you will
 
00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
recall healthc care facilities and their
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
personnel simultaneously grappled with
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
the challenge of on the one hand
 
00:45:37.549 --> 00:45:37.559 align:start position:0%
systematically shutting down all normal
 
00:45:39.549 --> 00:45:39.559 align:start position:0%
non-emergent activities just like
 
00:45:42.549 --> 00:45:42.559 align:start position:0%
virtually all other areas of our society
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh complying with stay-at-home orders
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
and directives while at the very same
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
time and in parallel gearing up as never
 
00:45:52.549 --> 00:45:52.559 align:start position:0%
before to ready ourselves for the
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
projected and potentially overwhelming
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
and unman manageable surges of infected
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
patients the patient surges did come
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
mercifully however again you will recall
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
in most regions of the United States New
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire included hospitals and other
 
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
medical facilities were able to keep
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
Pace with spikes of patients in need of
 
00:46:16.589 --> 00:46:16.599 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services both covid related
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
and otherwise health care facilities and
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
providers were able to effectively rise
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
to meet this emergency in large part
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
because state and federal authorities
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
ities issued various orders rules and
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
waivers permitting changes in the ways
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
that healthc care was delivered changes
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
necessary to respond to covid and which
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
would not have been permitted but for
 
00:46:41.069 --> 00:46:41.079 align:start position:0%
such governmental permission s SP 149
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
part three is narrowly tailored to
 
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
ensure that New Hampshire law just like
 
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
virtually if not literally every other
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
state extends protection from civil
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
liability to licensed Healthcare
 
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
facilities and their personnel for
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
actions in compliance with a covid
 
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
related emergency order rule or waiver
 
00:47:02.829 --> 00:47:02.839 align:start position:0%
from state or federal authorities
 
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
briefly a few examples of the actions to
 
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
comply with covid related orders rules
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
and waivers include the following
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
deferring or delaying non-emergent care

Professionals during this time and still
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
is whether these very same actions to
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
comply with government directives could
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
later give rise to possible civil

liability in the context of a negligence
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
claim in other words could following
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
these orders rules and or waivers be
 
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880 align:start position:0%

below the standard of care during
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
so-called normal times the purpose of SB
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
149 part 3 is to avoid such an
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
inequitable situation such an untenable
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
situation to to protect those who acted
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
as directed under Emergency Management
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
Authority to in order to protect each of
 
00:49:04.789 --> 00:49:04.799 align:start position:0%
us during the State of Emergency the New
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Justice through
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
an opinion of the Attorney General dated
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
April 22nd 2020 confirmed that agent
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
that agency interprets RSA 21p as indeed
 
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
covering healthc care workers following
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
covid guidance as Emergency Management
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
activity while we in healthcare are
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
extremely grateful for this position of
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice respectfully
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
an opinion from the executive branch is
 
00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
simply persuasive not dispositive on the
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
matter and while we consider the AG's
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
opinion to be entirely correct and
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
persuasive it is no substitute for a
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
succinct and clear expression of the
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
legislator's intent so simply put 13
 
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
lines of legislation clarifying RSA 21p
 
00:49:50.589 --> 00:49:50.599 align:start position:0%
is greatly preferable to a five-page
 
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
analysis from the executive branch as
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
helpful as the latter may be in closing
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
I would simply note that there was uh no
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
opposition in the Senate other than a
 
00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
technical issue raised by the trial
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
lawers Association that we were able to
 
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
resolve through discussions and we added
 
00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:08.599 align:start position:0%
on two uh final sentences to the
 
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
proposed language and that uh remedied
 
00:50:13.789 --> 00:50:13.799 align:start position:0%
and assuaged them of any concerns and
 
00:50:15.789 --> 00:50:15.799 align:start position:0%
this uh bill passed unanimously through
 
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate so again thank you for your
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
support of this important effort to
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that New Hampshire's Healthcare
 
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
facilities and providers are not later
 
00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
penalized in the context of civil
 
00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:26.799 align:start position:0%
litigation for what they were called
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
upon to do in order to protect each of
 
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
us our families and our communities
 
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:32.760 align:start position:0%

00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:34.359 align:start position:0%

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
any of your questions thank you very

from the

committee um I think that is
 
00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.150 align:start position:0%
committee um I think that is
representative

[Music]
 
00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
ahead Mr chair and thank you for taking
 
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
this question um apart from civil
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
liability I was wondering if there are
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
any issues with professional liability
 
00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of Licensing and um code of
 
00:51:16.829 --> 00:51:16.839 align:start position:0%
ethics for specific providers in terms
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
of if there are conflicts
 
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
between what they can do under emergency
 
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
orders and what their professional code
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
of ethics say
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
I'm I know this is a different issue but
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
is this covered at all yeah that's a
 
00:51:33.549 --> 00:51:33.559 align:start position:0%
fantastic question and I think it's not
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
clearly covered by this because we tried
 
00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:38.200 align:start position:0%
to narrowly draft this to dock into 21
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
P's immunity from civil liability I
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
think that will unfortunately be
 
00:51:44.349 --> 00:51:44.359 align:start position:0%
something we have to work through with
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
the agencies the AG's office uh and with
 
00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
the courts later down the road in a
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
perfect world which we're certainly not
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
in right now uh we would contemplate
 
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
that sort of professional uh um ethics
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
or lens your standard issue um I think
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
it one could make an argument pretty
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
persuasively that that's derivative of
 
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
this liability immunity but this does
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
not address that head-on representative
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
I think that's something to be worked
 
00:52:11.789 --> 00:52:11.799 align:start position:0%
through uh with the courts and with
 
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
those licensing boards later uh but it's
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
a fantastic issue that I will put my
 
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
thinking cap on about and and see if we
 
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:19.640 align:start position:0%
can perhaps address
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
later thank you thank
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
you anyone else Mr chair
 
00:52:28.789 --> 00:52:28.799 align:start position:0%
I have a question uh representative
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
fome thank you Mr chairman um thank you
 
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
Mr fber for taking my question I well as
 
00:52:39.309 --> 00:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
I was reading this um what came to my
 
00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
mind uh was the whole situation of
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
course in New York State uh where
 
00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
infected patients were sent back to the
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
nursing homes which caused even
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
greater um spread of the virus in an in
 
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
a vulnerable
 
00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:58.670 align:start position:0%
a vulnerable
population

00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh would there
 
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
be room in here if
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
a if someone did not take the time to
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
think through what that would
 
00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.270 align:start position:0%
think through what that would
do

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:23.789 --> 00:53:23.799 align:start position:0%
it but um would they still be could they
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
still be held liable you know I'm just
 
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
thinking about the whole situation in
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
New York and how this might uh play out
 
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
in a situation like that yeah yeah so
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
that's a great example of where uh you
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
can't legislate an answer as this body
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
certainly knows better than I to every
 
00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
possible permutation of the facts and
 
00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
that's a great one that will probably uh
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
have to be dealt with down the road in
 
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
the courts we tried to provide language
 
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
that would allow us to have a
 
00:53:51.549 --> 00:53:51.559 align:start position:0%
conversation around those sorts of
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
topics with the final the second to last
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
sentence indicating that this uh only
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
applies when there's an attempt or
 
00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
reasonable attempt at compliance and
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
that language is used earlier on um the
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
that is intended to convey the fact this
 
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
is not a blanket immunity that when you
 
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
follow that you necessarily everything
 
00:54:11.789 --> 00:54:11.799 align:start position:0%
relating to it is somehow inoculated
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
from liability but rather the party
 
00:54:17.069 --> 00:54:17.079 align:start position:0%
asserting immunity would have to make
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
clear in plain and convince a finder a
 
00:54:21.309 --> 00:54:21.319 align:start position:0%
fact that they indeed were complying
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
with the guidance or reasonably that's
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
the key word attempting to comply
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
unreasonable attempts or uh actions
 
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
beyond the four corners of the actual
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
guidance uh that may be derivative of
 
00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:34.839 align:start position:0%
that guidance would not likely uh
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
provide that kind of immunity so there's
 
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
going to be a fact byct analysis uh on
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
on each case uh and and that's why that
 
00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
language was put in there so that's
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
something to be worked out through the
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
courts later but we thought this was a
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
good framework to at least clarify some
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
of these parameters of liability
 
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
limitation and then deal with the actual
 
00:54:55.789 --> 00:54:55.799 align:start position:0%
Nuance situation ations later through
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
the court so that's that's a great
 
00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
example of where we'll have to figure
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
that out later but this gives us a great
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
jumping off point to make the arguments
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
much more clearly than the AG's opinion
 
00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
um which again is helpful and persuasive
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
but not dispositive um gives
 
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:21.789 --> 00:55:21.799 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:55:23.789 --> 00:55:23.799 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question as a followup
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
to representative
 
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
alome it occurs to me that there are
 
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
actually two parts here and one is the
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable efforts of the actors were
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
talking about to follow an an order but
 
00:55:44.349 --> 00:55:44.359 align:start position:0%
the other is the contents of the order
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
and am I correct in understanding that
 
00:55:52.109 --> 00:55:52.119 align:start position:0%
this bill simply speaks to the
 
00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
facilities that are try and
 
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:55.720 align:start position:0%
practitioners that are trying to carry
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
out the order rather than those who
 
00:56:04.109 --> 00:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
issued the order where correctly or
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
incorrectly to begin
 
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
with 100% correct representative Weber
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what it's intended to
 
00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
address not the latter only the former
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
else thank you very much
 
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
anyone wishing to
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%

biia of New
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hi thank you very much for
 
00:56:47.309 --> 00:56:47.319 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak and uh I'm actually
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
really happy I got to go after John
 
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
fryberg who did a much better job than I
 
00:56:54.029 --> 00:56:54.039 align:start position:0%
would have uh so my testimony will be
 
00:56:57.029 --> 00:56:57.039 align:start position:0%
very short uh the business and industry
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
Association of New Hampshire I should
 
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
say I'm David career director of public
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
policy at uh the business and industry
 
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
Association of New Hampshire uh Bia
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
supports part three of this bill uh we
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
have no position on the rest of it um
 
00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
and the reason being is that healthc
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
care facilities are just trying to do
 
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
their best uh with uh providing care
 
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
during a pandemic which is Quite a feat
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
um and they shouldn't be uh subject to
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
lawsuits uh as a result of trying to
 
00:57:28.349 --> 00:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
comply with emergency orders and trying
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
to do uh the best that they can during
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
the pandemic uh with that I'm happy to
 
00:57:35.549 --> 00:57:35.559 align:start position:0%
take any questions um but like I said I
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
think uh John pyber did a much better
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:46.039 align:start position:0%

for the time he took in um working with
 
00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:17.720 align:start position:0%
our organization and coming up with that
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
carefully crafted language you see in
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
part three um our fear was that this um
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
you know C originally codifying the
 
00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's opinion without um
 
00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
you know this better language I think um
 
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
that John and some of our folks hammered
 
00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
out together um that it could be used
 
00:58:40.829 --> 00:58:40.839 align:start position:0%
over broadly to construe into acts not
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
taken during an emergency so again we
 
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
are happy with this language again want
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
to thank attorney fryberg and um ask the
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%

our hospitals in the state um we wish to
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
comment on part three only of Senate
 
00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 149 and we are very supportive of
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
that section regarding health care
 
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
facilities providing care in a declared
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
emergency and as Mr Creer said um I will
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
do the same um attorney fryberg did an
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
excellent job outlining what the what
 
00:59:39.029 --> 00:59:39.039 align:start position:0%
that section does um and I did um so I
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
will not repeat that um I just wanted to
 
00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
express our um strong support for this
 
00:59:48.029 --> 00:59:48.039 align:start position:0%
section of the bill I did provide a link
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
to the attorney general's um opinion
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
just for your edification and as um Miss
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
Chase said they did um amend the bill um
 
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
working together with attorney Friedberg
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
um which we are F which we completely
 
01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
support um but I just thought it would
 
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
be helpful for your the record to have
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%

01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:15.240 align:start position:0%

Laura
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
burn Laura burn yes thank
 
01:00:46.589 --> 01:00:46.599 align:start position:0%
you hello can you hear me yes oh great
 
01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
hi um thank you for um taking my
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
comments I'm Laura burn I'm the
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
executive director of the HIV hcv
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
Resource Center Center in Lebanon New
 
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're an aid service
 
01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
organization and we run syringe service
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
programming in Grafton and Sullivan
 
01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
County and in Vermont and um it was my
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
understanding that um this bill could
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
possibly pave the way for overdose
 
01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
prevention centers although that part
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
got taken out so I was going to request
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
adding it back in um overdose prevention
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
programs are an evidence-based harm
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
reduction strategy that allows an
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
individual to consume drugs under the
 
01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:27.319 align:start position:0%
supervision of Staff trained to
 
01:01:29.789 --> 01:01:29.799 align:start position:0%
intervene um if that person
 
01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
overdoses and um every year we see our
 
01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
clients overdosing and die so it would
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
be just one other great strategy to um
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
reduce the likelihood of fatal overdose
 
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
they also enhance con connections to
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%

01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:48.680 align:start position:0%

the
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
world um research has also demonstrated
 
01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
these programs decrease the use of
 
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
Emergency Medical Services and reduce
 
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
public drug use and syringe debris so I
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
just wanted to request if there was the
 
01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
possibility of forming a study
 
01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:17.240 align:start position:0%

amendment that is ruled Germain to the
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
bill for us to look at when we exec the
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%

representative

01:02:46.109 --> 01:02:46.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
McKay I may have missed this but the
 
01:02:52.829 --> 01:02:52.839 align:start position:0%
under the fiscal note it says that they
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
have been unable to come up with a
 
01:02:59.269 --> 01:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and that on available it
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
would be sent to the Senate I wonder if
 
01:03:04.269 --> 01:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:12.039 align:start position:0%
that I'm reading it that this is the
 
01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
Senate's fiscal
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
know yeah um we will be executing this
 
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
Bill next week and that's something that
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note writers could be asked
 
01:03:31.359 --> 01:03:33.309 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note writers could be asked
so

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
there yes um if you look on the general
 
01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
court website the current talking
 
01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.109 align:start position:0%
court website the current talking
recognizing

01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
recognizing
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:50.589 --> 01:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
kushman who is doing some research um I
 
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
was just looking at the bill on the
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
general court website and it does have a
 
01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and it um there are zeros
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
across every section of the fiscal
 
01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
note is this fiscal note the same as
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
this fiscal
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
note I didn't get that one I didn't get
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
that one
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
either so but
 
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
probably representative McKay do you
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
have that fiscal
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
note okay gosh I mean why should I be
 
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
the chosen one but I have a fiscal note
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
so I have it it was sent to our um email
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
it was emailed to
 
01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.870 align:start position:0%
it was emailed to
us

01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay yes uh representative H um chairman
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
Pearson uh with regards to Laura Baron's
 
01:04:45.119 --> 01:04:45.990 align:start position:0%
Pearson uh with regards to Laura Baron's
uh

01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.990 align:start position:0%
uh
request

01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
um uh Senator Gray he's not here so I
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
can't ask him mentioned that they took
 
01:04:58.990 --> 01:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
that out that section out because there
 
01:05:02.829 --> 01:05:02.839 align:start position:0%
was a bill another bill that covered
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
that and does anyone know what that bill
 
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
chance Senator Grace said that he would
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
be getting back to us with what that
 
01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
bill is and once again we have until
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
next week to nail that down because if
 
01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:21.640 align:start position:0%
another bill covers this the point
 
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
becomes Moot and if not if we discover
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
that in the next few days that either
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
this doesn't exist or it isn't in to the
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
degree we'd like then any one or more of
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
us can work with Miss burn to come up
 
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
with an amendment that we will look at
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
during the exec session next
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
chairman State your point uh thank you
 
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh couple of things one of which is I
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
wonder if Miss Dyer could be asked to
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
resend the fiscal note when she has a
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
minute and secondly I
 
01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
wonder uh if you could perhaps call
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters who is waiting to testify
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
on this particular issue and who has
 
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
actually sent us the bill as originally
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
drafted so he might be able to clarify
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of those issues thank you
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
very much uh Senator Waters is cent of
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
room also if I can just point out
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
Christina has just sent that s SP 149
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and I've just checked it it
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:43.799 align:start position:0%

01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%

01:06:52.029 --> 01:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
committee Senator David Waters from
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
District 4 and I was the the original
 
01:06:56.589 --> 01:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill that became part of
 
01:06:59.910 --> 01:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
this Omnibus on harm reduction overdose
 
01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:02.200 align:start position:0%
prevention program and um I thinkk I
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
thank the committee for giving me a
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
moment and The Advocates who wanted to
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
um bring this before you for a moment to
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
talk um you had some description of it a
 
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
little bit earlier and if you at the
 
01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
language of the bill um you'll see what
 
01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
was before the Senate and I just want to
 
01:07:24.269 --> 01:07:24.279 align:start position:0%
note um that Senator gray and the and
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
and all the members of the Senate Health
 
01:07:29.789 --> 01:07:29.799 align:start position:0%
Human Services voted in favor of
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
this and it passed the Senate on the
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
floor from the policy committee 23
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
to1 it was sent to finance and there was
 
01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
some objection raised uh to it uh in the
 
01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
finance and that turned the vote when it
 
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
came back to the
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
floor Senator gray um I won't speak for
 
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
him but there were several parts removed
 
01:07:56.069 --> 01:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
from this bill and uh it's possible that
 
01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
there were some other part um that had
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
other things in legislation but I will
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
say that we do not have harm reduction
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
programs and overdose prevention
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
programs like this uh anywhere else or
 
01:08:10.589 --> 01:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
any other bill that I'm I'm aware
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
of and um what the point of this bill is
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
is harm reduction and uh you know I
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
really applaud governor sonunu for
 
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
setting up the doorways program um I
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
serve on the governor's Commission
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drugs and certainly
 
01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has made great strides and
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
many efforts and spent uh you know money
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
and um also receive money through the
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
federal delegation to help deal with the
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
um opioid crisis and we have made a lot
 
01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
of progress but people in the recovery
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
Community feel that the one missing
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
piece all along has been harm
 
01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
reduction that if we create these um
 
01:08:53.789 --> 01:08:53.799 align:start position:0%
sites where people can consume drugs uh
 
01:08:53.799 --> 01:08:54.789 align:start position:0%
sites where people can consume drugs uh
under

01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:08:58.829 --> 01:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
supervision um where they can uh receive
 
01:09:02.669 --> 01:09:02.679 align:start position:0%
medical advice and care if necessary
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
that this is a great next step in
 
01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
fighting the opioid crisis and frankly
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
would save lives in New Hampshire right
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
now the important thing to note about
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
this uh proposal is it is entirely
 
01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.870 align:start position:0%
this uh proposal is it is entirely
enabling

01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
enabling
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
legislation it enables a municipality to
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
make a decision through the public a
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
vote of the public body after public
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
hearings to Institute such a program it
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
may in fact look very familiar to you
 
01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
because it is patterned almost exactly
 
01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
upon the uh legislation you remember
 
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative Hannon and uh Senator
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
gray and I and others worked on for the
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
needle exchange program so it set up in
 
01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
Ju in just that way that um there would
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
be criteria established through Rules by
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
Health and Human
 
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
Services as to what kind of
 
01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
organization uh would be able to host
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
such a site and there's very
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
particular um listing here of the kinds
 
01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
of um facility and also the kinds of
 
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
staff and the and particularly the kinds
 
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
of services that would need to be
 
01:10:07.950 --> 01:10:07.960 align:start position:0%
offered there again quite similar to
 
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
what we see uh in Needle Exchange um
 
01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
program what is also crucial here is
 
01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
that this program could be adopted by
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
the public body of municipality only
 
01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
after it taken certain steps
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
particularly with local law
 
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh with health and human
 
01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
services and others to ensure that
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
public concerns are met and the public G
 
01:10:36.669 --> 01:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
good is served by it it also asked that
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services would conduct
 
01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
a review and study of such a program so
 
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
we would have some real data as to how
 
01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
it works for us as was mentioned there
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
are 165 programs in 10 different uh
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
countries um for a little context the
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
United States uh Philadelphia was on
 
01:10:58.669 --> 01:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
track to establish uh one and there have
 
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
been two different Court rulings down
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
there and the governor asked them to
 
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
delay due to covid and implementing it
 
01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
um so that's a little uncertain though I
 
01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
will say that the um New Administration
 
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
has mentioned harm reduction programs
 
01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
and overdose prevention programs for the
 
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh first time and there's some sense
 
01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
that they will be looked upon favorably
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh by the federal
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
government so um I I save lives um I
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
think it's a program that as described
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
here would work that's what health human
 
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
services and the Senate voted for it
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
unanimously and we had a 23 to1 vote on
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
the policy um but some objections were
 
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
raised about providing such a service um
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
some objections were raised about
 
01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
whether they could be S safely operated
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
and then and some objections were raised
 
01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
about really um philosophically saying
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
that uh this is this is people who was
 
01:11:56.189 --> 01:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
addicted as own fault and the state um
 
01:11:58.629 --> 01:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
Can has provided a lot of services but
 
01:12:01.149 --> 01:12:01.159 align:start position:0%
um shouldn't do this so I don't mean to
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
represent what my some of my colleagues
 
01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
said but I think it's important for you
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
to hear why what was a unanimous vote
 
01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
nearly as unanimous um was overturned at
 
01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
another point in time um I think it's
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
worth considering for your committee um
 
01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
if it decides that it doesn't want to
 
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
add this back into the bill and wants to
 
01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
consider a um a study I'd be happy to
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
work with The Advocates on that but
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
again Mr chairman I really want to thank
 
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
you so much for allowing the opportunity
 
01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
for this to get to to discuss uh before
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
you this is a large drill in a busy day
 
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
so I'd be happy to take any questions uh
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
the chair has a question says
 
01:12:39.070 --> 01:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
representative Mark Pearson it has been
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
said that the substance of your part
 
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
three is covered in another bill
 
01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:50.679 align:start position:0%
um what is that other
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you m thanks for the question
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
I again I I won't speak for Senator gr
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm not aware that there is any such
 
01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
Bill and as I said there were several
 
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
parts of this that were removed and
 
01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps that's that's what he's
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
remembering but I I don't want to speak
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
for him but um that that was not
 
01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
something that was brought up either in
 
01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
the hearing or on either of the debates
 
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
on the Senate
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.629 --> 01:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
is uh the bill that we have before us
 
01:13:22.639 --> 01:13:23.910 align:start position:0%
is uh the bill that we have before us
presently

01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
presently
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
subject to an amendment on part two is
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
probably going to sail out of here
 
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
that's my guess but if part your part
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
three were added it sounds like there
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
may be a sticking spot in the Senate and
 
01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
if it were added it might jeopardize the
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
entire new
 
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
bill um might a better way be adding a
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
line item that makes a study committee
 
01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.149 align:start position:0%
line item that makes a study committee
on

01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:13:57.070 --> 01:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
um harm reduction facilities in your
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
opinion well thank you for that followup
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
and um you know I I uh respect your the
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
wisdom of the house and um I think this
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
is an important way to save lives and if
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
it seems that a study um out based on
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
what is outlined uh in in here would be
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
a way to move forward I I think that is
 
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
a is a is an excellent idea and thank
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
you my fear would be that if we passed
 
01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
it with your section three added and it
 
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
goes to a committee of conference the
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
Senate might reiterate its objection to
 
01:14:35.229 --> 01:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
your part free and the whole thing dies
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
so that is the reason behind my maybe a
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
study committee to bring forth a harm
 
01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
reduction program bill as a standalone
 
01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
Bill might not only serve what you're
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
trying to do but keep the Pres Bill we
 
01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
have before Us
 
01:14:53.629 --> 01:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
Alive um thank you for that I be happy
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
to work with any member of the committee
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
to craft such an amendment with The
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
Advocates and thank you again and thank
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
you Senator and if there are folks in
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
this committee who would like to work
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
with Senator waters for an amendment to
 
01:15:08.189 --> 01:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
add a study committee please be in touch
 
01:15:08.199 --> 01:15:10.229 align:start position:0%
add a study committee please be in touch
with

01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
him there are still
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
questionsa uh Weber's hand up thank you
 
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
um I I have I have a comment on the uh
 
01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
process of of Committees of
 
01:15:28.629 --> 01:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
conference uh there's no reason why if
 
01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
one gets into a committee of conference
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
particular aspect of the be bill becomes
 
01:15:38.189 --> 01:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
a sticking point it is absolutely
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
possible that the whole thing dies but
 
01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
the other possibility of course is that
 
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
it's just removed again so it's not an
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
All or Nothing proposition but I concede
 
01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
that there are issues
 
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
of that that need to be uh tactics that
 
01:15:56.669 --> 01:15:56.679 align:start position:0%
need to be considered but my question
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
for Senator Waters is that
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
um when the bill when the section was
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
removed in the finance committee I
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
understand some of the uh policy
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
objections but were there actual Finance
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
objections in the finance committee or
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
were the objections there on a policy
 
01:16:22.030 --> 01:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
basis thank you for your question uh I'm
 
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
not aware of any objections on a on a
 
01:16:26.669 --> 01:16:26.679 align:start position:0%
financial basis um Health and Human
 
01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
Services didn't bring forward any
 
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
concerns about cost uh and it was felt
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
that grants that certainly would be a
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
lot of Grant support for um this if a
 
01:16:38.669 --> 01:16:38.679 align:start position:0%
municipality decide to move forward it
 
01:16:41.629 --> 01:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
really was um some objections which you
 
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
know it had passed 23 to1 before but
 
01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
some objections
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
arose after that and that you know that
 
01:16:49.149 --> 01:16:49.159 align:start position:0%
that happens sometimes doesn't it but uh
 
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
there were not there were not um Finance
 
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh objections
 
01:16:55.709 --> 01:16:55.719 align:start position:0%
um that I that I'm aware of and ever
 
01:16:55.719 --> 01:16:56.550 align:start position:0%
um that I that I'm aware of and ever
being

01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:07.470 --> 01:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
Woods no I my hands not up sorry it
 
01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
might be floaters after my eye surgery
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh is there any other hand up just
 
01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
uh former representative Hannon wants to
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
testify former representative and
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
alumnus of this committee Hannon you are
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.149 --> 01:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Joe Hannon uh
 
01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
like you heard others say that I was
 
01:17:34.030 --> 01:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
very involved with the syringe uh
 
01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
service Bill uh with Senator Waters and
 
01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
Senator gray and and many of you also on
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
um the fact that it was removed I
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
understand some of the objections but I
 
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
do think that at the very least it needs
 
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
to be studied at a little bit more of a
 
01:17:51.149 --> 01:17:51.159 align:start position:0%
level than just a committee level I
 
01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
think it should be studied as a
 
01:17:52.199 --> 01:17:53.550 align:start position:0%
think it should be studied as a
commission

01:17:53.550 --> 01:17:53.560 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh I have uh submitted uh actual
 
01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:57.639 align:start position:0%
language that'll save everyone some time
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
everyone wants to work on a bill I
 
01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
already have the language completely
 
01:18:02.189 --> 01:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
drafted if he'd like to amend it in some
 
01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
way that's fine I'd be happy to discuss
 
01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
it but I submitted that to
 
01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
representative salaway and I believe he
 
01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
shared it with other members of the
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
committee I'm not sure if everyone has
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
it yet um so I I've been actively
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
involved with seren service programs in
 
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
the state and that was a big step in
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
harm reduction uh in this in New
 
01:18:24.629 --> 01:18:24.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 2020 according to the
 
01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
office of National Drug control policy
 
01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths Rose by
 
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
16.6% based on comparison between
 
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
January and April of the previous year
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
Nationwide in New Hampshire that wasn't
 
01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
the case Manchester saw a 28% decrease
 
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
in opioid related overdose deaths in
 
01:18:44.590 --> 01:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
2020 compared to
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
2019 um there was a serin service
 
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
program that was instituted not long
 
01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
before that in Manchester and also so we
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
had one previously in the Sea Coast we
 
01:18:57.310 --> 01:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
had done a survey of our residents and
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
over 3,000 overdoses had been reversed
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
by members of our uh Exchange program in
 
01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
the Queen City 3,000 overdoses since the
 
01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
Inception uh at the in in that City
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's more than were reversed in the
 
01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals and by the the paramedics in
 
01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
that area not to diminish their their
 
01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
efforts but the efforts were uh most
 
01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
substantial in the front lines with the
 
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
people who were actually involved in the
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
process so I'd like to also say that uh
 
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
if we do a study commission we can study
 
01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
the standards for bre practices look at
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
the data that's been out there like the
 
01:19:36.669 --> 01:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
previous speaker La burn said this has
 
01:19:39.629 --> 01:19:39.639 align:start position:0%
been involved in at least 10 other
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
countries there are over 165 programs
 
01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
around the world we could also discuss
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
and study the feasibility of
 
01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
implementing these programs in New
 
01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where can they be best
 
01:19:50.669 --> 01:19:50.679 align:start position:0%
utilized if at all so even if you're not
 
01:19:52.590 --> 01:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
in favor of such a program for whatever
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
reason reason that commission would have
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
the ability to discuss whether it's
 
01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
actually feasible and where it can be
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
best done in New Hampshire um I'd be
 
01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions but this is
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
something that is absolutely
 
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
life-saving um if we can reduce overdose
 
01:20:11.629 --> 01:20:11.639 align:start position:0%
deaths and overdoses in general by
 
01:20:13.149 --> 01:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
having these kind of facilities in the
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
future possibly we could decrease HIV
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
hepatitis C transmission overdose deaths
 
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
we can increase referrals to treatment
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
and Recovery Services and other
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
um other other services for social
 
01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
services for people that are high risk
 
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
or homeless uninsured or low income and
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
also and this is a very timely issue uh
 
01:20:38.189 --> 01:20:38.199 align:start position:0%
overdoses and uh infections and other
 
01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
problems associated with improper uh
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
substance use could be um actually do
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
contribute to hospital usage and
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
increased uses in the H increased uses
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
in the hospital can actually take away
 
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh the time of healthc care providers to
 
01:20:56.910 --> 01:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
treat other illnesses like covid
 
01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
infections and other life-threatening
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%
illnesses so this does free up this the
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh Health Care um system we have it also
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
will save an incredible amount of money
 
01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:10.360 align:start position:0%
and uh not just money in tangible assets
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
but in in the fact that it will also
 
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
save lives and um help get people into
 
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
treatment and recovery so I the language
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
is there if I'd like to uh I'd like I'd
 
01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
be happy to work with anyone in the
 
01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
future and um I'd be happy to take any
 
01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
questions whatsoever thank
 
01:21:28.199 --> 01:21:29.709 align:start position:0%
questions whatsoever thank
youa

01:21:29.709 --> 01:21:29.719 align:start position:0%
youa
 
01:21:33.629 --> 01:21:33.639 align:start position:0%
F thank you uh chairman Pearson um thank
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr Hannon for taking my question I
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
have recently been appointed to uh the
 
01:21:43.229 --> 01:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
drug overdose fatality review commission
 
01:21:45.790 --> 01:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
um so I would really like to get the
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
language uh sent to me for your
 
01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment um I have not familiarized
 
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
myself too much yet with this new
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
commission I've been assigned to but
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
would that be an appropriate commission
 
01:21:59.790 --> 01:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
that already exists that could could uh
 
01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:00.990 align:start position:0%
that already exists that could could uh
review

01:22:00.990 --> 01:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
review
 
01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
this uh absolutely I don't believe it
 
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
was on um it's it's actually in the on
 
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
the list I have 12 members but on
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
obviously this is just a basic framework
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of it was taken from the
 
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
syringe uh the the the commission to
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
study hypodermic needles and syringes
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
which I was the chair of that commission
 
01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
um we did change it a little bit uh to
 
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
add a few members but I'd be happy to
 
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
add that commission to this
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
list okay um yeah if you would follow
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%

please um Senator gray alluded to Prior
 
01:22:59.950 --> 01:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
legislation that obviated the need for
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
this section of the bill do you have any
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%

legislation and I I went through the
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
last Senate calendar to see if there
 
01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:15.719 align:start position:0%
were amendments but maybe there's

colleagues um uh representative Weber uh

01:23:42.669 --> 01:23:42.679 align:start position:0%
language and a second amendment to
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
establish a commission uh so that we can
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%

terminology and some processes the only
 
01:28:03.550 --> 01:28:03.560 align:start position:0%
significant policy change is in access

statute use gender neutral terminology
 
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
which we did throughout the document it
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
is a very large um St U bill and I
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
understand that and that's why we have a
 
01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:28.119 align:start position:0%
lot of um individuals um on that can
 
01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
address um the legal and the CL clinical
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
um components so I will defer to them
 
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
but um I just wanted to mention that um
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
after the bill was heard in the Senate
 
01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
um Senator Sherman did bring together
 
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
number of interested stakeholders again
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
that will be testifying we did spend um
 
01:32:50.109 --> 01:32:50.119 align:start position:0%

01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
them went over two hours at length and
 
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
so um with everyone's input encouraged
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
and and considered the final that is the
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
final product of the work of the
 
01:33:01.629 --> 01:33:01.639 align:start position:0%

01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
want to make clear that we um that we
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%

01:33:31.629 --> 01:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
policy relative to this statute and as
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
Senator Sherman had indicated when he

01:35:39.229 --> 01:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
the state law this gives us a good sense
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
of the questions that are out there um
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
both with healthc Care Professionals as

what you'll hear from the Coalition

01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
of the shortcomings may be and confusion
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
is caused
 
01:35:53.709 --> 01:35:53.719 align:start position:0%
the Coalition members have raised the
 
01:35:55.629 --> 01:35:55.639 align:start position:0%
suggestions outlined in the bill as a
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%

01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
public and from healthc Care
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
Professionals and those that deal with
 
01:36:02.910 --> 01:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
the form and the statute we believe that
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
these changes uh before you today will
 
01:36:06.510 --> 01:36:06.520 align:start position:0%

patients whatever they may be will be
 
01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
clearly understood and executed when the
 
01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:13.480 align:start position:0%

01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have this is the
 
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
chairman uh representative mark PE do
 
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
you have the bill in front of
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
you the bill in front of me I can pull
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:55.870 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:36:55.870 --> 01:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
following m 30 to surate yes is that
 
01:37:19.870 --> 01:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
correct line in accordance with an agent
 
01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
or surrogate May revoke
 
01:37:26.350 --> 01:37:26.360 align:start position:0%
the DNR or a pulsed for a principal who
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
lacks capacity to make Health Care
 
01:37:33.550 --> 01:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
decisions but presumably that person was
 
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
capable of making those decisions where
 
01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
those decisions were first made it says
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
to me that when a person no longer has
 
01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:43.629 align:start position:0%
to me that when a person no longer has
the

01:37:43.629 --> 01:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
capacity people change the desires of
 
01:37:51.229 --> 01:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
the principle of the individual that
 
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
that's what it says seems to say to me
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
and in this paragraph it's at a health
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
care facility in the next paragraph it
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
is outside of Health Care Facility same
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
language except the venue has
 
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
changed to me seems to say that when a
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
person no longer has capacity people can
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
go against that person's Express written
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
desires is that correct am I reading it
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
correctly I'm GNA have to defer that
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
question to some of the legal experts
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
who I know will be testifying later um
 
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
what I will say is what we want to do is
 
01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
ensure that the person that a patient
 
01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
designates as their surrogate has
 
01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
clearly understood uh lanes that they
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
can operate in and so that's what um
 
01:38:36.189 --> 01:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
we're wishing to clarify but as far as
 
01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
the Precision of your question I would
 
01:38:40.229 --> 01:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
ask to defer that to some other legal
 
01:38:43.149 --> 01:38:43.159 align:start position:0%
folks who'll be testifying later my
 
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:53.950 --> 01:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
Ames I I see a hand waving it looks like
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
representative kerk's
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
hand thank you and um if if uh if if Mr
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
Ames is the appropriate person that's
 
01:39:03.550 --> 01:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
one thing that I wanted to check on on
 
01:39:07.149 --> 01:39:07.159 align:start position:0%
page four line
 
01:39:09.550 --> 01:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
34 where we have the
 
01:39:12.510 --> 01:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
definitions um in that we have the
 
01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:15.159 align:start position:0%
definition of post which states that it
 
01:39:16.589 --> 01:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
means a form that contains a set of
 
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
emergency orders but would it also be
 
01:39:21.550 --> 01:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate for us to Define find what
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
the acronym stands for because I could
 
01:39:25.870 --> 01:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
never find the acronym actually spelled
 
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
out in the bill and I think that acronym
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
meetings do change over time um and
 
01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
pulst is a little newer than DNR would
 
01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:37.639 align:start position:0%
there be any objection to just simply uh
 
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
identifying that it's a what is it
 
01:39:41.550 --> 01:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
physician order life sustaining
 
01:39:43.229 --> 01:39:43.239 align:start position:0%
treatment that just have that in
 
01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
parenthesis so it clarifies what the
 
01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
acronym stands for would that be
 
01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I think as far as changing the
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
the B leave that to other folks to make
 
01:39:53.550 --> 01:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
the decision if that would be
 
01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate pulst as you mentioned you
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
know is a acronym um and it's commonly
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
used one in the field but I understand
 
01:40:02.189 --> 01:40:02.199 align:start position:0%
your point about making sure it's
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:10.510 --> 01:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
represent thank you um chairman may I um
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%
this is Paula may I
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
speak can you hear
 
01:40:20.109 --> 01:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
me yes you may um so there are others
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
that could address this I believe um Dr
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
um Phil Lawson is on the phone and I
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
think he can address this um post um is
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
now considered not really an acronym um
 
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
representative kerk is right it used to
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
be but nationally they're moving to just
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
having puls be actually um the name if
 
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
you will moving from an acronym to the
 
01:40:47.790 --> 01:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
um the what it um just referring to
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
pulst as as a a name in in and of itself
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
so um we actually had some experts that
 
01:40:56.229 --> 01:40:56.239 align:start position:0%
deal with post a lot and again if if Dr
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
Lawson is on the phone I think he can um
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
he can he can address this more
 
01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
effectively but that was intentional um
 
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
as to why we we did created the
 
01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:09.239 align:start position:0%
definition the way we did um we actually
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
had quite a bit of discussion about that
 
01:41:14.030 --> 01:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
actually um so but we'll I'll let Dr
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
Lawson um talk about that sure is going
 
01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
in a different direction uh
 
01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative fulson um thank you
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you uh Miss Mahan uh
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
can you please tell us what the original
 
01:41:32.109 --> 01:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:35.709 --> 01:41:35.719 align:start position:0%
was it is um physici order life
 
01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
sustaining treatment I believe and maybe
 
01:41:41.790 --> 01:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
practitioner order I'm not 100% sure but
 
01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
life sustaining treatment again um Dr
 
01:41:48.589 --> 01:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
Lawson is a paliative care doctor and
 
01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
utilizes pulst forms he can explain exp
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
Lain um how they how they are utilized
 
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
but that's my I believe what the
 
01:41:57.310 --> 01:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
original acronym there is an amend there
 
01:42:00.910 --> 01:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
is excuse me a statute um for puls in
 
01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
our state law um it is really more um
 
01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
kind of enabling legislation um it's not
 
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
um but it's something actually that came
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
up during one of our um discussions that
 
01:42:16.109 --> 01:42:16.119 align:start position:0%
that statute may need to be modified to
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
be more clear um and um kind of bring it
 
01:42:21.709 --> 01:42:21.719 align:start position:0%
up to the National Standard which um New
 
01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is trying to follow a number
 
01:42:26.589 --> 01:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
of states follow um the pulse national
 
01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
standards um because representative kerk
 
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
is right this is a new um relatively new
 
01:42:37.709 --> 01:42:37.719 align:start position:0%
um um addition to to physician ordering
 
01:42:41.229 --> 01:42:41.239 align:start position:0%
um emergency medical orders so it it did
 
01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
come up um but not in the context of
 
01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
changing this particular
 
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
statute you representative thank you m
 
01:42:53.310 --> 01:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
manahan and Mr angs and uh are there any
 
01:42:56.589 --> 01:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
other questions for uh Peter am
 
01:42:58.510 --> 01:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
executive director of the foundation of
 
01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:01.390 align:start position:0%
executive director of the foundation of
Healthy

01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
Communities um I I don't see who's
 
01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
behind the waving hand represent Marsh
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh oh okay thank you
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh you may be able to answer
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
this question better than than Peter did
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
but the chair asked about uh the
 
01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
sections of the bill on page uh 23 and
 
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
24 whether they would allow someone to
 
01:43:29.950 --> 01:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
revoke someone's uh DNR order at a later
 
01:43:32.030 --> 01:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
date when they became incompetent am I
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
correct that under current law that is
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
allowed but the way this bill changes
 
01:43:38.790 --> 01:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
existing law is it adds the phrase in
 
01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
accordance with RSA 137 j6 which might
 
01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
turn to page eight in the bill is a
 
01:43:46.270 --> 01:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
requirement to act in accordance with
 
01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
the principal wishes and best interests
 
01:43:51.390 --> 01:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
so in fact what this bill does is limit
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
the the ability for someone to change
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
someone's orders when they lose
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
competency later in life yes I I agree
 
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
with you representative Marsh I was
 
01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:03.320 align:start position:0%
doing the same to make sure the cross
 
01:44:06.270 --> 01:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
reference but again there are some um
 
01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
lawyers on the phone that I think could
 
01:44:11.709 --> 01:44:11.719 align:start position:0%
also address that question um if um if
 
01:44:14.430 --> 01:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
attorney Hannah is on the phone or
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
attorney Hillman I think both of them
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
could um properly address that as well
 
01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
and clarify any other um legal questions
 
01:44:24.510 --> 01:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that question thank you
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
then the chair we'll um recognize um
 
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
attorney Helman to speak to this
 
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
point and if you have prepared remarks
 
01:44:35.589 --> 01:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
for something else please hold out to
 
01:44:38.589 --> 01:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
them address that question chairman but
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant still had his
 
01:44:43.589 --> 01:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
hand up for these people testify I
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
understand thank you please call up
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh attorney Helman yes this is Attorney

Ben Benjamin syracusa Hillman would you
 
01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
like me to just address the the question
 
01:44:58.750 --> 01:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
um yes regarding page 23 to 24 okay uh
 
01:45:00.510 --> 01:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
good good morning uh my name is Benjamin
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
Syracuse Hillman I'm an attorney at uh
 
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
Shaheen and Gordon and I was one of the
 
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
members of the stakeholder groups that
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
worked on the bill and I'll look forward
 
01:45:11.589 --> 01:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
to testifying at at greater length um
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
later on in the in the meeting but
 
01:45:16.750 --> 01:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
regarding the question uh that was asked
 
01:45:19.709 --> 01:45:19.719 align:start position:0%
um I agree with the the clarification
 
01:45:21.229 --> 01:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
that the representative have stated
 
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
regarding um the change to existing law
 
01:45:28.149 --> 01:45:28.159 align:start position:0%
is to actually add the phrase in
 
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
accordance with RSA 137
 
01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
j6 um I would also add though I think
 
01:45:35.550 --> 01:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
more significantly and and Dr Lawson can
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps address this as well a do not
 
01:45:41.189 --> 01:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
resuscitate order or a pulst order um
 
01:45:44.589 --> 01:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
those are medical orders done by a um by
 
01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
a physician or other practitioner so as
 
01:45:49.709 --> 01:45:49.719 align:start position:0%
distinct from a durable power of
 
01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
attorney for health healthare living
 
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
will or other directive documents signed
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
by an individual patient um the the
 
01:45:59.550 --> 01:45:59.560 align:start position:0%
orders being reference to are medical
 
01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
orders so the statute does not the
 
01:46:06.510 --> 01:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill does not give an indivi uh
 
01:46:08.589 --> 01:46:08.599 align:start position:0%
an agent or surrogate the ability to
 
01:46:11.310 --> 01:46:11.320 align:start position:0%
revoke an advanced directive the ability
 
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
to revoke a durable power of attorney
 
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
for healthcare or living will signed by
 
01:46:16.910 --> 01:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
the patient what it does do is it allows
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
the agent to consent or the surrogate to
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
consent to physician revoking a
 
01:46:24.189 --> 01:46:24.199 align:start position:0%
physician order um and and again that
 
01:46:25.870 --> 01:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
has to be done in a way consistent with
 
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
the principal best interests and and
 
01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:32.950 align:start position:0%
the principal best interests and and
expressed

01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
wishes that really doesn't quite explain
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
it enough for me if a person s of Mind
 
01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
signs a statement do not resuscitate me
 
01:46:50.669 --> 01:46:50.679 align:start position:0%
is that the end of the story or May
 
01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
others countermand
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
that if an individual signs an advanced
 
01:46:59.790 --> 01:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
directive and in that directive provides
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
instructions that they do not wish
 
01:47:05.070 --> 01:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
resuscitation that directive itself
 
01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:06.310 align:start position:0%
resuscitation that directive itself
cannot

01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
01:47:09.709 --> 01:47:09.719 align:start position:0%
be cannot be set aside by the agent that
 
01:47:12.270 --> 01:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
directive would the agent would have no
 
01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
power to revoke that directive but what
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're speaking of here is a medical do
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
not resuscitate order which an
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
individual cannot do for themselves it
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
has to be done by a practitioner um and
 
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
so if an individual's practitioner does
 
01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
a do not resuscitate order consistent
 
01:47:29.950 --> 01:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
with the wishes of the individual and
 
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
the individual is
 
01:47:35.229 --> 01:47:35.239 align:start position:0%
incapacitated the agent or surrogate if
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
based on a determination that that was
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
consistent with the patient's wishes and
 
01:47:41.550 --> 01:47:41.560 align:start position:0%
best interests would have the ability to
 
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
consent to the practitioner revoking
 
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
that order so they can't they cannot
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
revoke a written statement of the
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
individual but they can consent to a to
 
01:47:53.310 --> 01:47:53.320 align:start position:0%
a a medical practitioner revoking the
 
01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
medical practitioner's order do not
 
01:47:59.270 --> 01:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
resuscitate or pulst order let me na it
 
01:48:02.189 --> 01:48:02.199 align:start position:0%
down if an individual says do not
 
01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry sir I I I couldn't
 
01:48:12.510 --> 01:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
understand the last thing you said it
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
the connection wasn't great if an
 
01:48:18.629 --> 01:48:18.639 align:start position:0%
individual signs of sound mind signs a
 
01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
DNR let's leave a out of it for a minute
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
May a
 
01:48:28.109 --> 01:48:28.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
that an individual cannot sign their own
 
01:48:34.589 --> 01:48:34.599 align:start position:0%
DNR it has to be done by a physician so
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
so there is no such thing as an
 
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
individual doing their own DNR an
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
individual can sign an advanced
 
01:48:43.390 --> 01:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
directive so an individual can express
 
01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
their wish in the directive that they do
 
01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
not wish to be resuscitated under
 
01:48:49.870 --> 01:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
various circumstances but then for that
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
to have practical effect it is typically
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
embodied in a medical order by their
 
01:48:56.910 --> 01:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
practitioner the practitioner has the
 
01:48:58.830 --> 01:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
ability to alter or amend their medical
 
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
order but not the individual's own
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
underlying statement that gave rise to
 
01:49:03.199 --> 01:49:05.870 align:start position:0%
underlying statement that gave rise to
that

01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
order representative kushman thank you
 
01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman can you explain in what
 
01:49:18.350 --> 01:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
circumstance a doctor would be revoking
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
such an order
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
I would like to refer to defer to Dr
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
Lawson as a um medical provider who who
 
01:49:28.350 --> 01:49:28.360 align:start position:0%
would be able to give a better answer to
 
01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:30.189 align:start position:0%
would be able to give a better answer to
that

01:49:30.189 --> 01:49:30.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:32.589 --> 01:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
question okay while we're trying to mail
 
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
down this answer uh the chair will then
 
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:42.589 --> 01:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
this with with respect Mr chairman
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
several of us had questions of the
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
person who was
 
01:49:51.589 --> 01:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
testifying that might CL clarify this if
 
01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
he were allowed to finish with all of
 
01:49:57.990 --> 01:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
our questions it's very unusual to jump
 
01:49:59.830 --> 01:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
from person to person to person to
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
person in the course of testimony I've
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
never seen it done before ever uh so I
 
01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
just want to register that but I I did
 
01:50:11.470 --> 01:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
have a question that I thought might
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
help clarify if I could have asked it of
 
01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
the original person but you're the chair
 
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
well it's unusual for me to do the
 
01:50:22.350 --> 01:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
handoff where one testifier calls on
 
01:50:24.709 --> 01:50:24.719 align:start position:0%
another testifier who calls on another
 
01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:27.320 align:start position:0%
testifier but I find myself doing this
 
01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
because I I believe myself and I'm
 
01:50:32.109 --> 01:50:32.119 align:start position:0%
looking at a few other people do not
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
have an answer to our question that
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
explains it adequately to us but
 
01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
normally we finish with the first person
 
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
and and then the next person who comes
 
01:50:44.910 --> 01:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
takes up the work as it were and answers
 
01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
the questions that were not appropriate
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
for the earlier person ra rather than
 
01:50:52.270 --> 01:50:52.280 align:start position:0%
calling people in and then putting them
 
01:50:56.109 --> 01:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
back out again and and and it it's
 
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
generally the practice that we hold the
 
01:51:00.910 --> 01:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
questions for the person who's the
 
01:51:03.310 --> 01:51:03.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate person but we don't just
 
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
call that person up to testify on one
 
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
question and then send them back and go
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
back to the person before I do thank you
 
01:51:12.109 --> 01:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
for that and I'm going in a different
 
01:51:15.589 --> 01:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
direction I'm calling on Dr Lawson to
 
01:51:17.870 --> 01:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
try to nail down an answer to this
 
01:51:20.350 --> 01:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
question under what circumstances May a
 
01:51:22.910 --> 01:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
person's expressed desire do not
 
01:51:26.069 --> 01:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
resuscitate me can't that be overruled
 
01:51:29.189 --> 01:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
by someone else so I've been told that
 
01:51:39.550 --> 01:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
this sorry I I hope you can hear me now
 
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
yes we can right so I'm Dr Philip Lawson
 
01:51:48.270 --> 01:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
I'm a paliative care consultant at
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
Littleton Regional Health Care I'm also
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
an emergency department physician and
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
practiced as a primary care clinician at
 
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
amusa community health for about 20
 
01:51:59.550 --> 01:51:59.560 align:start position:0%
years uh I do have extensive experience
 
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:02.360 align:start position:0%
in this and and I'm one of the trainers
 
01:52:05.189 --> 01:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
that Peter uh referred to in his
 
01:52:08.350 --> 01:52:08.360 align:start position:0%
introduction in answer to this question
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
um the short answer is yes but the long
 
01:52:15.510 --> 01:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
answer is in very rare
 
01:52:17.950 --> 01:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
circumstance uh I think representative
 
01:52:21.310 --> 01:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
kushman asked for specific circumstance
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh one might be a situation where a
 
01:52:26.350 --> 01:52:26.360 align:start position:0%
person had an advanced cancer had a
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
temporary loss of
 
01:52:31.470 --> 01:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
capacity had signed a do not attempt
 
01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:32.950 align:start position:0%
capacity had signed a do not attempt
resuscitation

01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
resuscitation
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
order understanding their prognosis was
 
01:52:39.870 --> 01:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
poor and a new therapy arose that was
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
exceptionally effective and could
 
01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
significantly change their uh prognosis
 
01:52:47.350 --> 01:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
and the durable power of attorney in
 
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
that circumstance May interet
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
the individual's wishes to be one where
 
01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
they would want to change that order
 
01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
innumerable and
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
unpredictable potential circumstances
 
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
from a medical
 
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
perspective that could lead to a change
 
01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
in prognosis and it is impossible to
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
fully predict all the potential
 
01:53:16.830 --> 01:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances that may occur in the
 
01:53:20.350 --> 01:53:20.360 align:start position:0%
future in regards to what is going to
 
01:53:21.790 --> 01:53:21.800 align:start position:0%
occur to an
 
01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
individual uh regarding their medical
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
treatment and for this reason although
 
01:53:30.109 --> 01:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
there are concerns as you imply with the
 
01:53:33.669 --> 01:53:33.679 align:start position:0%
ability of a durable power to override a
 
01:53:35.550 --> 01:53:35.560 align:start position:0%
previous uh
 
01:53:39.629 --> 01:53:39.639 align:start position:0%
request in some the medical field
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
certainly believes and it is our
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
experience that the benefits
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
significantly outweigh the risks and
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
harms when it comes to the issue of a
 
01:53:55.069 --> 01:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
durable power of attorney's authority to
 
01:53:58.750 --> 01:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
override a previous um statement that
 
01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
has always been the case in existing law
 
01:54:03.629 --> 01:54:03.639 align:start position:0%
and it is always the standard of
 
01:54:05.950 --> 01:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
practice in SB
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
74 our goal was to strengthen that by
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
the reference to the necessity for an
 
01:54:16.830 --> 01:54:16.840 align:start position:0%
individual including the agent as well
 
01:54:20.069 --> 01:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
as the medical team to honor the wishes
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
of the patient to refer back to that
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
section as uh representative Marsh uh
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
discussed so it is an issue uh
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative but in the opinion of the
 
01:54:35.189 --> 01:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
medical community and certainly the
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
healthc care decisions
 
01:54:40.189 --> 01:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
Coalition the benefits of continuing to
 
01:54:42.189 --> 01:54:42.199 align:start position:0%
allow that
 
01:54:45.669 --> 01:54:45.679 align:start position:0%
Authority outweigh the potential harms I
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
hope that answers your question it does
 
01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
doctor now the Chairman's happy
 
01:54:52.589 --> 01:54:52.599 align:start position:0%
everybody can be happy
 
01:54:56.589 --> 01:54:56.599 align:start position:0%
again um we go back to where were we
 
01:54:59.310 --> 01:54:59.320 align:start position:0%
with people's hands up is it with uh
 
01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:00.709 align:start position:0%
with people's hands up is it with uh
Peter

01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
Peter
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
angs or Laura minahan those of you who
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
once had your hands up want to put them
 
01:55:06.910 --> 01:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
back up and who were you wanting to
 
01:55:10.430 --> 01:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
speak to representative
 
01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
Weber well I'm now wanting to speak to
 
01:55:18.510 --> 01:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
the good doctor if I may oh yeah as a
 
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
followup to your line of
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
questioning um and I have two if I might
 
01:55:26.310 --> 01:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
the first
 
01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
is just a straight question is it
 
01:55:34.069 --> 01:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
possible that one of the important
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
functions of this
 
01:55:40.270 --> 01:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
language is so that if the surrogate who
 
01:55:43.069 --> 01:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
knows or or the agent or the surrogate
 
01:55:46.109 --> 01:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
who knows the patient well believes that
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
a practitioner acting in all good faith
 
01:55:53.229 --> 01:55:53.239 align:start position:0%
simply got the patient's wishes
 
01:55:58.149 --> 01:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
wrong the agent or surrogate may require
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
the practitioner who in all good faith
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
got it wrong to do what the agent or
 
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
surrogate really really thinks that the
 
01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:09.430 align:start position:0%
surrogate really really thinks that the
individual

01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:56:13.229 --> 01:56:13.239 align:start position:0%
wanted is that one of the purposes of
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
this uh yes I mean and that always has
 
01:56:18.270 --> 01:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
been the case representative Weber as
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
well a agent or surrogate or anyone in
 
01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
fact acting on behalf of a a patient
 
01:56:27.669 --> 01:56:27.679 align:start position:0%
although legally we refer to the
 
01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
hierarchy of legal Authority in reality
 
01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
medically we have family meetings we get
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
together everybody and we sit down and
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
we work for consensus to best understand
 
01:56:39.709 --> 01:56:39.719 align:start position:0%
the values and the goals and wishes of
 
01:56:42.189 --> 01:56:42.199 align:start position:0%
the individual who is unable to advocate
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
for themselves and that that's the
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
standard of care um but yes um and if
 
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
there was irre ilable differences where
 
01:56:54.350 --> 01:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
a clinician a
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
practitioner could not agree that would
 
01:56:58.750 --> 01:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
be a situation that would go to an
 
01:57:02.189 --> 01:57:02.199 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee um as an example that
 
01:57:04.270 --> 01:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
would be where the next step would be to
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
to help resolve that there are very very
 
01:57:09.790 --> 01:57:09.800 align:start position:0%
few situations and in my experience we
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
are a a unfortunately overly legally
 
01:57:16.709 --> 01:57:16.719 align:start position:0%
driven you know profession medically and
 
01:57:19.709 --> 01:57:19.719 align:start position:0%
so I I have not encountered in in my 30
 
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
plus years of practice a situation where
 
01:57:26.669 --> 01:57:26.679 align:start position:0%
a clinician absolutely you know refused
 
01:57:31.390 --> 01:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
to um respond to a surrogate agent you
 
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
know when an
 
01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:35.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate family meeting Ethics
 
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
Committee and other you know uh
 
01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
potential Avenues suggested other forms
 
01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
for the the way to go what happens in
 
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
those scenarios is the clinician exits
 
01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
or refers to another clinician to take
 
01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
over care that's the standard of
 
01:57:54.030 --> 01:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
practice when there's an irreconcilable
 
01:57:56.589 --> 01:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
difference and and may I ask a followup
 
01:57:56.599 --> 01:57:57.629 align:start position:0%
difference and and may I ask a followup
Mr

01:57:57.629 --> 01:57:57.639 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
01:58:01.069 --> 01:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
chairman yes uh this would be a
 
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
hypothetical and it's it's based on my
 
01:58:06.189 --> 01:58:06.199 align:start position:0%
lived experience back in the days when
 
01:58:10.510 --> 01:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
we only had living Wheels but um I had
 
01:58:12.629 --> 01:58:12.639 align:start position:0%
an aunt who told me from the time I was
 
01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
18 until the time I was 35 that she
 
01:58:18.629 --> 01:58:18.639 align:start position:0%
never wanted to be taken to the hospital
 
01:58:20.830 --> 01:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
never wanted any treatment never wanted
 
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
to leave her home and she never wanted
 
01:58:26.270 --> 01:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
to be resuscitated or have any kind of
 
01:58:28.109 --> 01:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
invasive treatment
 
01:58:32.109 --> 01:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and when she experienced a
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
bowel blockage when I was 35 she asked
 
01:58:37.390 --> 01:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
to be driven to the
 
01:58:40.870 --> 01:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
hospital she consented knowingly and
 
01:58:43.709 --> 01:58:43.719 align:start position:0%
voluntarily to a series of Fairly
 
01:58:43.719 --> 01:58:45.189 align:start position:0%
voluntarily to a series of Fairly
invasive

01:58:45.189 --> 01:58:45.199 align:start position:0%
invasive
 
01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
tests and the question became and and as
 
01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:51.400 align:start position:0%
that was going on she became unable to
 
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
speak for herself so I got a phone call
 
01:58:58.669 --> 01:58:58.679 align:start position:0%
and I had a document that said she did
 
01:59:00.750 --> 01:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
not want any invasive procedures
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
whatsoever but I also had somebody who
 
01:59:08.229 --> 01:59:08.239 align:start position:0%
had just that week consented to three of
 
01:59:12.109 --> 01:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
them and who everybody I spoke to who
 
01:59:16.270 --> 01:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
knew her well said she is still fighting
 
01:59:20.030 --> 01:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
she really wants to fight uh what do we
 
01:59:25.950 --> 01:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
do now and I would have in in that case
 
01:59:28.229 --> 01:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
I was going to Advocate against what her
 
01:59:31.709 --> 01:59:31.719 align:start position:0%
living will said would this provision
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:39.669 --> 01:59:39.679 align:start position:0%
situation yes most definitely um it
 
01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
would so the living will uh presently as
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
proposed is a document of
 
01:59:48.239 --> 01:59:50.149 align:start position:0%
proposed is a document of
guidance

01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
01:59:54.069 --> 01:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
um it does not carry legal Authority the
 
01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
living will section unto itself but acts
 
02:00:00.430 --> 02:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
as guidance for the agent or
 
02:00:02.830 --> 02:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
surrogate again the agent or surrogate
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
must act in the best interest of the
 
02:00:06.629 --> 02:00:06.639 align:start position:0%
patient as best understood at the time
 
02:00:09.310 --> 02:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
but your example representative Weber is
 
02:00:11.709 --> 02:00:11.719 align:start position:0%
a good one and not an unusual one um and
 
02:00:14.589 --> 02:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
it goes in both directions you know um
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
people can't predict when they make
 
02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
decisions when they complete an advanced
 
02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:19.750 align:start position:0%
decisions when they complete an advanced
directive

02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
directive
 
02:00:22.030 --> 02:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
um their environment the people they're
 
02:00:23.350 --> 02:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
talking to the people that are
 
02:00:25.229 --> 02:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
counseling them and assisting them in
 
02:00:27.510 --> 02:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
the process you know are assessing a
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
situation at the time that can't
 
02:00:33.390 --> 02:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
adequately predict or know what the
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
future will hold in all sorts of Realms
 
02:00:38.229 --> 02:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
I mean there in just think of the
 
02:00:39.950 --> 02:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic and you know all that's changed
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
over the course of it in regards to
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
medical treatment there are incredibly
 
02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
unpredictable changes in events and
 
02:00:49.149 --> 02:00:49.159 align:start position:0%
environments that must allow us to act
 
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
act in the best interest of the patient
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
at the time as we can best understand it
 
02:00:55.669 --> 02:00:55.679 align:start position:0%
with the best guidance that we can have
 
02:00:57.790 --> 02:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
and this document we have tried to
 
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
simplify we have tried to make clear and
 
02:01:04.270 --> 02:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
we've tried to allow for that standard
 
02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
of Medical Practice to occur and for the
 
02:01:09.870 --> 02:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
document not to force treatments that
 
02:01:12.350 --> 02:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
would clearly be contrary to the best
 
02:01:15.629 --> 02:01:15.639 align:start position:0%
interests of the person if they were
 
02:01:17.950 --> 02:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
capable of telling us that at the time
 
02:01:20.109 --> 02:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
as we can best understand
 
02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and as a a former elder law
 
02:01:25.149 --> 02:01:25.159 align:start position:0%
attorney and former Ethics Committee
 
02:01:27.550 --> 02:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
panelist thank you all for your work on
 
02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:28.430 align:start position:0%
panelist thank you all for your work on
the

02:01:28.430 --> 02:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
bill and thank you Dr representative on
 
02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
this very narrow
 
02:01:37.550 --> 02:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
issue before we go back to our usually
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
scheduled program uh anybody with a hand
 
02:01:46.109 --> 02:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
up on this specific issue I think I see
 
02:01:49.390 --> 02:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant's hand up I do
 
02:01:52.669 --> 02:01:52.679 align:start position:0%
it sort of speaks to the issue um the
 
02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
issue I have as I listen to this
 
02:01:59.069 --> 02:01:59.079 align:start position:0%
conversation in the bill currently we
 
02:01:59.079 --> 02:01:59.830 align:start position:0%
conversation in the bill currently we
have

02:01:59.830 --> 02:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
inserted forms although the language
 
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
does say that could be
 
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
substantially equal to the form my
 
02:02:09.030 --> 02:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
concern is I listen to this
 
02:02:12.030 --> 02:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
conversation that this is very Dynamic
 
02:02:13.990 --> 02:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
um and forms probably will have to
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
change once the form goes into statute
 
02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to change the form
 
02:02:22.709 --> 02:02:22.719 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to have the forms
 
02:02:24.109 --> 02:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
developed by the Department of Health
 
02:02:26.350 --> 02:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
and Human Services through rulemaking
 
02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
therefore allowing through the agency
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
and rulemaking authority over time to
 
02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
change the form and modify it based upon
 
02:02:34.109 --> 02:02:34.119 align:start position:0%
this healthy conversation we're having
 
02:02:36.790 --> 02:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
today so we don't somehow inadvertently
 
02:02:38.830 --> 02:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
get ourselves into a pickle because we
 
02:02:40.629 --> 02:02:40.639 align:start position:0%
have a form in the statute that really
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
becomes difficult to change if we need
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:49.550 align:start position:0%
 
it

02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:02:50.950 --> 02:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
the way if you want to look at the forms
 
02:02:54.069 --> 02:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
that's on page 16 starts on
 
02:02:59.030 --> 02:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
line 33 and goes on um I just would like
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
to see it move towards a rulemaking
 
02:03:04.189 --> 02:03:04.199 align:start position:0%
Authority by the Department of Health
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
Human Services so that they would have
 
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
the ability to create a form uh in
 
02:03:11.069 --> 02:03:11.079 align:start position:0%
through Ru making and again the form
 
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
could be done through Ru making that is
 
02:03:15.550 --> 02:03:15.560 align:start position:0%
substantially like it but over time as
 
02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
things do evolve we're not locking
 
02:03:20.189 --> 02:03:20.199 align:start position:0%
ourselves into one type of form that may
 
02:03:21.709 --> 02:03:21.719 align:start position:0%
ultimately need to be changed and again
 
02:03:23.390 --> 02:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not an attorney but sometimes when
 
02:03:24.669 --> 02:03:24.679 align:start position:0%
you look at a form that goes into
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
statute and if you change it even though
 
02:03:28.830 --> 02:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
it does allow for it to be substantially
 
02:03:31.390 --> 02:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
changed I think by default people going
 
02:03:33.629 --> 02:03:33.639 align:start position:0%
to go to the form in the statute because
 
02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
it's legally I again I Look to people
 
02:03:37.870 --> 02:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
like perent web or somebody else is an
 
02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
attorney but I think they're going to
 
02:03:44.669 --> 02:03:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:47.229 --> 02:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
statute a wonderful question who's it
 
02:03:49.549 --> 02:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
addressed to
 
02:03:52.350 --> 02:03:52.360 align:start position:0%
address it to Peter
 
02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
MREs thank you representative Merchant
 
02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
for the question so we have operated
 
02:03:59.350 --> 02:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
with the form in statute currently so um
 
02:04:01.229 --> 02:04:01.239 align:start position:0%
that has been place where people have
 
02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
gone to reference the form that's what
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
we produce um off of so we're looking
 
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
just for these changes to be added to
 
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
the form now which again are trying to
 
02:04:13.310 --> 02:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
keep the um long-standing policy in
 
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
place and just provide for clarity so
 
02:04:17.430 --> 02:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
we're comfortable with the changes as
 
02:04:20.549 --> 02:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
they are um amending this statute um
 
02:04:21.870 --> 02:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
because we feel it captures what needs
 
02:04:24.750 --> 02:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
to be addressed at this time and this is
 
02:04:26.189 --> 02:04:26.199 align:start position:0%
Paula minan from the hospital
 
02:04:29.430 --> 02:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
Association we also um there are other
 
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
there are other statutes that have forms
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
in them um I'm thinking of next of kin
 
02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
um there's another I worked on that a
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
couple years ago um that that form is
 
02:04:42.310 --> 02:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
actually embedded into the law um there
 
02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
are other I mean we have done this in
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
other um statutes so we Act we actually
 
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
I think Ru making would add a comp a
 
02:04:54.669 --> 02:04:54.679 align:start position:0%
level of complexity that I'm not sure um
 
02:04:58.229 --> 02:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
would be helpful um and I would I would
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
actually um I mean not to do it right
 
02:05:03.189 --> 02:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
this second but when attorney Hilman um
 
02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
he works with this every day um in his
 
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
job as an elder law attorney so um I
 
02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
think he can address this as well um as
 
02:05:14.069 --> 02:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
to why it it works the way um it
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
currently is contemplated so um thank
 
02:05:17.679 --> 02:05:19.390 align:start position:0%
currently is contemplated so um thank
you

02:05:19.390 --> 02:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:05:21.790 --> 02:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh uh thank you Mr
 
02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
chairman this is for Dr Lawson here um
 
02:05:27.390 --> 02:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
as as someone who uh spent a great deal
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
of time in his career working with
 
02:05:32.350 --> 02:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
people who may have had a longstanding
 
02:05:34.350 --> 02:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
DNR order but may have had an acute
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
issue they wanted to take care of uh
 
02:05:38.750 --> 02:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
would I not be correct that the
 
02:05:40.229 --> 02:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
distinction you were trying to make
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
clear to the committee was the
 
02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
Physicians do not DNR order might be
 
02:05:48.069 --> 02:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
temporarily suspended uh for the purpose
 
02:05:50.229 --> 02:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
of taking care an acute issu such as for
 
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
instance a person in a long-term care
 
02:05:55.629 --> 02:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:59.229 --> 02:05:59.239 align:start position:0%
cataractes yes representative Marsha um
 
02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely there are numerous
 
02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
circumstances where DNR orders are
 
02:06:05.390 --> 02:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
rescinded uh inoperative is one of them
 
02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
so almost all institutions for example
 
02:06:11.629 --> 02:06:11.639 align:start position:0%
when a patient is going under
 
02:06:14.629 --> 02:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
anesthesia by policy of the institution
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
have a order to resend a DNR and there
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
are numerous circumstance es where
 
02:06:22.510 --> 02:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
people choose to have dnrs rescinded
 
02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
there are people who choose to be a DNR
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
community for instance but be a full
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
code while they're
 
02:06:33.790 --> 02:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
hospitalized where your chances of
 
02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:34.950 align:start position:0%
hospitalized where your chances of
success

02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
success
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
statistically are you know about three
 
02:06:40.030 --> 02:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
times four times as good while you're in
 
02:06:41.470 --> 02:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
the inpatient so there are numerous
 
02:06:44.549 --> 02:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
circumstances where patients will uh
 
02:06:47.310 --> 02:06:47.320 align:start position:0%
request resending or changing in DNR
 
02:06:49.709 --> 02:06:49.719 align:start position:0%
order it is a fluid
 
02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:57.310 --> 02:06:57.320 align:start position:0%
that well where are we Kar is hand
 
02:06:59.669 --> 02:06:59.679 align:start position:0%
what's that want Des question
 
02:07:02.510 --> 02:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative kerk thank you because I
 
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
had a question that was really very
 
02:07:06.910 --> 02:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
similar because a DNR because you have a
 
02:07:08.629 --> 02:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
hopeless situation is very different
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
than an interoperative arrest now you
 
02:07:14.069 --> 02:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
said the patient can resend in various
 
02:07:16.030 --> 02:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
times but it sounds like you're saying
 
02:07:18.149 --> 02:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
it automatically can occur usually most
 
02:07:21.390 --> 02:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
ins tions enter operatively um or that
 
02:07:23.470 --> 02:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
they have that choice of in a hospital
 
02:07:25.589 --> 02:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
versus out of Hospital arrest but I
 
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
didn't see that on the form of how they
 
02:07:29.669 --> 02:07:29.679 align:start position:0%
parse that out is that something that
 
02:07:32.189 --> 02:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
would be taken care of individually with
 
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
the uh practitioner uh between the
 
02:07:37.149 --> 02:07:37.159 align:start position:0%
provider and practitioner or how do they
 
02:07:39.430 --> 02:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
parse out those differences which are
 
02:07:42.109 --> 02:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
somewhat difficult I think for people to
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
understand the difference between a
 
02:07:46.229 --> 02:07:46.239 align:start position:0%
simple arrest interoperative and an
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
arrest when you were on your way out and
 
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
the act of dying as we is the phrase
 
02:07:52.549 --> 02:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
that is used here where it's a very
 
02:07:54.750 --> 02:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
different reason can you clarify how
 
02:07:56.189 --> 02:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
that would
 
02:07:58.589 --> 02:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
work yes I I take it that's addressed to
 
02:08:01.149 --> 02:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
me representative kerk yeah I pres yes I
 
02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
think I think Dr Lawson that' be best to
 
02:08:06.149 --> 02:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
you yeah so um absolutely so there are
 
02:08:09.069 --> 02:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
situations like you um discuss where it
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
is by policy and automatically done and
 
02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
then there are situations where it is an
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
agreement between the patient Andor
 
02:08:20.709 --> 02:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
their surrogate or agent and the
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
clinician involved and it it is a fluid
 
02:08:27.750 --> 02:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
process the it's it's too unfortunately
 
02:08:29.229 --> 02:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
too complicated and there are too many
 
02:08:31.229 --> 02:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
different situations to try to stipulate
 
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
it in law and I'll give you an example
 
02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
of a analgous situation and that is a
 
02:08:39.990 --> 02:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
person's capacity so you know by law you
 
02:08:42.870 --> 02:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
either have capacity or you don't but in
 
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
reality from a medical sense you can
 
02:08:48.549 --> 02:08:48.559 align:start position:0%
have capacity to make certain decisions
 
02:08:51.790 --> 02:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
ISS but not have capacity to make other
 
02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
more complex decisions and your capacity
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
can wax and WS so as people with for
 
02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
instance mild to moderate dementia uh
 
02:09:03.950 --> 02:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
you know Sundown using the the street
 
02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
term or or get more Delirious in the
 
02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
evening they could have capacity in the
 
02:09:10.510 --> 02:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
morning and not have capacity in the
 
02:09:13.109 --> 02:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
evening so these things are fluid and
 
02:09:16.270 --> 02:09:16.280 align:start position:0%
like most medical things are complicated
 
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
vary over time and
 
02:09:20.990 --> 02:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
cannot be
 
02:09:25.589 --> 02:09:25.599 align:start position:0%
legally you know parsed out um without
 
02:09:31.589 --> 02:09:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:35.629 --> 02:09:35.639 align:start position:0%
experience I do not see anyone's hand up
 
02:09:37.990 --> 02:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
but we'll give one last call to
 
02:09:41.069 --> 02:09:41.079 align:start position:0%
discussing DNR before we go back to how
 
02:09:43.950 --> 02:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
we normally do things is that a hand up
 
02:09:45.510 --> 02:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
or just a scratch okay that was a
 
02:09:48.830 --> 02:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
scratch oh representative day thank you
 
02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and uh thank you all for
 
02:09:53.350 --> 02:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question because I'm not sure
 
02:09:56.950 --> 02:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
who to direct it at uh all of this is
 
02:10:00.189 --> 02:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
new to me so I apologize for the novess
 
02:10:04.109 --> 02:10:04.119 align:start position:0%
of my question where where is it spelled
 
02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
out what ought I say does it spell out
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
that the medical provider whatever
 
02:10:14.109 --> 02:10:14.119 align:start position:0%
terminology want to use for the medical
 
02:10:16.549 --> 02:10:16.559 align:start position:0%
person in charge of a
 
02:10:20.589 --> 02:10:20.599 align:start position:0%
patient where is this said in stone that
 
02:10:23.629 --> 02:10:23.639 align:start position:0%
the medical provider has the final
 
02:10:28.270 --> 02:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
utmost say in interpreting the DNR
 
02:10:36.669 --> 02:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:39.669 --> 02:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
patient that was it was
 
02:10:42.549 --> 02:10:42.559 align:start position:0%
cited in some of the
 
02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:47.239 --> 02:10:53.669 align:start position:0%
 
now

02:10:53.669 --> 02:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative Weber do you wish to
 
02:10:58.149 --> 02:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
address that I saw your your light
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
on no me um if if you want me to an I'll
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
be glad to take a stab at it it's
 
02:11:12.910 --> 02:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
unusual um saw was the Box around you
 
02:11:15.069 --> 02:11:15.079 align:start position:0%
was lit which usually means somebody
 
02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
want is trying to speak so that's why
 
02:11:19.390 --> 02:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
called on
 
02:11:24.350 --> 02:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
someone I would be happy to answer
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
it uh the the DNR order as um the
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
attorney spoke is a medical order
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
written by a practitioner the word in
 
02:11:42.910 --> 02:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
the law is practitioner and so the the
 
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
practitioner writes the order like
 
02:11:47.870 --> 02:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
that's actually what happens so nobody
 
02:11:49.669 --> 02:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
else can write an order an agent can't
 
02:11:52.589 --> 02:11:52.599 align:start position:0%
write an order in a medical record um
 
02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
only a practitioner can and that so
 
02:11:59.390 --> 02:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
that's I mean it's it's as simple as
 
02:12:01.589 --> 02:12:01.599 align:start position:0%
that from my perspective maybe Ben or
 
02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
one of the attorneys would like to
 
02:12:09.149 --> 02:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:11.709 --> 02:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
complexity any of the
 
02:12:15.229 --> 02:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
attorneys able to answer representative
 
02:12:15.239 --> 02:12:17.069 align:start position:0%
attorneys able to answer representative
Gay's

02:12:17.069 --> 02:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
Gay's
 
02:12:17.079 --> 02:12:21.030 align:start position:0%
Gay's
question

02:12:21.030 --> 02:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:25.790 --> 02:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:35.109 --> 02:12:35.119 align:start position:0%
ahead I'm sorry I don't know if it was
 
02:12:37.229 --> 02:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
directed at me or at attorney a
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I was just I guess
 
02:12:40.510 --> 02:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
I would just add that I I don't have
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
anything to add to what attorney lawon
 
02:12:43.870 --> 02:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
said in terms of the distinction between
 
02:12:46.709 --> 02:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
the agent's ability to make a decision
 
02:12:48.669 --> 02:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
and what needs to be embodied in order
 
02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
Physician yes thank you for taking my
 
02:12:59.030 --> 02:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
additional question which is how exactly
 
02:13:02.470 --> 02:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
do you go what is the process to go from
 
02:13:06.310 --> 02:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
a patient's DNR which is let's say it's
 
02:13:11.709 --> 02:13:11.719 align:start position:0%
in it's supported by uh its agent or uh
 
02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
whatever the right word is for the
 
02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
person speaking for the person who wrote
 
02:13:18.510 --> 02:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
the DML how do you go from a p patient's
 
02:13:21.549 --> 02:13:21.559 align:start position:0%
DNR to a medical
 
02:13:26.510 --> 02:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
DNR what what drives the the provider's
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
decision to write the DNR do you have to
 
02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
we're always told we have to bring those
 
02:13:35.830 --> 02:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
orders with to every doctor when I take
 
02:13:38.549 --> 02:13:38.559 align:start position:0%
my mother to many different doctors we
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
had to make sure that each of them was
 
02:13:45.030 --> 02:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
aware of what her uh documents were but
 
02:13:48.390 --> 02:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
how do you transfer that into the ual
 
02:13:52.830 --> 02:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
medical order at what time is that
 
02:13:56.549 --> 02:13:56.559 align:start position:0%
transferred how does this happen thank
 
02:13:58.830 --> 02:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
you I can answer that I think I'm
 
02:14:00.990 --> 02:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
probably in the best position Dr Lawson
 
02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
here again um the so this is a common uh
 
02:14:08.790 --> 02:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
issue many people
 
02:14:12.589 --> 02:14:12.599 align:start position:0%
misconstrue an advanced directive for a
 
02:14:14.950 --> 02:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
medical order and advanced directives
 
02:14:17.310 --> 02:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
are not MediCal orders the advanced
 
02:14:19.910 --> 02:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
directive is purely a document that
 
02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:21.510 align:start position:0%
directive is purely a document that
states

02:14:21.510 --> 02:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:14:24.510 --> 02:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
wishes for the future and an advanced
 
02:14:27.870 --> 02:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
directive does not come into
 
02:14:31.470 --> 02:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
effect until the patient has been
 
02:14:34.990 --> 02:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
documented to have lost capacity and to
 
02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
fulfill any of the preset components of
 
02:14:40.390 --> 02:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
the advanced directive so an advanced
 
02:14:43.069 --> 02:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
directive itself is not a medical order
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
under any
 
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances so you could say anything
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
in an advanced directive and if you
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
suddenly died at home emergency
 
02:14:54.149 --> 02:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
Personnel are obligated to initiate CPR
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
irrespective of what's written in your
 
02:14:58.990 --> 02:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
Advanced Directive because it is not in
 
02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
effect because you have not been
 
02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
documented by a medical practitioner to
 
02:15:05.109 --> 02:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
have lost capacity so that's the first
 
02:15:06.430 --> 02:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
thing an advanced directive is a
 
02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
directive for the future it is not a
 
02:15:11.270 --> 02:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
medical order the medical order is the
 
02:15:16.430 --> 02:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
DNR or or pul form and those puls forms
 
02:15:20.830 --> 02:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
or DN R forms the pink or yellow forms
 
02:15:23.709 --> 02:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
are completed by the practitioner at the
 
02:15:28.750 --> 02:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
request of the patient or their agent or
 
02:15:30.510 --> 02:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
surrogate um depending on the
 
02:15:33.229 --> 02:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
circumstance or advised by the
 
02:15:37.510 --> 02:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
practitioner um so the process has to be
 
02:15:41.189 --> 02:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
a meeting um an appointment or a meeting
 
02:15:44.030 --> 02:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
or an in hospital consultation or or
 
02:15:46.910 --> 02:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
wherever the venue is uh to have an
 
02:15:48.709 --> 02:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate discussion around the
 
02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
benefits and risks associated with such
 
02:15:54.109 --> 02:15:54.119 align:start position:0%
an order and then the order actually
 
02:15:57.229 --> 02:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
being written and the accepted orders in
 
02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire include the
 
02:16:04.549 --> 02:16:04.559 align:start position:0%
pink portable DNR assuming SB 74 moves
 
02:16:06.990 --> 02:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
forward it would include the yellow
 
02:16:10.629 --> 02:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
pulst form which has a DNR and then any
 
02:16:12.390 --> 02:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
order within an
 
02:16:14.750 --> 02:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
institution that is consistent with the
 
02:16:16.549 --> 02:16:16.559 align:start position:0%
policies and practices of the
 
02:16:19.310 --> 02:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
institution and and those are the only
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
accepted medical orders so it is a the
 
02:16:24.310 --> 02:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
process by which an advanced directive
 
02:16:25.709 --> 02:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
which I think you're talking about
 
02:16:29.350 --> 02:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
representative moving to a DNR
 
02:16:32.429 --> 02:16:32.439 align:start position:0%
order is a specific interaction between
 
02:16:34.709 --> 02:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
a practitioner and a patient Andor their
 
02:16:38.349 --> 02:16:38.359 align:start position:0%
family and and or surrogate or agent um
 
02:16:39.830 --> 02:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
where that order is
 
02:16:42.429 --> 02:16:42.439 align:start position:0%
written it's really really common
 
02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
misconception about probably 50% of more
 
02:16:46.750 --> 02:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
of the patients who come to see me in
 
02:16:48.790 --> 02:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
paliative care consult consultation have
 
02:16:50.469 --> 02:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
an advanced directive that's all they
 
02:16:52.429 --> 02:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
have and they think they have an A DNR
 
02:16:54.910 --> 02:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
order and they don't and they will
 
02:16:54.920 --> 02:16:56.270 align:start position:0%
order and they don't and they will
receive

02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
receive
 
02:16:59.629 --> 02:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
CPR when EMS is called when 911 is
 
02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
called from home irrespective of what
 
02:17:04.309 --> 02:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
that advanced directive say says it's a
 
02:17:06.270 --> 02:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
good I appreciate you bringing up the
 
02:17:07.709 --> 02:17:07.719 align:start position:0%
point because hopefully it's educating
 
02:17:10.110 --> 02:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
quite a few people um there what what
 
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
they say in their advance directive is
 
02:17:13.830 --> 02:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
not a medical order until it has been
 
02:17:16.270 --> 02:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
made into a medical
 
02:17:19.990 --> 02:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
order so very helpful thank you um I
 
02:17:22.389 --> 02:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
think I'd like to attempt to go back to
 
02:17:24.830 --> 02:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
the normal way of doing things and call
 
02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
on a few other people who haven't spoken
 
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
yet coming back to the original uh group
 
02:17:32.830 --> 02:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
that we brought in on one specific thing
 
02:17:34.589 --> 02:17:34.599 align:start position:0%
with that the chair would like to
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
recognize Robert Dunn who was part of
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
this group and represents the Roman
 
02:17:46.589 --> 02:17:46.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:46.599 --> 02:18:03.830 align:start position:0%
 
Hampshire

02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:06.830 --> 02:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
so welcome to Mr
 
02:18:10.270 --> 02:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
Don uh good morning Mr chair members of
 
02:18:10.280 --> 02:18:10.950 align:start position:0%
Don uh good morning Mr chair members of
the

02:18:10.950 --> 02:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:18:14.030 --> 02:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh thank you for uh the
 
02:18:17.190 --> 02:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to testify I'm blob dun
 
02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
theor dor of public policy for the Roman
 
02:18:22.469 --> 02:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
Catholic dasis of Manchester and I'm
 
02:18:26.070 --> 02:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
speaking today in support of SB
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
74 um I won't go into too much detail
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
because I know there's a lot of folks
 
02:18:36.549 --> 02:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
that um are going to um go uh over the
 
02:18:40.110 --> 02:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
various provisions of the bill uh uh
 
02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
with much more of a fine tooth comb um
 
02:18:44.349 --> 02:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make a couple of
 
02:18:48.429 --> 02:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
comments here at the outset um first off
 
02:18:51.549 --> 02:18:51.559 align:start position:0%
our views on end of Life Care start with
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
the fundamental conviction that each
 
02:18:58.150 --> 02:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
human being was created in God's image
 
02:19:01.549 --> 02:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
and likeness and that therefore every
 
02:19:05.230 --> 02:19:05.240 align:start position:0%
person at every moment of life has a
 
02:19:07.669 --> 02:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
Priceless dignity that can never be
 
02:19:10.750 --> 02:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
diminished or taken away even when a
 
02:19:13.669 --> 02:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
person is in the extremities of illness
 
02:19:15.270 --> 02:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
or death
 
02:19:18.309 --> 02:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
itself um and so from Catholic
 
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
perspective we believe that this calls
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
us to avoid the opposite extremes of the
 
02:19:26.070 --> 02:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
deliberate hastening of death on the one
 
02:19:28.870 --> 02:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
hand and the use of treatment that under
 
02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
the circumstances doesn't have a
 
02:19:33.469 --> 02:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
reasonable hope of benefit or
 
02:19:36.389 --> 02:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
constitutes an excessive burden on the
 
02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
other and U so the
 
02:19:42.990 --> 02:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
dasis has actually published a booklet
 
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
that's called three beliefs that
 
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
explains Catholic views on end of life
 
02:19:50.790 --> 02:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
care and that tries to assist New
 
02:19:53.750 --> 02:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Catholics in setting up their
 
02:19:56.190 --> 02:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
durable Powers of Attorney for health
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
care and based on that experience we
 
02:20:03.429 --> 02:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
think that SB 74 makes improvements to
 
02:20:05.469 --> 02:20:05.479 align:start position:0%
the advanced directive law that's in
 
02:20:05.479 --> 02:20:06.469 align:start position:0%
the advanced directive law that's in
place

02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:20:08.990 --> 02:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
today um and I know you're going to hear
 
02:20:11.950 --> 02:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
about these in more detail um I'd
 
02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
highlight um things I think that you'll
 
02:20:17.830 --> 02:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
hear about um about how the bill clarifi
 
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
that uh end of life treatment Provisions
 
02:20:22.630 --> 02:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
in an advanced directive are connected
 
02:20:25.590 --> 02:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
to the person having an advanced life
 
02:20:28.670 --> 02:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
limiting um essentially what we would
 
02:20:30.990 --> 02:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
probably colloquially refer to as a
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
terminal illness and it and it
 
02:20:36.670 --> 02:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
importantly lays out how a balancing of
 
02:20:39.510 --> 02:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
burdens and benefits is involved in the
 
02:20:41.950 --> 02:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
making of decisions regarding end of
 
02:20:45.349 --> 02:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
Life Care um the provisions that you've
 
02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
been uh hearing about already ready that
 
02:20:52.990 --> 02:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
um kind of helped to make it uh the case
 
02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
that uh decisions are being made on an
 
02:21:00.389 --> 02:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
updated basis on the most recent
 
02:21:03.750 --> 02:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
information that folks have are also
 
02:21:08.230 --> 02:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
notable um and the bill clarifies that
 
02:21:11.910 --> 02:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
those outof state orders and posts are
 
02:21:14.270 --> 02:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
only effective in New Hampshire to the
 
02:21:16.710 --> 02:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
degree that they substantively conform
 
02:21:19.830 --> 02:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire law and finally I just
 
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
want to point out very significantly
 
02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
that SB 74 once again reiterates that
 
02:21:30.030 --> 02:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
our law doesn't condone or legalize
 
02:21:32.349 --> 02:21:32.359 align:start position:0%
physician assisted
 
02:21:35.590 --> 02:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
suicide now um I do want to note that
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
there are certain aspects of the current
 
02:21:40.710 --> 02:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
law specifically Provisions that relate
 
02:21:42.990 --> 02:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
to permanent unconsciousness and
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
medically administered nutrition and
 
02:21:47.830 --> 02:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
hydration which we have opposed over the
 
02:21:50.030 --> 02:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
years because these Provisions don't
 
02:21:52.270 --> 02:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
Accord with our views on what should be
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
considered basic obligations of care and
 
02:21:58.030 --> 02:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
because those Provisions are largely
 
02:22:00.590 --> 02:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
unchanged by Senate Bill
 
02:22:03.550 --> 02:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
74 I do want to emphasize that in
 
02:22:06.190 --> 02:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
supporting Senate Bill 74 we're not
 
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
altering our position on those
 
02:22:11.349 --> 02:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
Provisions but as I said um we think
 
02:22:13.309 --> 02:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
that the version of the advanced
 
02:22:15.469 --> 02:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
directive law that would be in effect
 
02:22:18.550 --> 02:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
after the passage of Senate bill 74
 
02:22:20.790 --> 02:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
would be an improvement over the version
 
02:22:23.070 --> 02:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
that's in effect today and that's why
 
02:22:26.270 --> 02:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
we're supporting the bill uh so thank
 
02:22:29.150 --> 02:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
you for your consideration of our views
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll close any questions
 
02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
committee well thank you sir for all
 
02:22:43.510 --> 02:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
your hard work on this group and for
 
02:22:47.150 --> 02:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
your bringing the uh um position of the
 
02:22:48.389 --> 02:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
Roman Catholic
 
02:22:51.230 --> 02:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
dasis the chair would now like to call
 
02:22:52.910 --> 02:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
we have a few people signed up in
 
02:22:55.510 --> 02:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
opposition and I want to get to them
 
02:22:57.870 --> 02:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
before we go any further I I believe
 
02:23:00.990 --> 02:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
former representative Kathleen
 
02:23:15.389 --> 02:23:15.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:17.950 --> 02:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
testify and anyone want to testify could
 
02:23:19.630 --> 02:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand to bring you to
 
02:23:24.630 --> 02:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:27.910 --> 02:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
list is Kathleen soua in the meeting I'm
 
02:23:30.429 --> 02:23:30.439 align:start position:0%
not seeing her on the attendees list
 
02:23:35.469 --> 02:23:35.479 align:start position:0%
okay then representative Erica Leon from
 
02:23:37.870 --> 02:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
Barry um thank you Mr chair and
 
02:23:39.830 --> 02:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee for
 
02:23:41.910 --> 02:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
the record I am representative Erica
 
02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
Leon of Derry I stand in strong
 
02:23:46.469 --> 02:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill as it turns a
 
02:23:48.309 --> 02:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
weighty decision ision into an overly
 
02:23:48.319 --> 02:23:49.230 align:start position:0%
weighty decision ision into an overly
simple

02:23:49.230 --> 02:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
simple
 
02:23:51.190 --> 02:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
form what looks like a simple
 
02:23:53.309 --> 02:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
designation of medical decision maker
 
02:23:55.190 --> 02:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
actually flips current policy on its
 
02:23:57.630 --> 02:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
head right now it's easy to say that
 
02:23:59.349 --> 02:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
only your designated agent can make
 
02:24:01.389 --> 02:24:01.399 align:start position:0%
these choices by filling out only part
 
02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
one and not part two of the current form
 
02:24:06.349 --> 02:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
with this bill there is no clear way to
 
02:24:08.429 --> 02:24:08.439 align:start position:0%
do this and no language to protect that
 
02:24:11.309 --> 02:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
as a specific declaration that is a huge
 
02:24:13.990 --> 02:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
problem if you pass this will we need a
 
02:24:16.030 --> 02:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
bereaved family members to sue to see
 
02:24:18.269 --> 02:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
how it plays out in court
 
02:24:19.990 --> 02:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
this morning I emailed my the committee
 
02:24:21.790 --> 02:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
my concerns in this bill in bullet point
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
format I have many serious concerns
 
02:24:25.870 --> 02:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
about how this bill shifts consent from
 
02:24:27.950 --> 02:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
opt-in to opt out on experimental
 
02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
therapies and honoring State statements
 
02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
of incapacitated patients on how it
 
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
reduces the rights of practitioners to
 
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
follow their conscience on how it Blends
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's disease with an irreversible
 
02:24:41.150 --> 02:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
coma and how it removes family beyond
 
02:24:43.070 --> 02:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
the agent or surgant from care planning
 
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
decisions when they are
 
02:24:46.510 --> 02:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
incapacitated perhaps even more
 
02:24:48.429 --> 02:24:48.439 align:start position:0%
terrifying in right now if a patient
 
02:24:50.190 --> 02:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
wants their agent or practitioner to
 
02:24:51.750 --> 02:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
ignore what they say when they are
 
02:24:54.030 --> 02:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
incapacitated they need to specifically
 
02:24:56.590 --> 02:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
opt in by writing that on the
 
02:24:59.630 --> 02:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
form if you sign the forms as proposed
 
02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:00.309 align:start position:0%
form if you sign the forms as proposed
in

02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:25:03.150 --> 02:25:03.160 align:start position:0%
s74 your doctor and your agent can
 
02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
ignore your please for care or your
 
02:25:07.269 --> 02:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
refusal of treatment a patient with
 
02:25:09.230 --> 02:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's can be ignored if they just
 
02:25:11.349 --> 02:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
form this sign the form as written on S
 
02:25:11.359 --> 02:25:13.150 align:start position:0%
form this sign the form as written on S
SP

02:25:13.150 --> 02:25:13.160 align:start position:0%
SP
 
02:25:15.950 --> 02:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
74 I understand just how wey it is to
 
02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
stop fighting death as my father's
 
02:25:19.550 --> 02:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
Advanced Directive allowed the family to
 
02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
make the decision and then stay with
 
02:25:23.710 --> 02:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
them for his final moments final days
 
02:25:25.309 --> 02:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
where we could say those necessary
 
02:25:27.590 --> 02:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
things and to literally hear him say I
 
02:25:30.590 --> 02:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
love you with his dying breath this Bill
 
02:25:32.910 --> 02:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
had it applied to us would have let the
 
02:25:35.389 --> 02:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
hospital not treat his sepsis and denied
 
02:25:38.030 --> 02:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
that closure to all of us especially
 
02:25:40.110 --> 02:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
closure to him as it had been over two
 
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
decades for the family that was in that
 
02:25:43.990 --> 02:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
room to be
 
02:25:47.230 --> 02:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
together so this bill this bill makes
 
02:25:50.269 --> 02:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
the form so simple and uncomplicated
 
02:25:52.309 --> 02:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
that an average patient won't understand
 
02:25:54.830 --> 02:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
just how much autonomy they give up the
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
form looks like any other rote form that
 
02:25:56.800 --> 02:25:58.630 align:start position:0%
form looks like any other rote form that
patients

02:25:58.630 --> 02:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
signed with some of the changes it
 
02:26:02.870 --> 02:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
actually allows a doctor you've never
 
02:26:05.070 --> 02:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
met to sterilize you if you're in a coma
 
02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
from an accident and it should not be
 
02:26:09.670 --> 02:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
that easy to sign away those rights I
 
02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
urge you to kill this bill by voting in
 
02:26:13.750 --> 02:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate please just pull
 
02:26:16.309 --> 02:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
a plug uh thank you and I will take
 
02:26:16.319 --> 02:26:17.710 align:start position:0%
a plug uh thank you and I will take
questions

02:26:17.710 --> 02:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:26:22.030 --> 02:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
Leon uh representative
 
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
gay thank you thank you
 
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Leon could you
 
02:26:38.110 --> 02:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
again cite some of the points per line
 
02:26:40.830 --> 02:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh that you are saying would have
 
02:26:43.349 --> 02:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
interfered with your family being with
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
your father or the sterilization
 
02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
something right because this is rather
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
detailed it would be very helpful since
 
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
you have cited them thank you
 
02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative gay I I do understand
 
02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
that I I dropped a lot of things on you
 
02:27:01.269 --> 02:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
so it's good to back these up if you go
 
02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
to page six um and start at line 29 this
 
02:27:09.030 --> 02:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
is where it changes the capacity and the
 
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
ability to refuse treatment or to ask
 
02:27:14.429 --> 02:27:14.439 align:start position:0%
for treatment right now the part that's
 
02:27:16.349 --> 02:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
struck out starting at line 36 and
 
02:27:19.230 --> 02:27:19.240 align:start position:0%
Contin to page seven it requires that
 
02:27:22.590 --> 02:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
the principal it says that um treatment
 
02:27:24.309 --> 02:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
may not be given or withheld from the
 
02:27:26.429 --> 02:27:26.439 align:start position:0%
principal over the principal's objection
 
02:27:27.790 --> 02:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
unless the principal's Advanced
 
02:27:29.269 --> 02:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
Direction includes the following
 
02:27:31.830 --> 02:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
statement initialed by the principal
 
02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
even if I am incapacitated and I object
 
02:27:36.190 --> 02:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
to treatment treatment may be given to
 
02:27:40.110 --> 02:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
me against my objection the new language
 
02:27:43.790 --> 02:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
says that the the agent or surrogate
 
02:27:46.269 --> 02:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
acting on the principal's behalf um
 
02:27:48.030 --> 02:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
consent to treatment or withholding of
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
treatment from the principal even over
 
02:27:52.950 --> 02:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
the principal's objection unless the
 
02:27:54.670 --> 02:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
durable power of attorney for healthcare
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
provides otherwise that puts the onus on
 
02:27:59.309 --> 02:27:59.319 align:start position:0%
somebody who is filling out what will be
 
02:28:01.349 --> 02:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
a two-page sheet that looks like it's
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
just naming the person to make those
 
02:28:05.190 --> 02:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
choices to know that that's within the
 
02:28:06.990 --> 02:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
law especially because that's not even
 
02:28:08.590 --> 02:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
within the disclosure
 
02:28:11.630 --> 02:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
statement um if you'd like me um
 
02:28:13.389 --> 02:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
representative gay would you like me to
 
02:28:16.150 --> 02:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
look for to pull up another one of those
 
02:28:18.469 --> 02:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
like the St ization that one's on page 8
 
02:28:18.479 --> 02:28:20.030 align:start position:0%
like the St ization that one's on page 8
line

02:28:20.030 --> 02:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:28:25.870 --> 02:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
12 so right now it in um page 8 line 12
 
02:28:28.630 --> 02:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
it still prevents them the agent from
 
02:28:30.349 --> 02:28:30.359 align:start position:0%
consenting to psychosurgery or
 
02:28:33.630 --> 02:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
electroconvulsive shock therapy and
 
02:28:35.269 --> 02:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
instead of just striking out an
 
02:28:37.190 --> 02:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
experimental treatment of any kind it
 
02:28:39.590 --> 02:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
also Strikes Out sterilization and
 
02:28:41.830 --> 02:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
that's in direct conflict with the
 
02:28:44.349 --> 02:28:44.359 align:start position:0%
disclosure form that is provided for in
 
02:28:47.630 --> 02:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
the statute um so the disclosure form is
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
would be in conflict with the underlying
 
02:28:52.070 --> 02:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
RSA um with the fact that sterilization
 
02:28:54.510 --> 02:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
is struck
 
02:28:58.150 --> 02:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
out and um the
 
02:29:00.910 --> 02:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
in and um the part that would have made
 
02:29:03.630 --> 02:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
that change for my father is right now
 
02:29:06.190 --> 02:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
is right now you have to when you fill
 
02:29:07.830 --> 02:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
out the Advanced healthc Care directive
 
02:29:09.710 --> 02:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
form there's the two sections there's
 
02:29:11.469 --> 02:29:11.479 align:start position:0%
the durable power power of attorney for
 
02:29:13.230 --> 02:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
healthcare and then there's a living
 
02:29:15.389 --> 02:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
will and in New Hampshire statute the
 
02:29:16.950 --> 02:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
way that it's written now the living
 
02:29:20.429 --> 02:29:20.439 align:start position:0%
will just gives that direction for a
 
02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
physician a physician um uh assistant or
 
02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
an advanced practice nurse to make those
 
02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
decisions about incapacity and then
 
02:29:32.230 --> 02:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
making those end of life decisions so if
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
you don't want to have a doctor that you
 
02:29:37.309 --> 02:29:37.319 align:start position:0%
may not have ever met before make those
 
02:29:40.830 --> 02:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
choices for you then you just do not
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
sign that part and you are not giving
 
02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
those rights
 
02:29:46.230 --> 02:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
away that is not something that's
 
02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
providing Ed for in this bill in the new
 
02:29:51.870 --> 02:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
statute as amended by SP
 
02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
74 I honestly would have to hire a
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
lawyer to know how to put that into my
 
02:29:58.429 --> 02:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
directive because I don't want to give
 
02:30:00.830 --> 02:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
away that autonomy I would rather be in
 
02:30:02.790 --> 02:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
limbo until they can find somebody to
 
02:30:05.670 --> 02:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
make that choice for me than to allow a
 
02:30:08.590 --> 02:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
doctor well well-meaning as they may be
 
02:30:10.309 --> 02:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
to decide that I shouldn't have that
 
02:30:13.150 --> 02:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
cont that sustaining
 
02:30:17.910 --> 02:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
care follow up oh would you be so kind
 
02:30:21.790 --> 02:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
as to put these concerns into writing to
 
02:30:24.630 --> 02:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
send us since it is
 
02:30:27.469 --> 02:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
complex um thank you representative I
 
02:30:29.070 --> 02:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
actually I'm sure you've had a huge
 
02:30:31.630 --> 02:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
number of emails about this bill I sent
 
02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
one to you all this morning from my
 
02:30:35.630 --> 02:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
legislative email that does have the
 
02:30:37.429 --> 02:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
bullet points of the lines I do
 
02:30:39.750 --> 02:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
apologize the one of them I forgot to
 
02:30:42.190 --> 02:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
have the page reference so in the one
 
02:30:44.150 --> 02:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
where it's the language striking out um
 
02:30:45.670 --> 02:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
the right of a principal to reserve
 
02:30:47.550 --> 02:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
these end of life decisions to only
 
02:30:51.429 --> 02:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
their agent that's on page 11 line 16-34
 
02:30:53.469 --> 02:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
I had uh forgotten to have that page as
 
02:30:56.469 --> 02:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:59.070 --> 02:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
up thank you very
 
02:31:01.870 --> 02:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
much any other questions for
 
02:31:01.880 --> 02:31:08.670 align:start position:0%
much any other questions for
representative

02:31:08.670 --> 02:31:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:12.910 --> 02:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
Leon I do not see any hands except for
 
02:31:16.030 --> 02:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
the hand of Representative kushman thank
 
02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you representative
 
02:31:24.070 --> 02:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
um can you speak to your concerns
 
02:31:27.910 --> 02:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
about um the incapacity blending uh
 
02:31:29.710 --> 02:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
between you know say someone who has
 
02:31:34.389 --> 02:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's disease um with imminent
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
death um thank you representative yes
 
02:31:39.110 --> 02:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
02:31:42.389 --> 02:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
this the biggest concern here is the
 
02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
ability to override somebody's um the
 
02:31:47.309 --> 02:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
one that we look to for about overriding
 
02:31:48.910 --> 02:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
their wishes and their expressed
 
02:31:51.349 --> 02:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
interests because if somebody is in a
 
02:31:53.670 --> 02:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
coma or something else like that right
 
02:31:56.510 --> 02:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of life and they're Delirious
 
02:31:59.230 --> 02:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
that's one level of incapacity that it
 
02:32:00.590 --> 02:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
that would make
 
02:32:03.510 --> 02:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
sense I could I could see a time where
 
02:32:05.309 --> 02:32:05.319 align:start position:0%
you would ignore what somebody's saying
 
02:32:06.950 --> 02:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
because they might be talking about all
 
02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
sorts of other nonsensical things and a
 
02:32:12.150 --> 02:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
provider might want to override those
 
02:32:14.469 --> 02:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
decisions because they clearly don't
 
02:32:17.790 --> 02:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
have much of a grasp of reality
 
02:32:20.349 --> 02:32:20.359 align:start position:0%
you ALS right now with incapacity
 
02:32:22.550 --> 02:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
there's not any sort of separation from
 
02:32:25.190 --> 02:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
ma major neurocognitive disorders like
 
02:32:27.750 --> 02:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's um there are other states
 
02:32:29.670 --> 02:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
that do have a provision for major
 
02:32:31.590 --> 02:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
neurocognitive disorders where there can
 
02:32:33.510 --> 02:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
be treatment that's given against the
 
02:32:36.389 --> 02:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
patient's will either for um being put
 
02:32:39.349 --> 02:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
into a locked memory facility for being
 
02:32:41.110 --> 02:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
given medications that they don't
 
02:32:43.309 --> 02:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise consent to but that's not
 
02:32:45.389 --> 02:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
within the same blanket statement like
 
02:32:47.469 --> 02:32:47.479 align:start position:0%
we are trying to put into law here
 
02:32:48.870 --> 02:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
that's something that's well considered
 
02:32:51.830 --> 02:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
for these longstanding incapacities and
 
02:32:53.389 --> 02:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
there's there's just not much treatment
 
02:32:56.389 --> 02:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
of that here um we we're not respecting
 
02:32:58.309 --> 02:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
the difference between an Alzheimer's
 
02:33:01.429 --> 02:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
patient and somebody who's who's just on
 
02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:02.960 align:start position:0%

02:33:07.349 --> 02:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
death thank you thank you any further

see nothing I have my hand up I'm sorry
 
02:34:24.590 --> 02:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead I I'm not sure who this
 
02:34:26.030 --> 02:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
would be most appropriate for but there
 
02:34:27.790 --> 02:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
was just one spot that I was a little
 
02:34:29.990 --> 02:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
bit confused and just wanted explanation
 
02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:31.230 align:start position:0%
bit confused and just wanted explanation
page

02:34:31.230 --> 02:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:34:34.389 --> 02:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
26 lines 20 to
 
02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
23 if you could just clarify what that
 
02:34:40.230 --> 02:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
means and why it's there I just was a
 
02:34:43.550 --> 02:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:45.590 --> 02:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
uncertain I mean it sounds like it gives
 
02:34:48.190 --> 02:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
permission for a person to not treat
 
02:34:50.070 --> 02:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
sorry practitioner to choose to not
 
02:34:53.309 --> 02:34:53.319 align:start position:0%
treat a patient is that all it's
 
02:34:55.670 --> 02:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
doing I can ask you to reference those
 
02:34:58.269 --> 02:34:58.279 align:start position:0%
lines once more for me it's page 26
 
02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:07.510 --> 02:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:10.670 --> 02:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
you it appears that it just says if that
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
the practitioner is not obligated to
 
02:35:15.550 --> 02:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
treat someone who lacks decision-making
 
02:35:18.990 --> 02:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
capacity and I'm curious why that's
 
02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:27.550 align:start position:0%
capacity and I'm curious why that's
[Music]

02:35:27.550 --> 02:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:30.349 --> 02:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
there yeah so that um piece is part of
 
02:35:32.670 --> 02:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
current law um so we're not looking to
 
02:35:35.110 --> 02:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
change that aspect of it just clarify
 
02:35:38.429 --> 02:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
the words you see there
 
02:35:40.750 --> 02:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
y okay thank
 
02:35:44.349 --> 02:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
you uh representative krishman thank you
 
02:35:48.590 --> 02:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I have a question for you do
 
02:35:50.990 --> 02:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
does so I I see there was language and
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I apologize I'm not finding it right
 
02:35:55.950 --> 02:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
at the moment um but it removes the
 
02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
right of providers and Facilities to opt
 
02:36:00.349 --> 02:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
out of dnrs or living wills can you
 
02:36:03.150 --> 02:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
explain why that
 
02:36:10.429 --> 02:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:15.349 --> 02:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
bill 23 line 16 it's page 23 line 16 and
 
02:36:15.359 --> 02:36:29.389 align:start position:0%
bill 23 line 16 it's page 23 line 16 and
17

02:36:29.389 --> 02:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:38.070 --> 02:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:42.830 --> 02:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:45.269 --> 02:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
six yeah if I could represent I might
 
02:36:47.950 --> 02:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
want to refer that that to um attorney
 
02:36:50.070 --> 02:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
Kate Hana who could probably best speak
 
02:37:05.469 --> 02:37:05.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:08.429 --> 02:37:08.439 align:start position:0%
change and would the person I did not
 
02:37:11.269 --> 02:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
catch the name that you referred us to
 
02:37:14.510 --> 02:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
yep attorney Kate Hannah okay I will
 
02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
call then Kate Hannah attorney Kate
 
02:37:19.190 --> 02:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
Hannah if you're in the meeting to
 
02:37:22.150 --> 02:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
explain uh for the representative page
 
02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:38.190 --> 02:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
to6 I don't do not see her in the list
 
02:37:41.950 --> 02:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair I would ask that people be
 
02:37:45.150 --> 02:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to testify that we get to all
 
02:37:47.830 --> 02:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
people and let them testify completely
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
because I think there are people lined
 
02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
up who are going to explain these things
 
02:37:55.269 --> 02:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
who are the appropriate thing people to
 
02:37:57.429 --> 02:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
explain them and who have them in their
 
02:37:59.469 --> 02:37:59.479 align:start position:0%
testimony if only we could get to it as
 
02:37:59.479 --> 02:38:00.309 align:start position:0%
testimony if only we could get to it as
a

02:38:00.309 --> 02:38:00.319 align:start position:0%

02:38:02.790 --> 02:38:02.800 align:start position:0%

Coalition that carefully considered this
 
02:39:08.510 --> 02:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
statute and we worked with stakeholders
 
02:39:11.429 --> 02:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
to draft improvements the association
 
02:39:13.910 --> 02:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
strongly supports Senate Bill
 
02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
74 medicine is changed much during the
 
02:39:18.429 --> 02:39:18.439 align:start position:0%
past 30 years since New Hampshire
 
02:39:21.349 --> 02:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
enacted its Advanced Directive laws but
 
02:39:23.590 --> 02:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
what has not changed is the respect for
 
02:39:26.630 --> 02:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
the individual's right to choose medical
 
02:39:28.950 --> 02:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
treatment they want and decline medical
 
02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
treatment they do not want ensuring that
 
02:39:33.429 --> 02:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
an individual's wishes are honored at
 
02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
end of life when the person may be
 
02:39:38.910 --> 02:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
unable to articulate their wishes is the
 
02:39:40.830 --> 02:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
core of the legislation that the late
 
02:39:42.870 --> 02:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
Senator Susan mlan championed in the
 
02:39:45.830 --> 02:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
late 80s and early 90s and it remains
 
02:39:48.429 --> 02:39:48.439 align:start position:0%
the core of Senate Bill 74 that was
 
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
passed by the Senate I think it's
 
02:39:52.150 --> 02:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
important for you to know that New
 
02:39:54.830 --> 02:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's current law is clunky and
 
02:39:57.630 --> 02:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
often difficult to understand Senate
 
02:39:59.870 --> 02:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 74 improves New Hampshire's
 
02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
Advanced Directive law by clarifying
 
02:40:05.230 --> 02:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
definitions and simply simplifying much
 
02:40:07.550 --> 02:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
of what I would call the legal EAS in
 
02:40:10.670 --> 02:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
the existing form it will also make it
 
02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
easier for health care providers to
 
02:40:15.670 --> 02:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
honor patients wishes without having to
 
02:40:18.389 --> 02:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
seek legal counsel or judicial
 
02:40:21.070 --> 02:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
orders and it will allow for smoother
 
02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
handouts I I'm sorry handoffs between
 
02:40:27.190 --> 02:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
providers allowing medical orders to
 
02:40:29.710 --> 02:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
follow the patient across the Continuum
 
02:40:29.720 --> 02:40:30.550 align:start position:0%
follow the patient across the Continuum
of

02:40:30.550 --> 02:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:40:34.110 --> 02:40:34.120 align:start position:0%
Care one major Improvement is on page 15
 
02:40:37.349 --> 02:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
of the bill the disclosure statement
 
02:40:39.190 --> 02:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
which must accompany the advanced
 
02:40:42.269 --> 02:40:42.279 align:start position:0%
directive document has been revised from
 
02:40:44.830 --> 02:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
the lengthy legal J jargon that is
 
02:40:48.309 --> 02:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
currently in the law to concise simple
 
02:40:51.030 --> 02:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
language it covers all the same points
 
02:40:53.510 --> 02:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
in the current law that an individual
 
02:40:57.030 --> 02:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
should know prior to signing an advanced
 
02:41:00.110 --> 02:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
directive another Improvement relates to
 
02:41:03.590 --> 02:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
surrogacy in the existing law there is
 
02:41:06.870 --> 02:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
confusion as to whether the surrogate
 
02:41:10.150 --> 02:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
has the same Authority as an appointed
 
02:41:11.950 --> 02:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
agent in all
 
02:41:14.750 --> 02:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances some legal councils have
 
02:41:17.710 --> 02:41:17.720 align:start position:0%
advised that a surrogate such as a wife
 
02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
a husband or an adult child may not be
 
02:41:22.910 --> 02:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
able to consent to withholding or
 
02:41:25.349 --> 02:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
withdrawal a life sustaining treatment
 
02:41:27.790 --> 02:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire's existing law
 
02:41:29.950 --> 02:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
only allows an agent to do that with
 
02:41:31.990 --> 02:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
Express written permission in an
 
02:41:34.910 --> 02:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
advanced directive but here's the Catch
 
02:41:38.429 --> 02:41:38.439 align:start position:0%
22 a person becomes a surrogate because
 
02:41:41.790 --> 02:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
there is no written Advanced Directive
 
02:41:44.349 --> 02:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
so Senate Bill 74 eliminates the
 
02:41:46.990 --> 02:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
requirement that an individual expressly
 
02:41:49.670 --> 02:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
P permit in writing the withholding and
 
02:41:52.190 --> 02:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
withdrawal of life sustaining treatment
 
02:41:55.030 --> 02:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
although somebody can certainly um write
 
02:41:56.469 --> 02:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
that into their
 
02:41:58.870 --> 02:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
document this has been a cause of great
 
02:42:01.590 --> 02:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
confusion for agents providers and
 
02:42:04.269 --> 02:42:04.279 align:start position:0%
especially for family members who are
 
02:42:07.070 --> 02:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
surrogate decision makers it has also
 
02:42:08.790 --> 02:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
been problematic when providers
 
02:42:10.550 --> 02:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
encounter an outof State advance
 
02:42:13.469 --> 02:42:13.479 align:start position:0%
directive that does not have this
 
02:42:17.349 --> 02:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
requirement Senate Bill 7 4 recognizes
 
02:42:20.070 --> 02:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
DNR orders pulse and their counterparts
 
02:42:22.790 --> 02:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
from other states and this means that a
 
02:42:24.750 --> 02:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
practitioner order for life- sustaining
 
02:42:26.870 --> 02:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
treatment can accompany a patient in
 
02:42:29.790 --> 02:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
whatever setting they may be a hospital
 
02:42:32.469 --> 02:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
a nursing home or at home with a home
 
02:42:35.710 --> 02:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
care or hospice providers and this is so
 
02:42:38.190 --> 02:42:38.200 align:start position:0%
important to honoring an individual's
 
02:42:40.990 --> 02:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
wish across the Continuum of
 
02:42:44.630 --> 02:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
Care lastly we strongly support the
 
02:42:49.870 --> 02:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
provision on page 26 lines 24 through 29
 
02:42:51.670 --> 02:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
that extends The Authority for a
 
02:42:55.309 --> 02:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
surrogate decision maker from 90 to 180
 
02:42:57.910 --> 02:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
days this is important for hospice
 
02:43:00.630 --> 02:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
patients it makes it less likely that
 
02:43:02.269 --> 02:43:02.279 align:start position:0%
families will need to go through the
 
02:43:04.150 --> 02:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
guardianship process and their loved
 
02:43:05.830 --> 02:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
ones final
 
02:43:08.269 --> 02:43:08.279 align:start position:0%
days on behalf of New Hampshire's Home
 
02:43:09.550 --> 02:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
Care Hospice and paliative care
 
02:43:11.630 --> 02:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
providers and the patients they serve I
 
02:43:14.389 --> 02:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
ask that you recommend Senate Bill 74 as
 
02:43:15.830 --> 02:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
02:43:18.790 --> 02:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
and I will take a stab Mr chairman if
 
02:43:21.070 --> 02:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
you allow me to answer a couple of the
 
02:43:24.670 --> 02:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
questions that have come up so one of
 
02:43:27.550 --> 02:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
the points that I just wanted to make is
 
02:43:31.030 --> 02:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
that actually on page six I think it was
 
02:43:32.790 --> 02:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative kushman who asked about
 
02:43:36.389 --> 02:43:36.399 align:start position:0%
page six lines 3 through six that says
 
02:43:38.309 --> 02:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
any health care provider or residential
 
02:43:40.349 --> 02:43:40.359 align:start position:0%
care provider which does not recognize
 
02:43:42.190 --> 02:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
dnrs or living
 
02:43:47.710 --> 02:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
wills um should post a sign sign um that
 
02:43:52.030 --> 02:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
was deleted because to be honest we know
 
02:43:56.269 --> 02:43:56.279 align:start position:0%
of no provider that has such a sign uh
 
02:44:01.349 --> 02:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
that was actually put in um in um sort
 
02:44:05.070 --> 02:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
of halfhazard in the Senate during one
 
02:44:07.710 --> 02:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
um during several years ago when the
 
02:44:10.269 --> 02:44:10.279 align:start position:0%
statute was being revised but there is
 
02:44:13.670 --> 02:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
still in this this bill there are
 
02:44:16.429 --> 02:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
Provisions that allow both an a
 
02:44:21.870 --> 02:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
practitioner as an individual to um to
 
02:44:25.670 --> 02:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
basically um transfer a patient to
 
02:44:28.070 --> 02:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
another provider if they feel they canot
 
02:44:32.950 --> 02:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
comply with the living will and also for
 
02:44:37.309 --> 02:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
a provider and in in this statute a
 
02:44:40.750 --> 02:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
facility is defined as a provider an
 
02:44:43.349 --> 02:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
individual practitioner is divined like
 
02:44:45.190 --> 02:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
a physician or a nurse practitioner is
 
02:44:48.150 --> 02:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
defined as a practitioner so it's still
 
02:44:51.790 --> 02:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
in there it's just this sign um
 
02:44:54.990 --> 02:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
requirement is taken out um the other
 
02:44:57.790 --> 02:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
thing that I wanted to just point out is
 
02:45:02.429 --> 02:45:02.439 align:start position:0%
that um and I'm looking on page eight uh
 
02:45:05.750 --> 02:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
in in uh response to one of the speakers
 
02:45:09.590 --> 02:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh who testified earlier page eight line
 
02:45:11.309 --> 02:45:11.319 align:start position:0%
five still
 
02:45:15.269 --> 02:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
maintains that uh an agent cannot
 
02:45:17.870 --> 02:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
consent to voluntary sterilization it is
 
02:45:21.150 --> 02:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
still in the statute it was crossed out
 
02:45:24.070 --> 02:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
someplace else in the statute because
 
02:45:27.110 --> 02:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
there things were moved around that's
 
02:45:31.510 --> 02:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
all um and I I will be happy to answer
 
02:45:35.710 --> 02:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions that um that um well
 
02:45:37.309 --> 02:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
I will attempt to answer any questions
 
02:45:41.230 --> 02:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
that others might have representative G
 
02:45:43.150 --> 02:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:45:47.910 --> 02:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um if a practitioner
 
02:45:49.389 --> 02:45:49.399 align:start position:0%
finds that they
 
02:45:53.030 --> 02:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
cannot uh they cannot they they are not
 
02:45:56.030 --> 02:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable following the
 
02:45:58.990 --> 02:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
um the patients
 
02:46:02.190 --> 02:46:02.200 align:start position:0%
directives you said they can pass that
 
02:46:05.190 --> 02:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
patient transfer that patient to another
 
02:46:08.190 --> 02:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
practitioner is that a requirement in
 
02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:09.230 align:start position:0%
practitioner is that a requirement in
this

02:46:09.230 --> 02:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:46:12.309 --> 02:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
bill but they do if they do not feel
 
02:46:14.670 --> 02:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
like they can follow what they've been
 
02:46:18.510 --> 02:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
asking to do they do have to inform the
 
02:46:22.590 --> 02:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
the agent or the surrogate and I and I'm
 
02:46:24.830 --> 02:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
actually looking for the section right
 
02:46:24.840 --> 02:46:27.190 align:start position:0%
actually looking for the section right
now

02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:46:28.870 --> 02:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
P I'm
 
02:46:33.190 --> 02:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
sorry page nine Lin 30 through 34 was
 
02:46:37.469 --> 02:46:37.479 align:start position:0%
crossed out um that requires the
 
02:46:39.510 --> 02:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
informing of the patient and the
 
02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:40.750 align:start position:0%
informing of the patient and the
patient's

02:46:40.750 --> 02:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
patient's
 
02:46:43.990 --> 02:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
family but it's been struck from this
 
02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:51.030 align:start position:0%
family but it's been struck from this
bill

02:46:51.030 --> 02:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:54.910 --> 02:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
you said page nine y lines 30 through 34
 
02:46:57.790 --> 02:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
but that's where it's struck so I I
 
02:46:59.750 --> 02:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't see yes it was I believe it was
 
02:47:03.190 --> 02:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
moved to another section and I'm just um
 
02:47:05.420 --> 02:47:05.430 align:start position:0%
live and following seems to pick up the
 
02:47:05.430 --> 02:47:09.510 align:start position:0%
live and following seems to pick up the
[Music]

02:47:09.510 --> 02:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:13.309 --> 02:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
theme I I think it's on page N9 line 35
 
02:47:15.349 --> 02:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
on where it talks about making the
 
02:47:18.750 --> 02:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
necessary arrangements without
 
02:47:20.990 --> 02:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
delay it'd immediately follow us the
 
02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.349 align:start position:0%
delay it'd immediately follow us the
truck

02:47:23.349 --> 02:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:27.269 --> 02:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
section yes yes it is definitely in
 
02:47:30.790 --> 02:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
there um that they Pro the provider that
 
02:47:33.750 --> 02:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
the the practitioner must inform the
 
02:47:36.150 --> 02:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
family uh or the the agent or the
 
02:47:39.070 --> 02:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
surrogate and shall assist in arranging
 
02:47:42.750 --> 02:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
for transfer to another um provider to
 
02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:43.790 align:start position:0%
for transfer to another um provider to
another

02:47:43.790 --> 02:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:47:47.630 --> 02:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
practitioner um so it is in there any
 
02:47:51.269 --> 02:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
sections simply moved around 35 and
 
02:47:58.510 --> 02:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:01.190 --> 02:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
that they are still required to fulfill
 
02:48:05.870 --> 02:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
that that yes yeah we see it we see it
 
02:48:08.790 --> 02:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
any other questions from Miss
 
02:48:12.429 --> 02:48:12.439 align:start position:0%
balkus yes Mr chairman uh sounds like
 
02:48:14.870 --> 02:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant it is thank you
 
02:48:16.630 --> 02:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mrs
 
02:48:20.030 --> 02:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
vus um in talking about experimental
 
02:48:22.389 --> 02:48:22.399 align:start position:0%
care when I look at
 
02:48:28.830 --> 02:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
the page 17 folks and looking at line
 
02:48:31.750 --> 02:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
34 it says Li Su standing cement within
 
02:48:33.230 --> 02:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
the limits of generally accepted
 
02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
standards of care experimental therapy
 
02:48:37.070 --> 02:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
normally does not become accepted
 
02:48:38.870 --> 02:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
General standards of care until it's
 
02:48:40.469 --> 02:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
been accepted generally speaking that's
 
02:48:41.630 --> 02:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
why it's
 
02:48:43.910 --> 02:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
experimental in saying that statement
 
02:48:45.990 --> 02:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
then it first per say excludes the use
 
02:48:49.670 --> 02:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
of experimental care because if I select
 
02:48:51.870 --> 02:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
that I'm not specifically addressing the
 
02:48:54.750 --> 02:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
issue of experimental care so should the
 
02:48:57.910 --> 02:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
form in include an option in there for
 
02:49:00.349 --> 02:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
the patient to select experimental care
 
02:49:03.630 --> 02:49:03.640 align:start position:0%
in addition to generally accepted care
 
02:49:08.190 --> 02:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
so I am going to yield to uh either the
 
02:49:13.830 --> 02:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
attorneys who are on the call or to uh
 
02:49:18.030 --> 02:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
Dr Lawson who may be on the call

treatment provisions of the statute or
 
02:49:32.990 --> 02:49:33.000 align:start position:0%

Dartmouth
 
02:50:03.750 --> 02:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock uh I'm I was raising my hand
 
02:50:06.269 --> 02:50:06.279 align:start position:0%
to testify to the experimental
 
02:50:07.910 --> 02:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
treatments and clinical trial sections
 
02:50:10.469 --> 02:50:10.479 align:start position:0%
in general which I'm happy do to do but
 
02:50:13.469 --> 02:50:13.479 align:start position:0%
I will um hold on that to answer
 
02:50:15.429 --> 02:50:15.439 align:start position:0%
representative Merchants question
 
02:50:16.870 --> 02:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh pertaining to whether or not the form
 
02:50:20.309 --> 02:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
has been updated uh to give that
 
02:50:23.190 --> 02:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
specific distinguished category of
 
02:50:28.469 --> 02:50:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:31.550 --> 02:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
yes if I may Mr
 
02:50:36.110 --> 02:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you um Mr Hood so
 
02:50:37.990 --> 02:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
there's no conflict between generally
 
02:50:39.710 --> 02:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
accepted healthare standards and
 
02:50:39.720 --> 02:50:42.990 align:start position:0%
accepted healthare standards and
experimental

02:50:42.990 --> 02:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:46.070 --> 02:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
care um so I so I know that this is
 
02:50:48.510 --> 02:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
becoming a common theme in this uh
 
02:50:50.950 --> 02:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
hearing that I would defer that question
 
02:50:53.510 --> 02:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
to one of the Physicians uh or frankly I
 
02:50:55.150 --> 02:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
could get the question answered by our
 
02:50:57.830 --> 02:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
legal council um what I thought the
 
02:51:01.550 --> 02:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
question was is has the uh durable Power
 
02:51:05.870 --> 02:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
of Attorney form been amended to reflect
 
02:51:09.870 --> 02:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
the agent uh authority to consent to a
 
02:51:13.550 --> 02:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
clinical trial and the answer to that is
 
02:51:13.560 --> 02:51:15.950 align:start position:0%
clinical trial and the answer to that is
yes

02:51:15.950 --> 02:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:51:19.110 --> 02:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
so if I understand Mr chairman if I may
 
02:51:20.910 --> 02:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
under the Ural power that's where it's
 
02:51:22.750 --> 02:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
addressed not in the living
 
02:51:26.070 --> 02:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
will it it's in it's in the um my
 
02:51:27.590 --> 02:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
understanding and I'm happy to be
 
02:51:28.950 --> 02:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
corrected but my understanding is that
 
02:51:32.550 --> 02:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
is in the instruction to the um durable
 
02:51:35.070 --> 02:51:35.080 align:start position:0%
power form it's in the statute if you
 
02:51:36.590 --> 02:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
look at the form further down as you
 
02:51:41.550 --> 02:51:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:43.990 --> 02:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
there I'd like to get a legal opinion
 
02:51:46.150 --> 02:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
because when I read this I hear your
 
02:51:49.990 --> 02:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
point um I see it as a conflict because
 
02:51:52.030 --> 02:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
I don't see experimental care becoming
 
02:51:53.910 --> 02:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
generally acceptable Healthcare
 
02:51:55.910 --> 02:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
standards until they've been through the
 
02:51:57.309 --> 02:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
experiment and things have been signed
 
02:51:59.349 --> 02:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
off on if you will accepted by the
 
02:52:02.550 --> 02:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
medical community at large so in saying
 
02:52:04.469 --> 02:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
that the way it's worded I just think it
 
02:52:06.750 --> 02:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
could be ambiguous and possibly
 
02:52:13.469 --> 02:52:13.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:13.479 --> 02:52:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
there

02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:52:19.190 --> 02:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
if I may if I may um speak to the
 
02:52:20.750 --> 02:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
experimental treatment clinical trial
 
02:52:23.349 --> 02:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
Section with representative Merchants
 
02:52:25.429 --> 02:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
question follow-up question in mind it
 
02:52:27.750 --> 02:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
may provide Clarity for that just about
 
02:52:30.750 --> 02:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
to ask you to do that thank thank you
 
02:52:34.349 --> 02:52:34.359 align:start position:0%
very much and um by by way of
 
02:52:38.750 --> 02:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
background uh this issue came to light
 
02:52:41.309 --> 02:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
uh in the early stages of
 
02:52:43.750 --> 02:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
covid-19 um because there existed
 
02:52:45.950 --> 02:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
situations across the country but
 
02:52:48.710 --> 02:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
frankly also in the states where patent
 
02:52:51.229 --> 02:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
patients were suffering severe symptoms
 
02:52:52.750 --> 02:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
of covid and were brought into the
 
02:52:54.750 --> 02:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals darmouth Hitchcock certainly
 
02:52:57.590 --> 02:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
but but not alone and other hospitals as
 
02:53:00.229 --> 02:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
well where there were potential
 
02:53:02.309 --> 02:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
experimental treatments available but
 
02:53:04.550 --> 02:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
provid providers were unable to
 
02:53:08.389 --> 02:53:08.399 align:start position:0%
administer those because the patient was
 
02:53:09.910 --> 02:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
unable to give consent whether they were
 
02:53:11.990 --> 02:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
intubated or
 
02:53:16.229 --> 02:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
otherwise even if there was a a spouse
 
02:53:20.030 --> 02:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
or an agent who wanted to consent on
 
02:53:21.750 --> 02:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
behalf of the
 
02:53:24.710 --> 02:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
patient that could not happen because of
 
02:53:27.429 --> 02:53:27.439 align:start position:0%
the prohibition in statute to giving an
 
02:53:31.190 --> 02:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
agent giving consent to experimental
 
02:53:36.389 --> 02:53:36.399 align:start position:0%
treatments this was literally um life or
 
02:53:39.630 --> 02:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
death and uh we appreciative of the
 
02:53:42.630 --> 02:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
governor's office giving an executive
 
02:53:45.950 --> 02:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
order that suspends essentially that
 
02:53:49.190 --> 02:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
prohibition with respect to those
 
02:53:50.630 --> 02:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
suffering severe
 
02:53:54.269 --> 02:53:54.279 align:start position:0%
covid um symptoms the legislature
 
02:53:57.429 --> 02:53:57.439 align:start position:0%
followed suit and largely codified that
 
02:54:00.750 --> 02:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
executive order but it sunsets at the
 
02:54:03.190 --> 02:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
end of June this year which is why this
 
02:54:09.070 --> 02:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:12.150 --> 02:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
74 without I acknowledge the limitation
 
02:54:16.429 --> 02:54:16.439 align:start position:0%
to co um and so let me speak to what the
 
02:54:19.469 --> 02:54:19.479 align:start position:0%
provision would allow which it would
 
02:54:22.710 --> 02:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
give Authority in certain limited
 
02:54:25.150 --> 02:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances for an agent or surrogate
 
02:54:26.830 --> 02:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
to consent to experimental treatments or
 
02:54:29.550 --> 02:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
clinical trials they include that the
 
02:54:31.110 --> 02:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
situation be
 
02:54:33.590 --> 02:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
life-threatening uh disease or condition
 
02:54:35.389 --> 02:54:35.399 align:start position:0%
or a serious disease or condition that
 
02:54:37.389 --> 02:54:37.399 align:start position:0%
would result in impairment of
 
02:54:39.670 --> 02:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
function that there's no alternative
 
02:54:39.680 --> 02:54:40.830 align:start position:0%
function that there's no alternative
therapy

02:54:40.830 --> 02:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
02:54:43.229 --> 02:54:43.239 align:start position:0%
available and that it's authorized by an
 
02:54:45.550 --> 02:54:45.560 align:start position:0%
internal review board consistent and
 
02:54:46.870 --> 02:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
consistent with relevant state and
 
02:54:50.510 --> 02:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
federal regulations and finally it's a
 
02:54:52.389 --> 02:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
this is applicable where the advance
 
02:54:54.389 --> 02:54:54.399 align:start position:0%
directive is silent such that the
 
02:54:57.349 --> 02:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
principle can can
 
02:55:00.670 --> 02:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
decline in the document and such
 
02:55:02.150 --> 02:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
Authority would not be
 
02:55:06.630 --> 02:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
available so working with other
 
02:55:09.229 --> 02:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um colleague uh
 
02:55:10.750 --> 02:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders at the disability rights
 
02:55:13.790 --> 02:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
Center and others we constrained the
 
02:55:15.710 --> 02:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
language with respect to authorization
 
02:55:18.349 --> 02:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
of agent surrogate for experimental
 
02:55:20.030 --> 02:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
treatments or clinical
 
02:55:23.630 --> 02:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
trials I'll close with that section and
 
02:55:25.630 --> 02:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
because I think Miss bulus referenced
 
02:55:30.110 --> 02:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
that the prohibitions that existed with
 
02:55:33.349 --> 02:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
respect to sterilization and involuntary
 
02:55:35.429 --> 02:55:35.439 align:start position:0%
uh commitment remain there there was a
 
02:55:37.670 --> 02:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
strikeout of of the sterilization piece
 
02:55:39.670 --> 02:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
in one one place but it remains in
 
02:55:42.070 --> 02:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
section B of five so I I just wanted to
 
02:55:45.229 --> 02:55:45.239 align:start position:0%
reiterate that and I'm happy to answer
 
02:55:49.469 --> 02:55:49.479 align:start position:0%
questions um uh that I
 
02:55:52.150 --> 02:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
can does anyone have a question that he
 
02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:57.870 align:start position:0%
can does anyone have a question that he
can

02:55:57.870 --> 02:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:01.030 --> 02:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
answer um let's see representative
 
02:56:04.190 --> 02:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you Mr
 
02:56:08.190 --> 02:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you can you tell me if if

who has um completed the current forms
 
02:56:16.070 --> 02:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
for advanced directives and durable
 
02:56:19.150 --> 02:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
power of attorney then need to go back
 
02:56:22.670 --> 02:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
to um a lawyer and have the process
 
02:56:22.680 --> 02:56:23.950 align:start position:0%
to um a lawyer and have the process
started

02:56:23.950 --> 02:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
started
 
02:56:26.670 --> 02:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
over uh that's a uh thank you that's a
 
02:56:28.429 --> 02:56:28.439 align:start position:0%
great question representative kushman I

appreciate it it was a discussion of of
 
02:56:35.229 --> 02:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
topic um on the numerous calls that were
 
02:56:37.710 --> 02:56:37.720 align:start position:0%
referenced um but that's a question I'm
 
02:56:38.910 --> 02:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
going to deferred to the attorneys on
 
02:56:43.070 --> 02:56:43.080 align:start position:0%

02:56:49.750 --> 02:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding just briefly is that
 
02:56:51.309 --> 02:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
the answer is no but I but I want to
 
02:56:54.190 --> 02:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
defer so you have a a a full or legal

question I see representative Nelson's
 
02:57:00.200 --> 02:57:03.950 align:start position:0%
question I see representative Nelson's
hand

02:57:03.950 --> 02:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:07.910 --> 02:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:10.389 --> 02:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
unmute this point I'm totally confused
 
02:57:11.710 --> 02:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
because there seems to be some
 
02:57:14.550 --> 02:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
conflicting ideas uh one of the things I
 
02:57:16.710 --> 02:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
thought I heard earlier was that the
 
02:57:18.790 --> 02:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
person could have in
 
02:57:21.190 --> 02:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
writing that they do not want to be
 
02:57:24.030 --> 02:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
resuscitated but the hospital or
 
02:57:26.030 --> 02:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
whatever can override
 
02:57:29.309 --> 02:57:29.319 align:start position:0%
that on the other hand what I just heard
 
02:57:31.630 --> 02:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to go that way and I'm just
 
02:57:35.349 --> 02:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
confused as to what's happening because
 
02:57:40.790 --> 02:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:43.269 --> 02:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
me uh well representative I've been on
 
02:57:45.710 --> 02:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
I've been on the uh the hearing for the
 
02:57:47.910 --> 02:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
duration so uh with respect to the
 
02:57:49.670 --> 02:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
conversation about what a what
 
02:57:53.429 --> 02:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
a um hospital or provider can or cannot
 
02:57:53.439 --> 02:57:55.110 align:start position:0%
a um hospital or provider can or cannot
do

02:57:55.110 --> 02:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:57:57.550 --> 02:57:57.560 align:start position:0%
uh you've heard the same things I have
 
02:57:59.389 --> 02:57:59.399 align:start position:0%
with respect to this
 
02:58:03.349 --> 02:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
provision a principal can do any number
 
02:58:08.469 --> 02:58:08.479 align:start position:0%
of things they can say I want any manner
 
02:58:10.070 --> 02:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
of experimental treatment doesn't have
 
02:58:12.429 --> 02:58:12.439 align:start position:0%
to be life- saving doesn't have to be a
 
02:58:15.389 --> 02:58:15.399 align:start position:0%
serious illness or condition that's one
 
02:58:17.990 --> 02:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
scenario they can do they can also say I
 
02:58:20.710 --> 02:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
don't want any and that is to be
 
02:58:22.910 --> 02:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
respected and then the third is they can
 
02:58:25.110 --> 02:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
be silent and it's the situation of
 
02:58:27.750 --> 02:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
Silence that I'm discussing which is
 
02:58:32.950 --> 02:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
what are then in the absence of of uh uh
 
02:58:35.070 --> 02:58:35.080 align:start position:0%
selection is an agent or a surrogate
 
02:58:36.469 --> 02:58:36.479 align:start position:0%
entitled to do with respect to clinical
 
02:58:38.550 --> 02:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
trials or experimental treatments I hope
 
02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:46.510 --> 02:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
scenario I guess uh when you said that
 
02:58:51.550 --> 02:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
uh you f you Hospital whatever can give
 
02:58:54.590 --> 02:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
experimental drugs without the would
 
02:58:56.469 --> 02:58:56.479 align:start position:0%
override everything if the hospital
 
02:59:00.150 --> 02:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to um that seems to conflict with
 
02:59:01.150 --> 02:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
some of the things that were said
 
02:59:03.950 --> 02:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
earlier that's just me sorry about that
 
02:59:05.309 --> 02:59:05.319 align:start position:0%
yeah no well I would want to be clear
 
02:59:07.950 --> 02:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
for the record um that that is not as
 
02:59:11.070 --> 02:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
not what I intended to say in fact uh
 
02:59:12.750 --> 02:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
what the reason that we raised this
 
02:59:15.630 --> 02:59:15.640 align:start position:0%
issue and inclusion in Senate Bill 74
 
02:59:17.349 --> 02:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
was that our providers could
 
02:59:21.110 --> 02:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
not um give experimental treatments in
 
02:59:23.150 --> 02:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
the absence of consent and the Agents
 
02:59:28.550 --> 02:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:31.870 --> 02:59:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:34.910 --> 02:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
you any further questions for this
 
02:59:34.920 --> 02:59:36.710 align:start position:0%
you any further questions for this
speaker

02:59:36.710 --> 02:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
02:59:39.110 --> 02:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
chman um I think I see representative
 
02:59:41.910 --> 02:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
Merchant's hand up thank you Mr chairman
 
02:59:44.349 --> 02:59:44.359 align:start position:0%
I'll still go back to
 
02:59:48.670 --> 02:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
Mr Hood um would you be opposed to
 
02:59:53.150 --> 02:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
modifying the form language in the bill
 
02:59:54.830 --> 02:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
so it specifically
 
02:59:57.429 --> 02:59:57.439 align:start position:0%
says that the patient consents to
 
03:00:00.190 --> 03:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
experimental care in addition to life
 
03:00:02.190 --> 03:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
threatening so there's two options there
 
03:00:04.469 --> 03:00:04.479 align:start position:0%
one is strictly looking at the generally
 
03:00:07.030 --> 03:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
accepted as well as an option for
 
03:00:10.510 --> 03:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
including experiment experimental
 
03:00:13.070 --> 03:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
care that way there it's specific on the
 
03:00:14.990 --> 03:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
form so the patient has to sign off on
 
03:00:16.429 --> 03:00:16.439 align:start position:0%
it not something that's embeded into the
 
03:00:18.429 --> 03:00:18.439 align:start position:0%
bill somewhere else that refers back to
 
03:00:20.710 --> 03:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
it so the form itself is very clear that
 
03:00:23.710 --> 03:00:23.720 align:start position:0%
I agree to experimental care as well as
 
03:00:26.910 --> 03:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
General accepted Health Care at the same
 
03:00:29.030 --> 03:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
time so it's two options for the patient
 
03:00:33.070 --> 03:00:33.080 align:start position:0%
one strictly generally accepted care two
 
03:00:35.710 --> 03:00:35.720 align:start position:0%
that provision plus experimental
 
03:00:38.630 --> 03:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
care so representative Merion I'm I'm
 
03:00:41.630 --> 03:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
certainly amenable to Clarity of uh
 
03:00:44.309 --> 03:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
language and the only caveat that I
 
03:00:45.870 --> 03:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
would give is that this has been a
 
03:00:48.269 --> 03:00:48.279 align:start position:0%
thoroughly involved stakeholder
 
03:00:50.670 --> 03:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
engagement process and I can't speak for
 
03:00:52.590 --> 03:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
the entirety of the group that being
 
03:00:56.190 --> 03:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
said we can convene to determine if that
 
03:00:57.950 --> 03:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
would be amendable to the larger group
 
03:01:02.630 --> 03:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:05.070 --> 03:01:05.080 align:start position:0%
that thank you if you decide to pull
 
03:01:07.830 --> 03:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
together a group before we EX on it I be
 
03:01:11.070 --> 03:01:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:16.990 --> 03:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
it and might I suggest uh Mr hood that
 
03:01:20.630 --> 03:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
um at least in addition to bringing the
 
03:01:22.910 --> 03:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
group your group back together you bring
 
03:01:25.630 --> 03:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
those legislators who have had various
 
03:01:28.790 --> 03:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
questions this this is not clear so that
 
03:01:31.550 --> 03:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
the any Amendment to the form could be
 
03:01:35.429 --> 03:01:35.439 align:start position:0%
done by both us who wish to participate
 
03:01:37.349 --> 03:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
and the group who pulled all this
 
03:01:39.349 --> 03:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
together and the reason I suggest that
 
03:01:42.630 --> 03:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
is I would hate to have just us do
 
03:01:42.640 --> 03:01:44.870 align:start position:0%
is I would hate to have just us do
it

03:01:44.870 --> 03:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:01:46.630 --> 03:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mr chair I I just missed the
 
03:01:48.750 --> 03:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
last part of what you said I apologize I
 
03:01:53.030 --> 03:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
would not want just us or just we
 
03:01:56.910 --> 03:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
legislators in an exec session to modify
 
03:02:00.030 --> 03:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
the form so if your group wishes to come
 
03:02:03.190 --> 03:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
back to modify the form it should
 
03:02:04.830 --> 03:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
include any
 
03:02:07.590 --> 03:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
legislators that have objections so that
 
03:02:09.750 --> 03:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
our concerns about what's not in the
 
03:02:12.830 --> 03:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
form would be incorporated um that's
 
03:02:15.590 --> 03:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
more of a state than anything else thank
 
03:02:18.389 --> 03:02:18.399 align:start position:0%
you I I I heard that this time good
 
03:02:25.030 --> 03:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:28.429 --> 03:02:28.439 align:start position:0%
next thank you Mr chairman and I think
 
03:02:29.670 --> 03:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
we are
 
03:02:32.830 --> 03:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
getting very much into the
 
03:02:37.469 --> 03:02:37.479 align:start position:0%
weeds here so for for Mr
 
03:02:42.550 --> 03:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
Hood am I correct in understanding as an
 
03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:44.269 align:start position:0%
Hood am I correct in understanding as an
overview

03:02:44.269 --> 03:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
overview
 
03:02:46.469 --> 03:02:46.479 align:start position:0%
that what
 
03:02:52.190 --> 03:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
this um amendment to existing statute
 
03:02:55.190 --> 03:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
does is that
 
03:02:57.229 --> 03:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
overall it
 
03:03:01.670 --> 03:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
clarifies ways in which a principal may
 
03:03:03.190 --> 03:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
want to
 
03:03:08.670 --> 03:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
specify any one of the whole range of
 
03:03:11.229 --> 03:03:11.239 align:start position:0%
things that they either want to have
 
03:03:15.190 --> 03:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
happen and or that they do not want to
 
03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:16.510 align:start position:0%
happen and or that they do not want to
have

03:03:16.510 --> 03:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:03:22.070 --> 03:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
happen and that then there is language
 
03:03:24.150 --> 03:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
and and if they have
 
03:03:27.229 --> 03:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
specified then that is generally
 
03:03:30.150 --> 03:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
speaking except in very narrow
 
03:03:33.630 --> 03:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
situations what's going to happen and
 
03:03:37.910 --> 03:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
that the rest of the statute deals with
 
03:03:40.469 --> 03:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
what you do when the principal has been
 
03:03:44.269 --> 03:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
silent about their wishes and how you
 
03:03:50.030 --> 03:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
best aim to give effect to what it is or
 
03:03:52.670 --> 03:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
was that the principle has stated that
 
03:03:56.830 --> 03:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:59.429 --> 03:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
past yes so I could say two things
 
03:04:02.590 --> 03:04:02.600 align:start position:0%
representative Weber one is um with
 
03:04:05.670 --> 03:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
respect to the the summary that you just
 
03:04:07.510 --> 03:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
described and the section that I spoke
 
03:04:09.790 --> 03:04:09.800 align:start position:0%
to the answer is yes the other piece
 
03:04:11.790 --> 03:04:11.800 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to point out to
 
03:04:13.150 --> 03:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and the others
 
03:04:14.990 --> 03:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
on the call is there there are
 
03:04:17.229 --> 03:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
instructions and and maybe you saw this
 
03:04:21.070 --> 03:04:21.080 align:start position:0%
but on on page 16 it starts on line 14
 
03:04:23.750 --> 03:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
and then there's there's what I think
 
03:04:26.469 --> 03:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
was intended to be very clear I want to
 
03:04:28.750 --> 03:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
participate in medical clinical trials
 
03:04:32.870 --> 03:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
and then I don't and so when I reach out
 
03:04:35.550 --> 03:04:35.560 align:start position:0%
to representative Merchant I My Hope Is
 
03:04:38.349 --> 03:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
that I will ascertain if if that lacks
 
03:04:40.389 --> 03:04:40.399 align:start position:0%
Clarity in this
 
03:04:42.990 --> 03:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
context and may I have a followup Mr
 
03:04:45.030 --> 03:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
chairman yes
 
03:04:47.630 --> 03:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
please if I can remember what the
 
03:04:49.830 --> 03:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
followup is because my brain just
 
03:04:52.550 --> 03:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
bounced sorry representative I I I took
 
03:04:54.349 --> 03:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
you on a detour there with a number two
 
03:04:57.309 --> 03:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
I apologize that's okay
 
03:05:00.750 --> 03:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
um and oh and here is my follow-up
 
03:05:03.469 --> 03:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
question as as somebody who is very
 
03:05:05.630 --> 03:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
aware of Hospital
 
03:05:08.469 --> 03:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
procedure is it not
 
03:05:13.950 --> 03:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
true that there are many many relig I
 
03:05:17.630 --> 03:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
groups um humanist
 
03:05:22.269 --> 03:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
groups groups who promote thinking on
 
03:05:24.870 --> 03:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
these very difficult issues of end of
 
03:05:28.910 --> 03:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
life decision making who get together
 
03:05:31.469 --> 03:05:31.479 align:start position:0%
just as as we had testimony from the
 
03:05:34.469 --> 03:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
Catholic dasis that they have an entire
 
03:05:36.389 --> 03:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
booklet of
 
03:05:40.469 --> 03:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
guidance for those who wish
 
03:05:44.110 --> 03:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure that their ADV Advanced
 
03:05:47.110 --> 03:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
directives follow their
 
03:05:50.269 --> 03:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
beliefs that there are any number of
 
03:05:53.630 --> 03:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
other groups who help potential patients
 
03:05:57.110 --> 03:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
long before they become patients explore
 
03:05:59.830 --> 03:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
what they might or might not want to
 
03:06:02.790 --> 03:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
include in one of these documents and
 
03:06:05.950 --> 03:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
that it is not at the behest of an
 
03:06:09.950 --> 03:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
attorney or anything else but that you
 
03:06:14.750 --> 03:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
can add directions in that reflect your
 
03:06:17.990 --> 03:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
own personal thoughts that come out of
 
03:06:20.990 --> 03:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
any number of different kinds of
 
03:06:23.070 --> 03:06:23.080 align:start position:0%
discussions uh none of which are
 
03:06:25.469 --> 03:06:25.479 align:start position:0%
specified in the
 
03:06:30.550 --> 03:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
statute yes Clarity from any uh source
 
03:06:30.560 --> 03:06:33.750 align:start position:0%
statute yes Clarity from any uh source
is

03:06:33.750 --> 03:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:36.870 --> 03:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Marsh and one one
 
03:06:39.830 --> 03:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
further followup if I can is is it not
 
03:06:41.750 --> 03:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
true that sometimes those discussion
 
03:06:45.269 --> 03:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
groups result in the execution at the
 
03:06:49.190 --> 03:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
end of them of a document personal to
 
03:06:51.229 --> 03:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
03:06:53.110 --> 03:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
participants I'm sorry representative
 
03:06:54.790 --> 03:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
Weber could you could you just restate
 
03:06:58.790 --> 03:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
the question I uh well let me state it a
 
03:06:58.800 --> 03:06:59.670 align:start position:0%
the question I uh well let me state it a
different

03:06:59.670 --> 03:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:07:04.349 --> 03:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
way um when I was on the Ethics
 
03:07:06.389 --> 03:07:06.399 align:start position:0%
Committee at Brattleboro Memorial
 
03:07:10.510 --> 03:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
Hospital we often had workshops for
 
03:07:13.590 --> 03:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
people on how to fill out these
 
03:07:15.870 --> 03:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
documents and it was just community
 
03:07:20.269 --> 03:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
members y'all come and at the end of
 
03:07:20.279 --> 03:07:21.510 align:start position:0%
members y'all come and at the end of
those

03:07:21.510 --> 03:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:07:25.550 --> 03:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
meetings um sometimes community members
 
03:07:28.550 --> 03:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
would want to fill out the forms right
 
03:07:31.790 --> 03:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
then and there and it was the way of
 
03:07:34.309 --> 03:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
ending that series of meetings should
 
03:07:37.630 --> 03:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
they choose to do so is it not true that
 
03:07:39.910 --> 03:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
there are various groups of various
 
03:07:42.990 --> 03:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
sorts that do that now with respect to
 
03:07:44.590 --> 03:07:44.600 align:start position:0%
the these
 
03:07:47.429 --> 03:07:47.439 align:start position:0%
documents I'm sure that there are I you
 
03:07:51.389 --> 03:07:51.399 align:start position:0%
know I my testimony is constrained to to
 
03:07:53.950 --> 03:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock's experience and and
 
03:07:57.190 --> 03:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
um Dr burin Who's no longer um
 
03:07:59.750 --> 03:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
practicing in the in the Nash area was a
 
03:08:01.710 --> 03:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
leader in the advanced directive space
 
03:08:03.190 --> 03:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
for Dartmouth Hitchcock and and he
 
03:08:05.229 --> 03:08:05.239 align:start position:0%
certainly and we tried to raise
 
03:08:08.710 --> 03:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
awareness about about um the importance
 
03:08:11.670 --> 03:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
of engaging in the process of planning
 
03:08:15.150 --> 03:08:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:18.590 --> 03:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
and and I guess what I was trying to uh
 
03:08:22.110 --> 03:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
focus on and lost sight of is that that
 
03:08:25.229 --> 03:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
does not necessarily mean having to go
 
03:08:27.510 --> 03:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
out and hire a lawyer there are lots of
 
03:08:29.830 --> 03:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
other ways to engage in the planning
 
03:08:32.070 --> 03:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
process with people who have been
 
03:08:35.670 --> 03:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
involved in it that are no cost
 
03:08:38.590 --> 03:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and with with various
 
03:08:42.590 --> 03:08:42.600 align:start position:0%

03:09:03.910 --> 03:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
12 through 15 was precisely the choice
 
03:09:05.389 --> 03:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
that representative Merchant wanted to
 
03:09:07.269 --> 03:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
add by Amendment and I believe he
 
03:09:10.190 --> 03:09:10.200 align:start position:0%

03:10:38.910 --> 03:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:41.590 --> 03:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
wish oh thank you uh my name is Robert
 
03:10:43.670 --> 03:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
Wells uh I live in Hopkinton New
 
03:10:45.510 --> 03:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've been practicing in the
 
03:10:49.030 --> 03:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
field of estate planning for almost 50
 
03:10:51.630 --> 03:10:51.640 align:start position:0%
years um and I would like to defer to
 
03:10:54.510 --> 03:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
Ben who has the detailed information
 
03:10:57.229 --> 03:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
that you may want on the bill itself
 
03:10:59.550 --> 03:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
since he and Jinger Shen were members of
 
03:11:02.229 --> 03:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
a committee of which I'm also a member
 
03:11:04.309 --> 03:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
that really worked uh hand inand with
 
03:11:07.389 --> 03:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
the group to bring this bill to uh
 
03:11:09.990 --> 03:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
fruition uh so I don't have that kind of
 
03:11:12.190 --> 03:11:12.200 align:start position:0%
detailed information but let me make a
 
03:11:12.200 --> 03:11:13.269 align:start position:0%
detailed information but let me make a
comment

03:11:13.269 --> 03:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
comment
 
03:11:15.349 --> 03:11:15.359 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns I have had as a
 
03:11:18.229 --> 03:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
practitioner for these many many years
 
03:11:20.110 --> 03:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
with respect to the Health Care
 
03:11:22.750 --> 03:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
directives is a concern about the
 
03:11:25.510 --> 03:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
medical community and how they can
 
03:11:28.630 --> 03:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
respond to the current document the
 
03:11:30.550 --> 03:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
current document is not helpful to the
 
03:11:32.269 --> 03:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
medical community because they have to
 
03:11:34.830 --> 03:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
keep going back to the document as a
 
03:11:36.910 --> 03:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
patient progresses through various
 
03:11:40.630 --> 03:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
stages of uh of illness with the new
 
03:11:43.830 --> 03:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
document we have the medical profession
 
03:11:47.510 --> 03:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
is more able to deal with the patient in
 
03:11:49.870 --> 03:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
a way consistent with what the patient
 
03:11:53.269 --> 03:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
may want and with an ongoing dialogue
 
03:11:56.309 --> 03:11:56.319 align:start position:0%
with the agent with respect to what the
 
03:11:59.229 --> 03:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
principal may want so I think this
 
03:12:03.229 --> 03:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
change uh is is very very helpful I go
 
03:12:05.790 --> 03:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
all the way back to Susan mlan when she
 
03:12:09.710 --> 03:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
in 1980 uh got introduced and passed the
 
03:12:12.349 --> 03:12:12.359 align:start position:0%
living will which was then vetoed by
 
03:12:13.910 --> 03:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
then Governor John sonunu but
 
03:12:15.870 --> 03:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
fortunately it was his veto was
 
03:12:18.550 --> 03:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
overruled subsequent to that we have had
 
03:12:20.870 --> 03:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
the evolution of healthc care Powers
 
03:12:24.790 --> 03:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
post etc etc but what this bill does is
 
03:12:27.510 --> 03:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
it allows the physician and other
 
03:12:30.750 --> 03:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
medical practitioners to deal with a
 
03:12:33.229 --> 03:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
patient uh and in discussion with the
 
03:12:35.550 --> 03:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
agent in a way which is very very
 
03:12:38.269 --> 03:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
effective uh we now know that our
 
03:12:40.110 --> 03:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
primary doctor is not in the hospital
 
03:12:41.910 --> 03:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's a hospitalist who's in the doctor
 
03:12:43.469 --> 03:12:43.479 align:start position:0%
or in the hospital hospital or an
 
03:12:46.190 --> 03:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
intensivist they may not have a
 
03:12:48.550 --> 03:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
communication with the patient in terms
 
03:12:51.190 --> 03:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
of what he or she may want so the agent
 
03:12:54.150 --> 03:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
then becomes critical uh with respect to
 
03:12:57.630 --> 03:12:57.640 align:start position:0%
what uh the principal wants as I help
 
03:12:59.429 --> 03:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
clients work with these current
 
03:13:01.030 --> 03:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
documents and with in the future with
 
03:13:03.110 --> 03:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
the future document is you have to have
 
03:13:05.590 --> 03:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
an agent who is an effective advocate
 
03:13:08.389 --> 03:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
for you not someone who just sits there
 
03:13:10.349 --> 03:13:10.359 align:start position:0%
and doesn't do anything and just accepts
 
03:13:12.190 --> 03:13:12.200 align:start position:0%
whatever comes their way they must be an
 
03:13:14.070 --> 03:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
advocate and they must be able to
 
03:13:15.630 --> 03:13:15.640 align:start position:0%
confront the medical community with
 
03:13:18.190 --> 03:13:18.200 align:start position:0%
concerns and with issues uh and I think
 
03:13:20.150 --> 03:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
that happens and I know all the doctors
 
03:13:21.710 --> 03:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
that I know and other medical
 
03:13:24.349 --> 03:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
practitioners do everything they can but
 
03:13:26.349 --> 03:13:26.359 align:start position:0%
it is not easy for them to keep going
 
03:13:28.110 --> 03:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
back to the healthc care directive as
 
03:13:29.990 --> 03:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
time moves on with respect to the
 
03:13:32.150 --> 03:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
treatment of a patient so this new
 
03:13:34.670 --> 03:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
document practically speaking takes care
 
03:13:37.269 --> 03:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
of that problem um having done this for
 
03:13:39.510 --> 03:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
so many years and having worked with so
 
03:13:42.110 --> 03:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
many patient so many clients uh whose
 
03:13:44.510 --> 03:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
parents or children or others who were
 
03:13:47.510 --> 03:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
involved with a health care power and
 
03:13:49.670 --> 03:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
the living will they are all so very
 
03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
very thankful we have this document but
 
03:13:54.830 --> 03:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
they do confess that it is complicated
 
03:13:56.269 --> 03:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes for them to deal with the
 
03:13:58.110 --> 03:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
medical community because of the manner
 
03:14:00.790 --> 03:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
by which the current document is written
 
03:14:03.389 --> 03:14:03.399 align:start position:0%
so I would strongly urge that you pass
 
03:14:06.229 --> 03:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
this tremendous work hours and hours and
 
03:14:08.229 --> 03:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
hours of work by so many people to get
 
03:14:10.710 --> 03:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
us to where we are today it would be a
 
03:14:14.030 --> 03:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
shame to turn this back um I do believe
 
03:14:16.870 --> 03:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
strongly that uh a patient rights are
 
03:14:19.510 --> 03:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
protected uh people are not going to go
 
03:14:21.349 --> 03:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
out and act willling nilly with respect
 
03:14:23.429 --> 03:14:23.439 align:start position:0%
to the termination of someone's life I
 
03:14:26.190 --> 03:14:26.200 align:start position:0%
think that is highly irresponsible uh
 
03:14:28.630 --> 03:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
thinking on anyone's part so again I
 
03:14:31.389 --> 03:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
would advocate for the passage of this
 
03:14:33.830 --> 03:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
but I would turn over to my colleague uh
 
03:14:35.950 --> 03:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
Ben to answer specific questions about
 
03:14:37.630 --> 03:14:37.640 align:start position:0%
the development of the document because
 
03:14:39.710 --> 03:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
he and Jinger Shen were the members of
 
03:14:41.429 --> 03:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
our committee who work so closely with
 
03:14:44.389 --> 03:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
this group I'd be happy to answer any
 
03:14:47.750 --> 03:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
questions remind me again of Ben's name
 
03:14:50.590 --> 03:14:50.600 align:start position:0%

own behalf um as well as on the behalf
 
03:15:24.469 --> 03:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire chapter of the
 
03:15:26.590 --> 03:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
National Academy of elder law attorneys
 
03:15:28.389 --> 03:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
which is a membership organization of
 
03:15:30.389 --> 03:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
about 80 attorneys um who represent
 
03:15:32.349 --> 03:15:32.359 align:start position:0%
elders and persons with disabilities in
 
03:15:32.359 --> 03:15:33.150 align:start position:0%
elders and persons with disabilities in
our

03:15:33.150 --> 03:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:15:35.830 --> 03:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
state as well as the group that uh Bob
 
03:15:37.309 --> 03:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
Wells just mention the legislative
 
03:15:38.790 --> 03:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
working group of New Hampshire trust and
 
03:15:40.910 --> 03:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
Estates attorneys which is an informal
 
03:15:43.189 --> 03:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
group of about 40 attorneys to convene
 
03:15:46.229 --> 03:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
approximately monthly to work on
 
03:15:48.349 --> 03:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
legislation um both groups strongly
 
03:15:52.550 --> 03:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
support SB 74 uh Ginger Shen um from the
 
03:15:54.950 --> 03:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
trust and Estates working group um and I
 
03:15:56.710 --> 03:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
on behalf of that group and Nayla
 
03:15:58.590 --> 03:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
actively participated in the working
 
03:16:00.950 --> 03:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
groups that Senator Sherman convened
 
03:16:02.870 --> 03:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
following the Bill's initial
 
03:16:04.910 --> 03:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
introduction there was an in-depth
 
03:16:06.910 --> 03:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
process featuring a robust exchange of
 
03:16:09.110 --> 03:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
views from stakeholders representing
 
03:16:11.429 --> 03:16:11.439 align:start position:0%
many different perspectives and the
 
03:16:13.070 --> 03:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
legislative text was worked through very
 
03:16:14.950 --> 03:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
carefully to try to accommodate all of
 
03:16:16.950 --> 03:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
those various interests and to reach
 
03:16:19.189 --> 03:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
compromises between differing interests
 
03:16:21.630 --> 03:16:21.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm glad we've gotten to a place
 
03:16:23.790 --> 03:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
where um each of the various groups have
 
03:16:25.590 --> 03:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
participated although some were actually
 
03:16:28.750 --> 03:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill at the beginning um
 
03:16:31.110 --> 03:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
um including nla that I was a part of uh
 
03:16:32.990 --> 03:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
came to a place where we were we were in
 
03:16:35.070 --> 03:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
support of the
 
03:16:37.429 --> 03:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
legislation uh the resulting legislation
 
03:16:39.510 --> 03:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
substantially modernizes our Advanced
 
03:16:41.790 --> 03:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
Directive law I think most importantly
 
03:16:43.630 --> 03:16:43.640 align:start position:0%
from my perspective it takes a set of
 
03:16:46.349 --> 03:16:46.359 align:start position:0%
forms that was confusing and required a
 
03:16:48.469 --> 03:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
high level of education and knowledge to
 
03:16:50.830 --> 03:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
read and digest and substantially
 
03:16:52.750 --> 03:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
modified those forms to make them easier
 
03:16:55.229 --> 03:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
to read and understand and we expected
 
03:16:56.670 --> 03:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
individuals whether they're working with
 
03:16:59.150 --> 03:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
an attorney a medical practitioner a
 
03:17:01.870 --> 03:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
social worker a family member or by
 
03:17:04.030 --> 03:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
themselves to complete this form will
 
03:17:05.910 --> 03:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
now be able to do so in a manner that
 
03:17:07.950 --> 03:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
better reflects their wishes and
 
03:17:09.950 --> 03:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
expresses their preferences as compared
 
03:17:11.189 --> 03:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
with the existing
 
03:17:14.150 --> 03:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
form the the disclosure statement at the
 
03:17:16.510 --> 03:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
start of the form um also has been made
 
03:17:19.150 --> 03:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
substantially clearer more userfriendly
 
03:17:21.670 --> 03:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
and uh the use of jargon has been
 
03:17:23.630 --> 03:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
brought down to a minimum so again our
 
03:17:25.550 --> 03:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
Our Hope and our expectation is that it
 
03:17:28.510 --> 03:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
just makes it much easier to use and
 
03:17:30.670 --> 03:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
understand um a couple of the questions
 
03:17:32.070 --> 03:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
have have touched on changes and I'm
 
03:17:33.429 --> 03:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
going to get I'm going to try to address
 
03:17:34.750 --> 03:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
some of the specific questions I heard
 
03:17:37.349 --> 03:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
earlier in a moment um but but for now I
 
03:17:39.750 --> 03:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention I mean the the purpose
 
03:17:41.710 --> 03:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
of the legislation in part was to change
 
03:17:43.590 --> 03:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
certain defaults that were contrary to
 
03:17:45.590 --> 03:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
the preferences of the vast majority of
 
03:17:48.150 --> 03:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
individuals completing the forms um and
 
03:17:49.950 --> 03:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
the result of those defaults was that it
 
03:17:51.590 --> 03:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
was often likely that the form was
 
03:17:54.590 --> 03:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
completed in either a contradictory way
 
03:17:57.309 --> 03:17:57.319 align:start position:0%
or in a way that um did not actually
 
03:17:58.510 --> 03:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
reflect the preferences of the
 
03:18:00.269 --> 03:18:00.279 align:start position:0%
individuals completing the form and I
 
03:18:01.990 --> 03:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
know you know Dr Lawson may be able to
 
03:18:05.349 --> 03:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
speak to that more as well um but in
 
03:18:09.389 --> 03:18:09.399 align:start position:0%
streamlining and simplifying our goal um
 
03:18:13.229 --> 03:18:13.239 align:start position:0%
was to was to make it um as as likely as
 
03:18:14.910 --> 03:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
possible that an individual completing
 
03:18:16.990 --> 03:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
the form is expressing their wishes
 
03:18:19.469 --> 03:18:19.479 align:start position:0%
affirmatively about who their agent is
 
03:18:21.550 --> 03:18:21.560 align:start position:0%
and in the case of the living will um
 
03:18:24.510 --> 03:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
what uh what they would want um you know
 
03:18:25.630 --> 03:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
in the event that they were unable to
 
03:18:28.229 --> 03:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
make healthc care decisions for
 
03:18:31.429 --> 03:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
themselves um you've already heard about
 
03:18:33.269 --> 03:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
the uh clinical trial and experimental
 
03:18:34.910 --> 03:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
treatment provision and the importance
 
03:18:37.830 --> 03:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
of those um I think the legislation also
 
03:18:39.229 --> 03:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
takes account of the fact you've heard
 
03:18:40.630 --> 03:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
about this as well that there are now a
 
03:18:42.830 --> 03:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
wide variety of types of documents in
 
03:18:45.150 --> 03:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
use by which an individual can express
 
03:18:47.309 --> 03:18:47.319 align:start position:0%
preferences about their care and it
 
03:18:49.710 --> 03:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
makes clear that an agent or surrogate
 
03:18:52.110 --> 03:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
um is is required to honor and respect
 
03:18:53.950 --> 03:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
those Express preferences whether they
 
03:18:56.110 --> 03:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
are in the living will or in a different
 
03:19:00.349 --> 03:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
document or or orally um and the couple
 
03:19:02.269 --> 03:19:02.279 align:start position:0%
of other things about the legislation um
 
03:19:04.030 --> 03:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
it cleans up inconsistent uses of
 
03:19:06.070 --> 03:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
language and inconsistent terms that had
 
03:19:08.309 --> 03:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
crept into the statute as well as
 
03:19:11.349 --> 03:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
redundancies as a res as a result of
 
03:19:14.269 --> 03:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
Prior piece meal changes um it also
 
03:19:15.750 --> 03:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
allows for the virtual witnessing of
 
03:19:17.550 --> 03:19:17.560 align:start position:0%
advanced directives and while we expect
 
03:19:19.229 --> 03:19:19.239 align:start position:0%
that the vast majority of individuals
 
03:19:21.469 --> 03:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
will continue to sign these directives
 
03:19:24.790 --> 03:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
before two live Witnesses or a notary um
 
03:19:26.469 --> 03:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
as historically has been the case the
 
03:19:28.950 --> 03:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
statute does enable those um who are not
 
03:19:30.429 --> 03:19:30.439 align:start position:0%
able to do that perhaps because they're
 
03:19:32.030 --> 03:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
homebound or otherwise unable to
 
03:19:33.790 --> 03:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
assemble Witnesses or a notary with them
 
03:19:35.790 --> 03:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
in person to be able to execute
 
03:19:38.030 --> 03:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
directives with remote witnessing um and
 
03:19:39.950 --> 03:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
that's something that has been happening
 
03:19:43.150 --> 03:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic in other contexts um
 
03:19:44.710 --> 03:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
as a result originally the executive
 
03:19:46.710 --> 03:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
order and then subsequently um
 
03:19:48.670 --> 03:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
legislation and I know those of us in
 
03:19:50.710 --> 03:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
the estate planning field um while it
 
03:19:52.830 --> 03:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
has not substituted for uh in-person
 
03:19:55.510 --> 03:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
signings which remain um you know an
 
03:19:57.469 --> 03:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
important and primary part of how how
 
03:19:59.910 --> 03:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
this takes place um in in situations
 
03:20:01.429 --> 03:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
where they're necessary it's very
 
03:20:04.550 --> 03:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
helpful um and finally uh the
 
03:20:06.229 --> 03:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
legislation as you've heard updates the
 
03:20:08.630 --> 03:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
surgy statute so that those individuals
 
03:20:10.389 --> 03:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
who have not chosen agents which I think
 
03:20:11.990 --> 03:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
is actually a majority of folks in New
 
03:20:14.110 --> 03:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will be able to have a person
 
03:20:16.269 --> 03:20:16.279 align:start position:0%
empowered to make medical decisions uh
 
03:20:18.070 --> 03:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
while still maintaining important limits
 
03:20:20.229 --> 03:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
on that Authority um and the same
 
03:20:22.030 --> 03:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
guideline guidance and limitations that
 
03:20:24.189 --> 03:20:24.199 align:start position:0%
apply to agents will also apply to
 
03:20:26.630 --> 03:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
surgat um the authority of a serate will
 
03:20:29.590 --> 03:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
end after 180 days unless the patient is
 
03:20:31.750 --> 03:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
determining determined to be actively
 
03:20:34.990 --> 03:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
dying um which you heard Gina balkus
 
03:20:36.590 --> 03:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
testify about earlier why that's
 
03:20:38.910 --> 03:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
important um and that's up from 90 days
 
03:20:41.469 --> 03:20:41.479 align:start position:0%
in current law um this was a carefully
 
03:20:43.710 --> 03:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
negoti iated balance which the folks
 
03:20:45.750 --> 03:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
involved felt allowed for surrogate
 
03:20:48.510 --> 03:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
decision making on um a short and
 
03:20:50.389 --> 03:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
medium-term basis and allowing for
 
03:20:52.550 --> 03:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
families to avoid needing to rush to get
 
03:20:54.710 --> 03:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
a guardianship um for purposes of making
 
03:20:56.630 --> 03:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
end of life decisions during what can
 
03:20:59.070 --> 03:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
what can already be a very difficult uh
 
03:21:01.510 --> 03:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
time in in one's life in one's family
 
03:21:03.710 --> 03:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
life um but also maintaining the limit
 
03:21:06.269 --> 03:21:06.279 align:start position:0%
on surrogacy um so that surrogacy does
 
03:21:08.750 --> 03:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
not become a long-term alternative to a
 
03:21:10.950 --> 03:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
guardianship um of the person where
 
03:21:12.469 --> 03:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
someone has not done an advanced
 
03:21:15.229 --> 03:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
directive um and the the law maintains
 
03:21:17.349 --> 03:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
existing protections that allow any
 
03:21:18.750 --> 03:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
interested person to pursue a
 
03:21:20.830 --> 03:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
guardianship petition at which point
 
03:21:22.309 --> 03:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
once appointed a court appointed
 
03:21:24.070 --> 03:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
Guardian would be able to act instead of
 
03:21:27.189 --> 03:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
a medical practitioner appointed
 
03:21:31.189 --> 03:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
surrogate um I I do want to address um
 
03:21:33.389 --> 03:21:33.399 align:start position:0%
um some of the questions that I heard um
 
03:21:35.349 --> 03:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
come up earlier and in earlier testimony
 
03:21:38.070 --> 03:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
and earlier questions um some of these
 
03:21:39.910 --> 03:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
have been addressed by others um but I
 
03:21:40.990 --> 03:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
think there's a few we haven't really
 
03:21:43.710 --> 03:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
gotten to yet um so one is uh what
 
03:21:46.030 --> 03:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
appears at the bottom of page six of the
 
03:21:51.030 --> 03:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
bill um it's in uh J5 Roman 4 um this
 
03:21:54.389 --> 03:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
idea of um treatment uh against
 
03:21:57.550 --> 03:21:57.560 align:start position:0%
objection so in in New Hampshire law
 
03:22:01.150 --> 03:22:01.160 align:start position:0%
right now it provides that if one is
 
03:22:03.150 --> 03:22:03.160 align:start position:0%
incapacitated um and objects to
 
03:22:05.830 --> 03:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
treatment treatment may not be given
 
03:22:08.229 --> 03:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
over their objection unless there there
 
03:22:09.830 --> 03:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
is an affirmative statement in the
 
03:22:12.229 --> 03:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
advanced directive authorizing it and
 
03:22:14.429 --> 03:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
this provision which as far as I know is
 
03:22:16.189 --> 03:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
very unusual I don't know that any other
 
03:22:18.870 --> 03:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
states have this sort of provision um
 
03:22:21.870 --> 03:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
can make it very difficult when you have
 
03:22:24.269 --> 03:22:24.279 align:start position:0%
an individual who has been determined by
 
03:22:26.150 --> 03:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
their physician to be incapable of
 
03:22:28.550 --> 03:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
making medical decisions for themselves
 
03:22:31.590 --> 03:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
and does have an agent acting um but who
 
03:22:31.600 --> 03:22:33.269 align:start position:0%
and does have an agent acting um but who
nevertheless

03:22:33.269 --> 03:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
nevertheless
 
03:22:35.510 --> 03:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
articulates um you know a verbal
 
03:22:37.830 --> 03:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
objection uh to to and that could be
 
03:22:39.630 --> 03:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
either to treatment or to the lack of
 
03:22:41.870 --> 03:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
you know to a lack of treatment um and
 
03:22:43.510 --> 03:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
regardless even if those objections are
 
03:22:46.229 --> 03:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
entirely um incoherent or not in
 
03:22:48.229 --> 03:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
someone's interest you know the the way
 
03:22:50.750 --> 03:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
the law is is worded right now um they
 
03:22:52.510 --> 03:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
have to be honored or respected and then
 
03:22:55.150 --> 03:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
the only um real option is to go to
 
03:22:56.830 --> 03:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
court and get a guardianship so someone
 
03:22:59.070 --> 03:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
has the power to override those in
 
03:23:00.469 --> 03:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
addition because of that there are a
 
03:23:03.510 --> 03:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
number of facilities in our state um
 
03:23:06.150 --> 03:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
particularly facilities um that treat uh
 
03:23:08.110 --> 03:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
patients with uh you know severe
 
03:23:10.590 --> 03:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
Dementia or that have memory care units
 
03:23:12.990 --> 03:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
who if if there's an Advanced Directive
 
03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
and the the no box is checked meaning no
 
03:23:17.349 --> 03:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
I do not authorize treatment over my
 
03:23:19.590 --> 03:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
objection will
 
03:23:22.790 --> 03:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
require the um agent to go to court and
 
03:23:25.150 --> 03:23:25.160 align:start position:0%
get a guardianship before they'll admit
 
03:23:27.750 --> 03:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
someone under the agent's Authority be
 
03:23:29.510 --> 03:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
their reasoning being well if the if the
 
03:23:31.429 --> 03:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
patient says you know take me home I
 
03:23:33.630 --> 03:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
want to go home you know I want to sign
 
03:23:35.710 --> 03:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
myself out the agent would have no
 
03:23:38.150 --> 03:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
ability to consent to the individual
 
03:23:40.309 --> 03:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
staying in the facility um and so a lot
 
03:23:41.910 --> 03:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
of facilities are not willing to take
 
03:23:43.910 --> 03:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
that risk even if that's not a a present
 
03:23:46.150 --> 03:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
issue I have found in my practice when I
 
03:23:48.030 --> 03:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
explain to folks the implications of
 
03:23:49.389 --> 03:23:49.399 align:start position:0%
this and the implications of this
 
03:23:53.269 --> 03:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
question um I'd say well over 80% choose
 
03:23:55.389 --> 03:23:55.399 align:start position:0%
to allow treatment over their objection
 
03:23:57.309 --> 03:23:57.319 align:start position:0%
meaning to allow the agent to make the
 
03:24:00.309 --> 03:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
final decision um and so you know the
 
03:24:03.229 --> 03:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
agent under j6 is required to listen to
 
03:24:05.030 --> 03:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
the principle required to adhere to
 
03:24:07.150 --> 03:24:07.160 align:start position:0%
their wishes however expressed in
 
03:24:10.070 --> 03:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
writing or orally um and so we felt on
 
03:24:11.670 --> 03:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
balance you know there was adequate
 
03:24:14.630 --> 03:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
protection for uh patients wishes being
 
03:24:17.309 --> 03:24:17.319 align:start position:0%
honored um while still not putting
 
03:24:20.309 --> 03:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
individuals who need medical care um and
 
03:24:23.189 --> 03:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
their agents in in a difficult position
 
03:24:27.110 --> 03:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
um that said the uh I heard testimony
 
03:24:28.150 --> 03:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
saying well no you know you don't you
 
03:24:29.469 --> 03:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
don't even know that now when you sign
 
03:24:31.269 --> 03:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
the form and that that is not the case
 
03:24:33.710 --> 03:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
um at the top of page 16 in the
 
03:24:36.030 --> 03:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
disclosure statement it explains that
 
03:24:38.070 --> 03:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
you know you can add that back in that
 
03:24:40.750 --> 03:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
you can put that limit on your agent um
 
03:24:42.309 --> 03:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
if you wish to do so and again in my
 
03:24:44.429 --> 03:24:44.439 align:start position:0%
experience it's it's well under 20% of
 
03:24:46.710 --> 03:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
individuals who who want that limitation
 
03:24:51.030 --> 03:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
in there um we uh heard questions about
 
03:24:52.550 --> 03:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
removing the rights of hospitals and
 
03:24:54.510 --> 03:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
Facilities to opt out and I think as was
 
03:24:56.309 --> 03:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
pointed out at both the bottom of page
 
03:24:59.229 --> 03:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
nine and at the top of page 10 there is
 
03:25:01.469 --> 03:25:01.479 align:start position:0%
language in the bill that acknowledges
 
03:25:03.429 --> 03:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
you know how that works requires
 
03:25:05.710 --> 03:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
transfer both for the individual
 
03:25:07.429 --> 03:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
practitioner at the bottom of page nine
 
03:25:09.670 --> 03:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
in Roman 2 and then in what will be New
 
03:25:12.710 --> 03:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
Roman 3 at the on page 10 and um
 
03:25:14.469 --> 03:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
addressing the healthc care provider or
 
03:25:17.269 --> 03:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
residential care provider um being able
 
03:25:22.469 --> 03:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
to opt out um there was a uh question um
 
03:25:23.950 --> 03:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
I think from representative kushman
 
03:25:25.670 --> 03:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
about will people need to complete new
 
03:25:30.429 --> 03:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
forms um 137 j16 in the existing statute
 
03:25:34.030 --> 03:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
which is not being amended by S SP 74 um
 
03:25:36.590 --> 03:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
said referring to documents executed
 
03:25:39.030 --> 03:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
prior to enactment says nothing in this
 
03:25:40.830 --> 03:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
chapter limits the enforceability of an
 
03:25:42.429 --> 03:25:42.439 align:start position:0%
advanced Direct Ive or similar
 
03:25:45.030 --> 03:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
instrument validly executed under prior
 
03:25:47.830 --> 03:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law um that was considered
 
03:25:50.389 --> 03:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
and deliberately left in so that um we
 
03:25:52.150 --> 03:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
recognize that you know there there's
 
03:25:54.990 --> 03:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
going to be even if this bill passes you
 
03:25:57.189 --> 03:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
know the old form will probably remain
 
03:25:59.670 --> 03:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
in uh prevalent in circulation for at
 
03:26:01.110 --> 03:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
least the next decade and we want to
 
03:26:02.950 --> 03:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that you know individuals who
 
03:26:04.349 --> 03:26:04.359 align:start position:0%
have done these forms in the past and
 
03:26:06.070 --> 03:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
expressed their wishes will will
 
03:26:07.590 --> 03:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
obviously continue to have those wishes
 
03:26:09.429 --> 03:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
honored um and they can do a new form if
 
03:26:11.510 --> 03:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
they wish but no one's going to have to
 
03:26:13.110 --> 03:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
you know rush to their doctor or their
 
03:26:15.550 --> 03:26:15.560 align:start position:0%
PCP to to do a new form you know the day
 
03:26:20.309 --> 03:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
that this law passes if it does um I I
 
03:26:22.030 --> 03:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
believe that uh oh and then finally
 
03:26:23.389 --> 03:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
there was um representative Merchant
 
03:26:25.750 --> 03:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
your question about the um living will
 
03:26:27.590 --> 03:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
and could it be amended um I don't want
 
03:26:29.070 --> 03:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
to speak for the broader group I'd
 
03:26:31.630 --> 03:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
certainly be um you know willing to be
 
03:26:33.189 --> 03:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
part of a dialogue about that and I
 
03:26:34.950 --> 03:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
think that would be helpful the one
 
03:26:37.429 --> 03:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
thing I can say is we did consider
 
03:26:40.590 --> 03:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
having a separate section of the form
 
03:26:43.110 --> 03:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
relating to experimental treatment given
 
03:26:45.030 --> 03:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
the various options that the statute
 
03:26:47.469 --> 03:26:47.479 align:start position:0%
gives and ultimately decided against
 
03:26:50.510 --> 03:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
that for the reason that um the the
 
03:26:52.110 --> 03:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
medical practitioners in the group
 
03:26:53.710 --> 03:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
advise us that this is a you know a
 
03:26:56.229 --> 03:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
fairly rare circumstance when this comes
 
03:26:58.950 --> 03:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
into um when this becomes relevant for
 
03:27:01.469 --> 03:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
an individual and the more questions the
 
03:27:04.990 --> 03:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
more sections we add to the form um you
 
03:27:06.830 --> 03:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
know the more confusing it becomes the
 
03:27:08.830 --> 03:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
less likely it is somebody successfully
 
03:27:11.429 --> 03:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
completes the entire form and so our
 
03:27:14.189 --> 03:27:14.199 align:start position:0%
goal was really to to keep the form as
 
03:27:16.510 --> 03:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
simple as possible to maximize the
 
03:27:18.309 --> 03:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
chance that someone can complete it and
 
03:27:20.550 --> 03:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
complete it accurately and reflecting
 
03:27:23.110 --> 03:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
their wishes while um you know putting
 
03:27:25.309 --> 03:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
in the disclosure statement itself which
 
03:27:28.309 --> 03:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
is required to be with the form uh the
 
03:27:30.550 --> 03:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
various other options and explanations
 
03:27:33.110 --> 03:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
so on page 16 in the disclosure
 
03:27:35.510 --> 03:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
statement it says the law allows your
 
03:27:37.510 --> 03:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
agent to put you in a clinical trial or
 
03:27:40.389 --> 03:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
to agree to new or experimental
 
03:27:43.950 --> 03:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
treatment um and you know and states the
 
03:27:45.870 --> 03:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
conditions that are the default and then
 
03:27:47.790 --> 03:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
says you may change this by writing in
 
03:27:49.790 --> 03:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
the form and then there's two options
 
03:27:52.590 --> 03:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
below um and so you know rather than
 
03:27:53.990 --> 03:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
having that be a separate section of the
 
03:27:56.349 --> 03:27:56.359 align:start position:0%
form that's how we decided to address it
 
03:27:59.030 --> 03:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
I do see um representative Merchant what
 
03:28:01.030 --> 03:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
your you know your comment about why you
 
03:28:02.830 --> 03:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
know in the living will having that
 
03:28:06.630 --> 03:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
language in a might be um inadvertently
 
03:28:08.910 --> 03:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
read to limit um someone's ability to
 
03:28:10.710 --> 03:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
consent to experimental treatment I
 
03:28:12.630 --> 03:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
would point out the living will is not
 
03:28:14.229 --> 03:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
legally binding it's designed as
 
03:28:15.990 --> 03:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
guidance and I do think the law the
 
03:28:17.790 --> 03:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
statute itself and the disclosure form
 
03:28:20.070 --> 03:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
makes clear what the agents Authority is
 
03:28:21.469 --> 03:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
in this respect but I'd certainly be
 
03:28:24.030 --> 03:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
open to a a dialogue about you know can
 
03:28:25.389 --> 03:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
this be made even clearer because
 
03:28:27.910 --> 03:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
obviously bringing in um questions from
 
03:28:29.990 --> 03:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
folks seeing this for the first time um
 
03:28:31.950 --> 03:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
it's always helpful to to step back and
 
03:28:33.830 --> 03:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
reconsider um you know could another
 
03:28:36.349 --> 03:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
tweak be made because uh you know we we
 
03:28:37.750 --> 03:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
we tried very hard and we spent many
 
03:28:39.630 --> 03:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
hours but I'm I'm sure we didn't get it
 
03:28:41.790 --> 03:28:41.800 align:start position:0%
done perfectly um
 
03:28:43.670 --> 03:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for for listening and I'm
 
03:28:45.389 --> 03:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
03:28:47.790 --> 03:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr hman I think it's
 
03:28:49.630 --> 03:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
very helpful for the committee to know
 
03:28:51.590 --> 03:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
the time and effort and compromises that
 
03:28:54.309 --> 03:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
went into preparing this bill do we have
 
03:28:55.870 --> 03:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
03:29:00.309 --> 03:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
Hol go ahead thank you chairman um Mr
 
03:29:03.070 --> 03:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
Helman thank you for taking my question
 
03:29:06.630 --> 03:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
um this is a really simple one but these
 
03:29:09.710 --> 03:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
are the kinds of things we get asked uh
 
03:29:12.309 --> 03:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
that earlier people spoke to uh
 
03:29:14.389 --> 03:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
workshops that have happened where
 
03:29:17.710 --> 03:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
people can go to and get guidance on how
 
03:29:20.309 --> 03:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
to fill out these forms and they want to
 
03:29:22.510 --> 03:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
just fill them out right then and there
 
03:29:27.269 --> 03:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
and um but this is a legal document uh
 
03:29:29.750 --> 03:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
what if a person shows up at the
 
03:29:31.830 --> 03:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
hospital because they haven't gotten to
 
03:29:33.870 --> 03:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
the lawyer yet turned it into a legal
 
03:29:35.510 --> 03:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
document but they've got it all written
 
03:29:38.269 --> 03:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
out by hand would that have any standing
 
03:29:38.279 --> 03:29:40.110 align:start position:0%
out by hand would that have any standing
at

03:29:40.110 --> 03:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:29:40.120 --> 03:29:43.630 align:start position:0%
at
all

03:29:43.630 --> 03:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:45.710 --> 03:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
yes I mean there is no the document
 
03:29:48.110 --> 03:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be either witnessed by two
 
03:29:50.110 --> 03:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
individuals or notorized so something
 
03:29:52.990 --> 03:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
that someone has purely handwritten um
 
03:29:54.990 --> 03:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
you know wouldn't qualify legally as an
 
03:29:58.030 --> 03:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
advanced directive that said um if they
 
03:30:01.070 --> 03:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
had an agent or or a surrogate appointed
 
03:30:02.429 --> 03:30:02.439 align:start position:0%
um under
 
03:30:06.189 --> 03:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
137 j6 um you know there is a
 
03:30:07.910 --> 03:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
requirement that the agent or surrogate
 
03:30:09.790 --> 03:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
make Healthcare decisions in accordance
 
03:30:11.630 --> 03:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
with their knowledge of the principal
 
03:30:14.469 --> 03:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
wishes and religious or moral beliefs as
 
03:30:17.510 --> 03:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
stated orally in writing or otherwise
 
03:30:19.750 --> 03:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
communicated by the principal um and
 
03:30:21.429 --> 03:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
then if those wishes are unknown in
 
03:30:23.070 --> 03:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
accordance with their assessment of best
 
03:30:24.269 --> 03:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
interests and in accordance with
 
03:30:26.349 --> 03:30:26.359 align:start position:0%
accepted medical practice so I think in
 
03:30:29.189 --> 03:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
that case you refer um you know if I was
 
03:30:31.469 --> 03:30:31.479 align:start position:0%
uh I don't generally advise hospitals um
 
03:30:33.269 --> 03:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
but if if if I was if I had a hospital
 
03:30:34.630 --> 03:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
with my client saying you know can the
 
03:30:36.429 --> 03:30:36.439 align:start position:0%
agent honor this can this be honored I
 
03:30:41.349 --> 03:30:41.359 align:start position:0%
would say absolutely because um the that
 
03:30:43.030 --> 03:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
that's the principal's communication you
 
03:30:44.070 --> 03:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
know as long as there weren't questions
 
03:30:45.910 --> 03:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
about authenticity but that's the
 
03:30:48.670 --> 03:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
principal's communication and under j6
 
03:30:50.910 --> 03:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
you know the agent or surrogate uh would
 
03:30:52.150 --> 03:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
need to honor
 
03:30:55.990 --> 03:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
it follow thank you um and that
 
03:31:00.710 --> 03:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
surrogate can be um assigned
 
03:31:00.720 --> 03:31:02.229 align:start position:0%
surrogate can be um assigned
by

03:31:02.229 --> 03:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:31:02.239 --> 03:31:04.870 align:start position:0%
by
the

03:31:04.870 --> 03:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:31:07.790 --> 03:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
caregiver uh by that I'm I'm looking for
 
03:31:09.670 --> 03:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
the list of possible people that they
 
03:31:13.030 --> 03:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
could pick from starting 25 yeah
 
03:31:16.550 --> 03:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
starting with closest relatives so um
 
03:31:22.269 --> 03:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
say cousin uh Sally knows um knows me
 
03:31:24.950 --> 03:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
really well and and saw me write this
 
03:31:28.349 --> 03:31:28.359 align:start position:0%
out and we talked about it um and the
 
03:31:30.590 --> 03:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
doctor said hey she seems to know you
 
03:31:32.670 --> 03:31:32.680 align:start position:0%
well you seem to know her well you can
 
03:31:33.790 --> 03:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
be a
 
03:31:36.309 --> 03:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
surrogate and then then it would have
 
03:31:39.189 --> 03:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
some impact then for the surrogate to
 
03:31:41.550 --> 03:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
say no look we've already we've
 
03:31:43.309 --> 03:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
discussed these things and written them
 
03:31:45.349 --> 03:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
down it just wasn't signed by an
 
03:31:47.790 --> 03:31:47.800 align:start position:0%
attorney or a
 
03:31:50.309 --> 03:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
notary exactly right so if there was no
 
03:31:52.510 --> 03:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
valid appointment of an agent you know
 
03:31:55.349 --> 03:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
no formal document designating an agent
 
03:31:57.189 --> 03:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
then the surrogacy statute would come
 
03:31:59.790 --> 03:31:59.800 align:start position:0%
into play and you have that order that
 
03:32:03.910 --> 03:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
hierarchical order um in the statute um
 
03:32:07.469 --> 03:32:07.479 align:start position:0%
and then the once that person is
 
03:32:09.389 --> 03:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
designated formally as the decision
 
03:32:11.189 --> 03:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
maker they are then charged with
 
03:32:13.670 --> 03:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
adhering to you know all of those things
 
03:32:15.950 --> 03:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
I referenced in j6 so yes I think
 
03:32:19.070 --> 03:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
practically if um you know if this
 
03:32:21.030 --> 03:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
person is the closest person and there
 
03:32:24.070 --> 03:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
isn't a you know a higher level you know
 
03:32:26.269 --> 03:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
spouse or an adult child or parent you
 
03:32:28.349 --> 03:32:28.359 align:start position:0%
know who can come in then and and we get
 
03:32:30.349 --> 03:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
to that level and it even it even goes
 
03:32:32.870 --> 03:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
down to friends so it doesn't have to be
 
03:32:35.590 --> 03:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
um even a relative uh you know that the
 
03:32:37.349 --> 03:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
idea of the surrogacy statute is that
 
03:32:39.150 --> 03:32:39.160 align:start position:0%
person can then you know be the one who
 
03:32:41.670 --> 03:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
makes decisions in the event a family
 
03:32:43.510 --> 03:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
conflict where you have more than one
 
03:32:45.510 --> 03:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
person who is claiming to speak for the
 
03:32:47.150 --> 03:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
principal that's when you're going to
 
03:32:48.349 --> 03:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
have to go to court and get a
 
03:32:50.830 --> 03:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
guardianship um but let's say even in
 
03:32:52.389 --> 03:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
the situation you described say you had
 
03:32:54.229 --> 03:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
a you know someone who was higher up on
 
03:32:55.790 --> 03:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
the list who didn't you know who the
 
03:32:57.269 --> 03:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
cousin said well they don't know them as
 
03:32:58.950 --> 03:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
well you know I should really be the
 
03:33:00.990 --> 03:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
decision maker here the cousin could
 
03:33:02.710 --> 03:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
still go and petition for Guardianship
 
03:33:05.630 --> 03:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
and argue to a probate judge that really
 
03:33:07.189 --> 03:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
they should be the decision maker not
 
03:33:08.990 --> 03:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
the adult child who hasn't been involved
 
03:33:11.189 --> 03:33:11.199 align:start position:0%
in their life for 20 years and that's a
 
03:33:12.990 --> 03:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
decision that you know the the medical
 
03:33:14.110 --> 03:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
practitioner is not going to be in a
 
03:33:15.590 --> 03:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
good position to make but that's why we
 
03:33:17.990 --> 03:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
have probate courts and probate judges
 
03:33:20.189 --> 03:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
who can assess and make you know a
 
03:33:21.469 --> 03:33:21.479 align:start position:0%
decision that they feel is in the best
 
03:33:24.030 --> 03:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
interest of the of the individual thank
 
03:33:27.750 --> 03:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
you for clarifying that very good
 
03:33:29.030 --> 03:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
questions from Mr
 
03:33:32.269 --> 03:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
H yes
 
03:33:35.790 --> 03:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
represent thank you uh I have a question
 
03:33:39.150 --> 03:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
on the concerning overriding of patients
 
03:33:41.710 --> 03:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
wishes so you you gave the example of
 
03:33:43.950 --> 03:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
someone who has advanced dementia and
 
03:33:46.950 --> 03:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
that the need for this override to be in
 
03:33:51.150 --> 03:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
the bill came from uh policies of uh
 
03:33:54.550 --> 03:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
Memory Care units and the like of
 
03:33:57.830 --> 03:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
requiring family members to go get a
 
03:34:00.550 --> 03:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
guardianship um I have a little trouble
 
03:34:03.510 --> 03:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
with taking that up because I I sort of
 
03:34:05.349 --> 03:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
think that it should be required to go
 
03:34:07.429 --> 03:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
to court to override a patient's wishes
 
03:34:11.389 --> 03:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
wishes could you expound on um why you
 
03:34:14.990 --> 03:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
would believe it's appropriate to not
 
03:34:19.429 --> 03:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
require a more serious and thorough
 
03:34:24.229 --> 03:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:26.469 --> 03:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
guardianship um yes thank you for the
 
03:34:28.630 --> 03:34:28.640 align:start position:0%
question representative kushman um you
 
03:34:31.510 --> 03:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
know I I think what the way I would
 
03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
think about it is for my perspective at
 
03:34:37.110 --> 03:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
least is um you know what is the way
 
03:34:40.030 --> 03:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
that the legislature can best honor
 
03:34:43.309 --> 03:34:43.319 align:start position:0%
individual preferences and in my
 
03:34:45.070 --> 03:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
experience the vast majority of
 
03:34:47.189 --> 03:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
individuals who complete an advanced
 
03:34:50.750 --> 03:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
directive do so because they want
 
03:34:52.710 --> 03:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
another individual to be able to make
 
03:34:55.750 --> 03:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
decisions for them a trusted uh you know
 
03:34:57.950 --> 03:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
family member or close friend to be able
 
03:34:59.830 --> 03:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
to make decisions for them in the event
 
03:35:01.070 --> 03:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
that they've been determined that
 
03:35:02.990 --> 03:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
they're not able to make decisions for
 
03:35:04.870 --> 03:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
themselves so I I think there are number
 
03:35:06.750 --> 03:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
of safeguards one is that the whole
 
03:35:09.349 --> 03:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
Advanced Directive is not in place
 
03:35:11.990 --> 03:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
unless uh you know unless one's
 
03:35:14.950 --> 03:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
practitioner has determined based on you
 
03:35:16.510 --> 03:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
know the prevailing medical standard
 
03:35:19.790 --> 03:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
that this individual is not does not
 
03:35:21.630 --> 03:35:21.640 align:start position:0%
have capacity to make decisions for
 
03:35:22.990 --> 03:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
themselves so if someone has capacity to
 
03:35:25.389 --> 03:35:25.399 align:start position:0%
make decisions for themselves it doesn't
 
03:35:26.630 --> 03:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
matter what they've put in the document
 
03:35:27.790 --> 03:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
you know they're the ones making the
 
03:35:30.309 --> 03:35:30.319 align:start position:0%
decisions but if we're in that box where
 
03:35:31.910 --> 03:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
the document has been activated and
 
03:35:34.910 --> 03:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
individual is making decisions um you
 
03:35:36.550 --> 03:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
know the vast majority of people want
 
03:35:37.990 --> 03:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
that individual to be able to make
 
03:35:40.229 --> 03:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
decisions for them even contrary to what
 
03:35:43.349 --> 03:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
they are are expressing at the time for
 
03:35:45.309 --> 03:35:45.319 align:start position:0%
those people who do not feel that way
 
03:35:47.550 --> 03:35:47.560 align:start position:0%
who say no I do not you know it makes me
 
03:35:49.269 --> 03:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable I do not want to give up
 
03:35:51.469 --> 03:35:51.479 align:start position:0%
that level of autonomy even if a
 
03:35:52.950 --> 03:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
doctor's determined that I can't make
 
03:35:54.750 --> 03:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
decisions you know I don't trust that I
 
03:35:57.070 --> 03:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
I still want whatever I express verbally
 
03:36:00.030 --> 03:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
to be honored the form and the law still
 
03:36:03.269 --> 03:36:03.279 align:start position:0%
allows for that so they can still put in
 
03:36:04.790 --> 03:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
their durable power of attorney for
 
03:36:07.189 --> 03:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
healthcare no you know my agent cannot
 
03:36:10.590 --> 03:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
make decisions over my expressed obje
 
03:36:14.590 --> 03:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
ction or you know if I if I articulate
 
03:36:16.269 --> 03:36:16.279 align:start position:0%
the decision that I want even if I've
 
03:36:18.750 --> 03:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
been found incapacitated my agent can't
 
03:36:20.510 --> 03:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
make a decision to the contrary you know
 
03:36:23.830 --> 03:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
without going to court I'd say finally
 
03:36:27.670 --> 03:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
even for individuals who um have
 
03:36:29.110 --> 03:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
expressed you know the view that they
 
03:36:32.950 --> 03:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
want an override um to be able to happen
 
03:36:35.030 --> 03:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know in that in but I'm deeming
 
03:36:37.389 --> 03:36:37.399 align:start position:0%
sort of like the 80% of of New Hampshire
 
03:36:40.510 --> 03:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
folks that I've interacted with uh if
 
03:36:42.150 --> 03:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
you then got to the point where they
 
03:36:43.710 --> 03:36:43.720 align:start position:0%
felt like their agent was acting
 
03:36:45.830 --> 03:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
contrary to their interests you know
 
03:36:47.389 --> 03:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
they or another family member could
 
03:36:49.150 --> 03:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
always petition the probate court I mean
 
03:36:51.469 --> 03:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
if they have capacity they could revoke
 
03:36:54.349 --> 03:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
the directive um if they didn't have
 
03:36:56.429 --> 03:36:56.439 align:start position:0%
capacity um and again we sort of
 
03:36:57.910 --> 03:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
assuming that if it's activated that
 
03:36:59.229 --> 03:36:59.239 align:start position:0%
that at least their doctors determin
 
03:37:02.229 --> 03:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
they don't have capacity um either they
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
individually or with the assistance of a
 
03:37:05.510 --> 03:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
family member or friend nevertheless
 
03:37:08.590 --> 03:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
could petition the probate court to um
 
03:37:11.750 --> 03:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
have their directive voked and so and or
 
03:37:14.389 --> 03:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
have somebody else appointed so to me
 
03:37:16.309 --> 03:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's a question of both preserving
 
03:37:18.229 --> 03:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
autonomy for the individuals who want to
 
03:37:20.030 --> 03:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
make that decision while also not
 
03:37:23.110 --> 03:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
putting the vast majority of people in a
 
03:37:24.670 --> 03:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
position where like they've named an
 
03:37:26.189 --> 03:37:26.199 align:start position:0%
agent and they think that agent can make
 
03:37:28.349 --> 03:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
decisions for them but in fact there's
 
03:37:29.790 --> 03:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
this limit that they didn't really
 
03:37:31.710 --> 03:37:31.720 align:start position:0%
understand or contemplate um and now the
 
03:37:35.070 --> 03:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:38.070 --> 03:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
guardianship have follow you may have a
 
03:37:40.150 --> 03:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
follow thank you for answering my
 
03:37:42.189 --> 03:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
question question um I believe that you
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
alluded to that that um it's disclosed
 
03:37:49.510 --> 03:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
in the disclosure um but I that they
 
03:37:50.510 --> 03:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
have the
 
03:37:53.670 --> 03:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
option um to explicitly state that they
 
03:37:57.269 --> 03:37:57.279 align:start position:0%
don't want their their
 
03:38:02.790 --> 03:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
um desires overridden by an agent but is
 
03:38:06.110 --> 03:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
there I believe this bill and so can you
 
03:38:08.630 --> 03:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
tell me if this bill removes the
 
03:38:10.630 --> 03:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
requirement to make sure that the
 
03:38:14.590 --> 03:38:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:16.950 --> 03:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
disclosure yeah so I think I understand
 
03:38:19.950 --> 03:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
the question so just to point out um for
 
03:38:21.349 --> 03:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
clarification where it is in the
 
03:38:24.030 --> 03:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
disclosure it's um the bottom of page 15
 
03:38:27.389 --> 03:38:27.399 align:start position:0%
and the top of page 16 the bottom of 15
 
03:38:29.990 --> 03:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
says you know with few exceptions your
 
03:38:31.750 --> 03:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
agent will make decisions for you when
 
03:38:33.750 --> 03:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
you're unable to make them for yourself
 
03:38:35.389 --> 03:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
and some people do not want to allow
 
03:38:37.710 --> 03:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
their agent to make some decisions and
 
03:38:40.309 --> 03:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
you can write in um and then the last WR
 
03:38:42.469 --> 03:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
WR in item which is lines 5 to six on
 
03:38:45.150 --> 03:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
page 16 says to agree to treatment even
 
03:38:46.670 --> 03:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
if I object to it in the moment after
 
03:38:48.670 --> 03:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
I've lost the ability to make Healthcare
 
03:38:50.349 --> 03:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
decisions for myself um so I just want
 
03:38:52.309 --> 03:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
to clarify that that's where it is
 
03:38:56.590 --> 03:38:56.600 align:start position:0%
getting um to the specific
 
03:38:56.600 --> 03:38:58.670 align:start position:0%
getting um to the specific
question

03:38:58.670 --> 03:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:39:00.710 --> 03:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
um you know and then the form itself
 
03:39:02.309 --> 03:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
says you can write in you can write in
 
03:39:04.790 --> 03:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
limits um and I'm sorry now that I went
 
03:39:06.110 --> 03:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
on the tangent I forgot your specific
 
03:39:07.590 --> 03:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
question do you mind articulating it
 
03:39:09.870 --> 03:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
again I'm sorry okay I know that the
 
03:39:12.590 --> 03:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
form itself says you can write in your
 
03:39:16.910 --> 03:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
own um your own instructions but it
 
03:39:20.309 --> 03:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't say explicitly you can write
 
03:39:23.790 --> 03:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
what the disclosure mentions and is
 
03:39:26.870 --> 03:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
there a provision in the bill and on the
 
03:39:28.389 --> 03:39:28.399 align:start position:0%
form that
 
03:39:32.469 --> 03:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
requires the person signing the form to
 
03:39:34.429 --> 03:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
read the
 
03:39:37.030 --> 03:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
disclosure ah I understand does is there
 
03:39:39.830 --> 03:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
I I get the question so the statute used
 
03:39:41.830 --> 03:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
the current statute requires that the
 
03:39:44.550 --> 03:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
disclosure be
 
03:39:49.710 --> 03:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
signed um we uh removed that provision
 
03:39:53.389 --> 03:39:53.399 align:start position:0%
in the proposed Bill and I'm on page 13
 
03:39:57.750 --> 03:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
lines 27 to 29 so we maintain the
 
03:40:00.070 --> 03:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
provision saying that every person
 
03:40:01.870 --> 03:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
wishing to execute an advanced directive
 
03:40:04.150 --> 03:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
shall be provided with the disclosure
 
03:40:06.630 --> 03:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
statement um but remove the provision
 
03:40:08.229 --> 03:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
saying that they're required to sign a
 
03:40:09.910 --> 03:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
statement acknowledging that they've
 
03:40:12.469 --> 03:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
received it and the reason why we
 
03:40:16.030 --> 03:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
proposed to remove that is because um
 
03:40:17.630 --> 03:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
you know we were trying to eliminate
 
03:40:20.030 --> 03:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
barriers to completing and and and
 
03:40:23.110 --> 03:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
making a valid Advanced Directive um and
 
03:40:25.670 --> 03:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
under current law an individual not only
 
03:40:27.710 --> 03:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
has to sign the disclosure statement
 
03:40:29.349 --> 03:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
they have to sign the durable power of
 
03:40:30.910 --> 03:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
attorney for healthcare and they have to
 
03:40:32.550 --> 03:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
sign the living will so in theory there
 
03:40:34.630 --> 03:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
were you know three separate places an
 
03:40:37.150 --> 03:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
individual had to sign and in the effort
 
03:40:40.189 --> 03:40:40.199 align:start position:0%
to make the document easier and not have
 
03:40:42.590 --> 03:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
have um sort of artificial legal
 
03:40:45.110 --> 03:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
barriers to completion we we said you
 
03:40:46.950 --> 03:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
know there's there's one we're going to
 
03:40:48.950 --> 03:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
have one signature place so there is not
 
03:40:51.870 --> 03:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
a separate Signature Place for the
 
03:40:53.870 --> 03:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
disclosure statement but there is still
 
03:40:56.189 --> 03:40:56.199 align:start position:0%
that affirmative requirement that the
 
03:40:58.510 --> 03:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
disclosure statement accompany the
 
03:40:58.520 --> 03:41:00.630 align:start position:0%
disclosure statement accompany the
advanced

03:41:00.630 --> 03:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
advanced
 
03:41:03.670 --> 03:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
directive could I
 
03:41:08.550 --> 03:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
speak who is this this is Bob Wells uh
 
03:41:11.229 --> 03:41:11.239 align:start position:0%
Mr Wells I will recognize you later if
 
03:41:14.110 --> 03:41:14.120 align:start position:0%
you raise your hand but I we don't let
 
03:41:15.910 --> 03:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
the public ask questions of members of
 
03:41:18.630 --> 03:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
the public that's uh not the way the
 
03:41:20.670 --> 03:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
committee are do you have any further
 
03:41:22.710 --> 03:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
followups are you
 
03:41:26.790 --> 03:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
done um I'm just wondering if the
 
03:41:28.870 --> 03:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the bill I guess it's for
 
03:41:30.910 --> 03:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
the sponsor
 
03:41:32.670 --> 03:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
03:41:37.469 --> 03:41:37.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:40.469 --> 03:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
H um I guess I would just add if I may
 
03:41:42.149 --> 03:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
representative kushman I mean certainly
 
03:41:43.229 --> 03:41:43.239 align:start position:0%
you know as I said there were a lot of
 
03:41:44.870 --> 03:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
decisions and compromises that went into
 
03:41:46.670 --> 03:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
this but if if a group does get convened
 
03:41:48.110 --> 03:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
to discuss some of the concerns that
 
03:41:51.510 --> 03:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
have been addressed and you feel that
 
03:41:53.110 --> 03:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
having a separate Signature Place for
 
03:41:54.429 --> 03:41:54.439 align:start position:0%
the disclosure statement is something
 
03:41:56.229 --> 03:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
that would allay that concern you know I
 
03:41:58.149 --> 03:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
think certainly all these things are
 
03:41:59.389 --> 03:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
open to discussion right you're the
 
03:42:00.910 --> 03:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
you're the legislators it's ultimately
 
03:42:02.710 --> 03:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
up to you you know what you wish to
 
03:42:04.750 --> 03:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
happen so I just I didn't want to I just
 
03:42:06.149 --> 03:42:06.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to give the answer as to why we
 
03:42:07.830 --> 03:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
made the decision but not to say that
 
03:42:09.469 --> 03:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
you know the concern isn't a valid one
 
03:42:11.790 --> 03:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
or one that you know could be considered
 
03:42:11.800 --> 03:42:12.670 align:start position:0%
or one that you know could be considered
or

03:42:12.670 --> 03:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:42:17.110 --> 03:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
addressed take extra time thank you very
 
03:42:20.670 --> 03:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
much seeing no further hands Dr Lawson
 
03:42:23.149 --> 03:42:23.159 align:start position:0%
representative Weber you have a question
 
03:42:26.070 --> 03:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh my question is simply to ask the
 
03:42:29.070 --> 03:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
chair at the appropriate time to
 
03:42:33.750 --> 03:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
recognize uh Mr Wells who is a member of
 
03:42:37.149 --> 03:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
this rotating panel to ask answer to
 
03:42:39.630 --> 03:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
give his answer to the question that was
 
03:42:43.349 --> 03:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
just opposed to um
 
03:42:48.309 --> 03:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
Mr uh Hillman because he also had some
 
03:42:50.990 --> 03:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
clarification I believe the chair's
 
03:42:53.149 --> 03:42:53.159 align:start position:0%
intention was to recognize Dr Lawson and
 
03:42:54.870 --> 03:42:54.880 align:start position:0%

03:43:54.189 --> 03:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
volunteer time on this and is unable to
 
03:43:56.149 --> 03:43:56.159 align:start position:0%

Not Duplicate that but I did want to

focus on a couple things um number one
 
03:44:35.189 --> 03:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh represent of kushman in regards to an
 
03:44:37.750 --> 03:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
answer to your question the the bottom
 
03:44:39.750 --> 03:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
of the dpoa statement spefic
 
03:44:41.910 --> 03:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
specifically says please review the
 
03:44:43.830 --> 03:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
disclosure statement that is attached to
 
03:44:45.910 --> 03:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
this Advanced Directive for examples on
 
03:44:47.870 --> 03:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
how you might limit your agents
 
03:44:50.189 --> 03:44:50.199 align:start position:0%
Authority and we felt that in
 
03:44:54.469 --> 03:44:54.479 align:start position:0%
combination with the inclusion or necess
 
03:44:56.790 --> 03:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
necessity to include the disclosure
 
03:45:00.110 --> 03:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
statement um would be adequate for
 
03:45:03.110 --> 03:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
people who may want to uh have some
 
03:45:05.110 --> 03:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
limitations or have some questions in
 
03:45:07.590 --> 03:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
regards to how they might limit the
 
03:45:09.870 --> 03:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
durable power it's important to
 
03:45:12.070 --> 03:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
understand that all the issues around
 
03:45:14.790 --> 03:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
experimental treatment around uh
 
03:45:16.910 --> 03:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
treatment against objection the override
 
03:45:19.630 --> 03:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
Clause you're referring to these are all
 
03:45:22.950 --> 03:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
things where you're not making specific
 
03:45:24.429 --> 03:45:24.439 align:start position:0%
statements about what you want you're
 
03:45:26.429 --> 03:45:26.439 align:start position:0%
making specific statements about the
 
03:45:29.229 --> 03:45:29.239 align:start position:0%
authority you're giving to your durable
 
03:45:31.710 --> 03:45:31.720 align:start position:0%
power whether the durable power is going
 
03:45:34.110 --> 03:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to allow certain things or
 
03:45:36.550 --> 03:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
not um it's really important to
 
03:45:38.349 --> 03:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
understand and and Peter may be able to
 
03:45:40.309 --> 03:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
Peter ases may be able to State this
 
03:45:43.670 --> 03:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
year's data but of people who present a
 
03:45:46.469 --> 03:45:46.479 align:start position:0%
hospital it's well under 50% like high
 
03:45:49.590 --> 03:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
30s per who have an advanced
 
03:45:52.189 --> 03:45:52.199 align:start position:0%
directive the majority of the people we
 
03:45:54.070 --> 03:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
care for do not have an advanced
 
03:45:56.110 --> 03:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
directive do not come in and often come
 
03:45:58.830 --> 03:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
in without
 
03:46:02.070 --> 03:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
capacity and the law needs to address
 
03:46:05.550 --> 03:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
those people in respectful ways that can
 
03:46:08.590 --> 03:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
respect their best wishes as best we can
 
03:46:11.870 --> 03:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
understand them and as an example the
 
03:46:14.349 --> 03:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
treatment against objection Clause when
 
03:46:16.830 --> 03:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
the default is that they have to
 
03:46:19.429 --> 03:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
sign to allow treatment against
 
03:46:21.389 --> 03:46:21.399 align:start position:0%
objection in the
 
03:46:24.349 --> 03:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
moment that provides an incredible
 
03:46:27.510 --> 03:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
barrier to this wide range of
 
03:46:29.750 --> 03:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
exceedingly de you know demented
 
03:46:31.389 --> 03:46:31.399 align:start position:0%
Advanced dementia patients suffering
 
03:46:33.550 --> 03:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
from Advanced dementia Who present do do
 
03:46:35.309 --> 03:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
not have an advanced directive are
 
03:46:37.389 --> 03:46:37.399 align:start position:0%
swinging at the nurses pulling out their
 
03:46:41.469 --> 03:46:41.479 align:start position:0%
IVs highly agitated
 
03:46:43.630 --> 03:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
and this is every day in the hospital
 
03:46:45.750 --> 03:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know this is this is not an unusual
 
03:46:49.469 --> 03:46:49.479 align:start position:0%
thing this is every day and to not be
 
03:46:53.070 --> 03:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
able to treat them and to not allow the
 
03:46:56.510 --> 03:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
family to okay us giving medication to
 
03:46:59.110 --> 03:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
treat their agitation or to help calm
 
03:47:02.590 --> 03:47:02.600 align:start position:0%
them is abominable it's horrible we we
 
03:47:04.750 --> 03:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
can't legally do it you know honestly we
 
03:47:07.030 --> 03:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
do it anyway we take the legal risk but
 
03:47:11.349 --> 03:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
it's definitively against the law
 
03:47:14.349 --> 03:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
as it's stated and if we were to replace
 
03:47:14.359 --> 03:47:15.790 align:start position:0%
as it's stated and if we were to replace
that

03:47:15.790 --> 03:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:47:19.389 --> 03:47:19.399 align:start position:0%
default to force signing to to treat
 
03:47:21.990 --> 03:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
against objection we would be back in
 
03:47:23.950 --> 03:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
that state this is one of the most
 
03:47:26.790 --> 03:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
important improvements in my clinical
 
03:47:31.149 --> 03:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
opinion in the law uh is that adjustment
 
03:47:34.309 --> 03:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
to uh make the default the allowance for
 
03:47:36.309 --> 03:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
the durable power of attorney with the
 
03:47:39.070 --> 03:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
medical team to come up with the best
 
03:47:41.189 --> 03:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
possible approach to challenging
 
03:47:45.070 --> 03:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
situations as opposed to not allow any
 
03:47:47.910 --> 03:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
treatment against objection are multiple
 
03:47:49.990 --> 03:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
psychogeriatric patients who suffer from
 
03:47:53.670 --> 03:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
dementia and paranoia um they cannot be
 
03:47:55.429 --> 03:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
transferred to Specialty Care to a
 
03:47:57.910 --> 03:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
psychogeriatric unit if they have not
 
03:48:00.590 --> 03:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
signed that so that's over 50% and
 
03:48:02.630 --> 03:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
actually most of these folks who suffer
 
03:48:03.990 --> 03:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
from these conditions don't fill out
 
03:48:06.349 --> 03:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
Advanced directus for what should be
 
03:48:08.070 --> 03:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
obvious reasons they don't have the
 
03:48:11.070 --> 03:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
support they're generally Indigent they
 
03:48:13.870 --> 03:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
are suspicious to begin with and they
 
03:48:15.870 --> 03:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
cannot be treated in a psychogeriatric
 
03:48:19.510 --> 03:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
unit they end up sitting in a regular
 
03:48:22.030 --> 03:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
like our critical access Hospital often
 
03:48:23.710 --> 03:48:23.720 align:start position:0%
for months at a
 
03:48:25.990 --> 03:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
time because we can't transfer them
 
03:48:27.710 --> 03:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
because they they are saying no I don't
 
03:48:29.750 --> 03:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
want to be transferred despite the fact
 
03:48:31.070 --> 03:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
they're suffering from an advanced
 
03:48:33.110 --> 03:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
psychiatric condition that's profoundly
 
03:48:34.910 --> 03:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
impairing their
 
03:48:38.670 --> 03:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
capacity um so these are hopefully that
 
03:48:38.680 --> 03:48:39.910 align:start position:0%
capacity um so these are hopefully that
explains

03:48:39.910 --> 03:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
explains
 
03:48:42.910 --> 03:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
sort sort of the the reason for
 
03:48:44.630 --> 03:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
adjusting that treatment against
 
03:48:47.550 --> 03:48:47.560 align:start position:0%
capacity uh default that is not I've
 
03:48:50.269 --> 03:48:50.279 align:start position:0%
read at least 50 different Advanced
 
03:48:52.349 --> 03:48:52.359 align:start position:0%
directives from jurisdictions throughout
 
03:48:54.389 --> 03:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
the world and most of the US states and
 
03:48:57.790 --> 03:48:57.800 align:start position:0%
this is very specific and only in New
 
03:49:00.429 --> 03:49:00.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I understand Live Free or Die
 
03:49:00.439 --> 03:49:01.309 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I understand Live Free or Die
but

03:49:01.309 --> 03:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:49:03.750 --> 03:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this in my opinion
 
03:49:06.229 --> 03:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
clinically pushes it to a state that
 
03:49:10.110 --> 03:49:10.120 align:start position:0%
harms far more than helps um so that's
 
03:49:12.070 --> 03:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's you know kind of my point on the
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
treatment against objection component uh
 
03:49:18.910 --> 03:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
speaking to um uh representative lot's
 
03:49:21.950 --> 03:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
concerns I uh I had trouble
 
03:49:24.229 --> 03:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
understanding them and some of them were
 
03:49:26.870 --> 03:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
misrepresentations but in existing law
 
03:49:28.990 --> 03:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
the durable power of attorney has the
 
03:49:30.870 --> 03:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
authority to override the living will
 
03:49:34.389 --> 03:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
the way it is now uh the that's very
 
03:49:38.510 --> 03:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
specific in present law and so this
 
03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
document you know does explicitly try to
 
03:49:45.070 --> 03:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
simplify the situation our goal here
 
03:49:48.269 --> 03:49:48.279 align:start position:0%
primarily is to give people the
 
03:49:50.870 --> 03:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get past the barriers to
 
03:49:52.630 --> 03:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
at least comp completing the durable
 
03:49:54.710 --> 03:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
power of attorney so they can at least
 
03:49:56.670 --> 03:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
decide and speak with who they want to
 
03:49:59.590 --> 03:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
make decisions for them and to put down
 
03:50:02.269 --> 03:50:02.279 align:start position:0%
some specific you know uh statements
 
03:50:04.550 --> 03:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
about their wishes but we expect that
 
03:50:07.830 --> 03:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
other forms as uh representative Weber
 
03:50:09.910 --> 03:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
referred to they're numerous
 
03:50:12.189 --> 03:50:12.199 align:start position:0%
available where they can be assisted to
 
03:50:14.590 --> 03:50:14.600 align:start position:0%
go into much more complexity and much
 
03:50:16.429 --> 03:50:16.439 align:start position:0%
more depth about their wishes in
 
03:50:19.469 --> 03:50:19.479 align:start position:0%
specific circumstances the moment we add
 
03:50:21.590 --> 03:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
those to the durable Power of Attorney
 
03:50:23.349 --> 03:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
form whether and I would be strongly
 
03:50:25.550 --> 03:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
against adding the experimental
 
03:50:28.990 --> 03:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
treatment options in the actual form the
 
03:50:30.750 --> 03:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
moment we do that it provides a
 
03:50:30.760 --> 03:50:32.269 align:start position:0%
moment we do that it provides a
tremendous

03:50:32.269 --> 03:50:32.279 align:start position:0%
tremendous
 
03:50:34.510 --> 03:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
barrier experimental treatment for
 
03:50:36.790 --> 03:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
people who've lost capacity outside of a
 
03:50:39.830 --> 03:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic situation is exceedingly rare
 
03:50:42.349 --> 03:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
and having to go through that discussion
 
03:50:43.750 --> 03:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
if you're filling out an advanced
 
03:50:45.910 --> 03:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
directive with a patient and the
 
03:50:49.189 --> 03:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
complicated possible options is going to
 
03:50:51.389 --> 03:50:51.399 align:start position:0%
provide a significant barrier to
 
03:50:54.229 --> 03:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
completion um when it's a something that
 
03:50:56.229 --> 03:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
we very rarely
 
03:50:58.630 --> 03:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
encounter so that that was really
 
03:51:01.389 --> 03:51:01.399 align:start position:0%
focused on the pandemic and and
 
03:51:02.910 --> 03:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
situations of that sort where
 
03:51:05.510 --> 03:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
experimental treatment or un you know
 
03:51:08.590 --> 03:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
yet to be unproven treatment maybe maybe
 
03:51:12.670 --> 03:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
um appropriate and meet the standard of
 
03:51:15.469 --> 03:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
care so that that kind of covers the
 
03:51:17.189 --> 03:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
stuff that hasn't already be covered I
 
03:51:19.269 --> 03:51:19.279 align:start position:0%
wanted I wanted just to refocus on the
 
03:51:21.870 --> 03:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
the relevance and the importance of j6
 
03:51:25.149 --> 03:51:25.159 align:start position:0%
and the strong belief of the committee
 
03:51:27.910 --> 03:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh that we have to do everything
 
03:51:31.030 --> 03:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
possible to respect and to honor a
 
03:51:33.189 --> 03:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
patient's values and wishes that's the
 
03:51:35.910 --> 03:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
goal here and this
 
03:51:38.469 --> 03:51:38.479 align:start position:0%
adjustment uh and Improvement
 
03:51:39.750 --> 03:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
significant impr Improvement in my
 
03:51:41.670 --> 03:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
opinion the in the law does that it's
 
03:51:44.030 --> 03:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
been a you know a process of tremendous
 
03:51:46.269 --> 03:51:46.279 align:start position:0%
compromise of tremendous work on the
 
03:51:48.750 --> 03:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
part of a huge number of people for
 
03:51:51.189 --> 03:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
really the better part of the last year
 
03:51:52.790 --> 03:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
and and I really appreciate your time
 
03:51:55.349 --> 03:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
and the ability to speak and and would
 
03:51:57.550 --> 03:51:57.560 align:start position:0%
like to answer any questions or uh or
 
03:51:59.590 --> 03:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
certainly be available offline by email
 
03:52:02.189 --> 03:52:02.199 align:start position:0%
or otherwise to discuss you know the the
 
03:52:04.550 --> 03:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
clinical or medical aspects of it so so
 
03:52:05.830 --> 03:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the
 
03:52:09.189 --> 03:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
time thank you Dr lson uh represent
 
03:52:10.710 --> 03:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
Weber did you still have a question or
 
03:52:16.070 --> 03:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:19.309 --> 03:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
hand I guess I'll go back to it it's it
 
03:52:22.070 --> 03:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
again it was the treatment against um
 
03:52:24.110 --> 03:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
what the patient is declaring when the
 
03:52:27.030 --> 03:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
patient may not have capacity to make
 
03:52:31.510 --> 03:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
for decision making and
 
03:52:35.790 --> 03:52:35.800 align:start position:0%
um would this address am I correct in
 
03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
thinking that this would address the
 
03:52:38.040 --> 03:52:39.750 align:start position:0%
thinking that this would address the
situation

03:52:39.750 --> 03:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
situation
 
03:52:42.550 --> 03:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
that I encountered when I served as
 
03:52:45.229 --> 03:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
guardian for elders that I had not known
 
03:52:47.349 --> 03:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
previously but who needed a courta
 
03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
appointed decision maker and if I spoke
 
03:52:54.229 --> 03:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
to one of those people and asked her do
 
03:52:57.910 --> 03:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
you want an operation she would say
 
03:53:00.550 --> 03:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
no so that's declaring that she doesn't
 
03:53:03.590 --> 03:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
want it if I asked the
 
03:53:06.670 --> 03:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
question Dr Smith says you need an
 
03:53:10.630 --> 03:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
operation is that okay she would say
 
03:53:14.149 --> 03:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
yes and then if I asked so you do want
 
03:53:17.750 --> 03:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
an operation she would say
 
03:53:22.670 --> 03:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
no so that gets us into a terrible bind
 
03:53:24.670 --> 03:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
I mean in that situation I simply had
 
03:53:26.990 --> 03:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
the decision-making Authority but I was
 
03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
bound even then to follow her wishes as
 
03:53:32.670 --> 03:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
best I could follow them so does this
 
03:53:37.349 --> 03:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
not resolve the problem of um the answer
 
03:53:39.469 --> 03:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
you get depends sometimes times in the
 
03:53:44.229 --> 03:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:46.389 --> 03:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
question yes I think that's correct
 
03:53:49.990 --> 03:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I um and it just to
 
03:53:52.309 --> 03:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
clarify it's not may have lost capacity
 
03:53:54.349 --> 03:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
it legally H the patient has lost
 
03:53:56.550 --> 03:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
capacity um they have to have been
 
03:53:58.309 --> 03:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
formally assessed and that has to be a
 
03:54:00.590 --> 03:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
formal process by which they've been
 
03:54:03.790 --> 03:54:03.800 align:start position:0%
deemed to have lost capacity so this i i
 
03:54:06.950 --> 03:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
people this is an tremendously confusing
 
03:54:09.070 --> 03:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
you know part this this is to to go
 
03:54:10.630 --> 03:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
through this with patients every time
 
03:54:12.590 --> 03:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
you fill out an advanced directive is
 
03:54:16.189 --> 03:54:16.199 align:start position:0%
incredibly confusing and people get
 
03:54:18.790 --> 03:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
caught up in this this only refers to
 
03:54:21.870 --> 03:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
people who have been deemed to have lost
 
03:54:24.469 --> 03:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
capacity so you're out of it you don't
 
03:54:26.389 --> 03:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
you cannot understand your medical
 
03:54:28.670 --> 03:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
condition you cannot understand the
 
03:54:31.550 --> 03:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
options for treatment or the potential
 
03:54:34.110 --> 03:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
consequences of choosing those options
 
03:54:35.950 --> 03:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
that has been formally assessed you've
 
03:54:38.550 --> 03:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
lost it you don't have that ability
 
03:54:40.590 --> 03:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
right that that's the preset situation
 
03:54:42.229 --> 03:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
this doesn't apply except in that
 
03:54:44.630 --> 03:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
situation it is in the moment it doesn't
 
03:54:48.070 --> 03:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
refer as As I understood represent leot
 
03:54:50.189 --> 03:54:50.199 align:start position:0%
to suggest to statements made in the
 
03:54:52.670 --> 03:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
past when you did have capacity it only
 
03:54:56.189 --> 03:54:56.199 align:start position:0%
refers in the moment to the
 
03:55:00.030 --> 03:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
specific actions verbal physical
 
03:55:02.269 --> 03:55:02.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise that the patient may be
 
03:55:06.389 --> 03:55:06.399 align:start position:0%
showing um in their state of loss of
 
03:55:09.309 --> 03:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
capacity and those statements are often
 
03:55:11.630 --> 03:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
confused they're often contradictory
 
03:55:13.950 --> 03:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
they often change minute by minute hour
 
03:55:17.870 --> 03:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
by hour day by day and uh so it's it's
 
03:55:20.910 --> 03:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
very very difficult um to interpret and
 
03:55:24.630 --> 03:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely we all know that that um
 
03:55:27.070 --> 03:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
individuals particularly loved ones can
 
03:55:30.429 --> 03:55:30.439 align:start position:0%
significantly change what people who are
 
03:55:34.429 --> 03:55:34.439 align:start position:0%
confused say um by the way they ask the
 
03:55:38.870 --> 03:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
question and that that can happen and um
 
03:55:40.790 --> 03:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
I believe that the present setup of the
 
03:55:43.750 --> 03:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
default being to allow treatment over
 
03:55:46.070 --> 03:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
objection after loss of
 
03:55:48.670 --> 03:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
capacity with the option to say
 
03:55:50.710 --> 03:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise with a limit on the durable
 
03:55:54.590 --> 03:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
power I believe that that puts us firmly
 
03:55:58.429 --> 03:55:58.439 align:start position:0%
in the best position to honor wishes I
 
03:56:01.309 --> 03:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
encounter frequently situations where
 
03:56:03.189 --> 03:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
that has not been completed by those who
 
03:56:04.950 --> 03:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
either haven't completed an advanced
 
03:56:08.389 --> 03:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
directive or didn't sign that component
 
03:56:10.750 --> 03:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
of section B of the present Advanced
 
03:56:10.760 --> 03:56:12.510 align:start position:0%
of section B of the present Advanced
Direction

03:56:12.510 --> 03:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
Direction
 
03:56:15.590 --> 03:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
Where patients are suffering where
 
03:56:17.990 --> 03:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
either practitioners are forced to do an
 
03:56:24.030 --> 03:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
illegal act or they follow the law and
 
03:56:26.510 --> 03:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
the patient suffers tremendously to the
 
03:56:30.550 --> 03:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
shock of the family members of why the
 
03:56:33.149 --> 03:56:33.159 align:start position:0%
clinical team is not intervening I
 
03:56:35.590 --> 03:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
encounter that you know that comes up
 
03:56:38.790 --> 03:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
frequently the alternative case where
 
03:56:42.510 --> 03:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
there is you you know a a situation of
 
03:56:44.870 --> 03:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
someone who has purposefully not signed
 
03:56:47.710 --> 03:56:47.720 align:start position:0%
it or or and and we don't act you know
 
03:56:49.670 --> 03:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
according that is definitely a concern
 
03:56:51.630 --> 03:56:51.640 align:start position:0%
it's definitely a risk but again go back
 
03:56:54.870 --> 03:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
to j6 and focus on j6 that's the core we
 
03:56:57.070 --> 03:56:57.080 align:start position:0%
keep referencing back to it because of
 
03:57:00.110 --> 03:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
how important it is that we do our best
 
03:57:02.189 --> 03:57:02.199 align:start position:0%
as a team of people caring for someone
 
03:57:04.389 --> 03:57:04.399 align:start position:0%
to honor their wishes as best we could
 
03:57:06.630 --> 03:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
and if we believe that not responding to
 
03:57:08.389 --> 03:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
their objection after loss of capacity
 
03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
is the best that's how we would proceed
 
03:57:12.830 --> 03:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
the present law allows that no matter
 
03:57:17.189 --> 03:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:19.990 --> 03:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
signed sorry the present
 
03:57:22.469 --> 03:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
s74 you know allows that whereas the
 
03:57:24.269 --> 03:57:24.279 align:start position:0%
previous law does not that we're
 
03:57:24.279 --> 03:57:26.510 align:start position:0%
previous law does not that we're
presently

03:57:26.510 --> 03:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
presently
 
03:57:28.510 --> 03:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
under thank you for that are there any
 
03:57:32.590 --> 03:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:36.429 --> 03:57:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:38.790 --> 03:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
mer thank you Mr chairman and I'll so
 
03:57:41.349 --> 03:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Dr Lawson um it sounds like
 
03:57:43.070 --> 03:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
the critical piece here is having the
 
03:57:44.990 --> 03:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
conversation with the patient while
 
03:57:46.830 --> 03:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
they're still able to comprehend it
 
03:57:46.840 --> 03:57:47.630 align:start position:0%
they're still able to comprehend it
their

03:57:47.630 --> 03:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:57:49.830 --> 03:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
decisions um as I listen to
 
03:57:52.149 --> 03:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
representative Weber being appointed by
 
03:57:54.110 --> 03:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
a court the
 
03:57:54.120 --> 03:57:55.710 align:start position:0%
a court the
more

03:57:55.710 --> 03:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:57:59.349 --> 03:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
documentation some way along the way
 
03:58:01.149 --> 03:58:01.159 align:start position:0%
that the patient has consented whatever
 
03:58:02.990 --> 03:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about it sounds like it's
 
03:58:04.910 --> 03:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
easier on the legal system it's also
 
03:58:07.389 --> 03:58:07.399 align:start position:0%
easier on the medical system so is that
 
03:58:09.269 --> 03:58:09.279 align:start position:0%
a fair statement of trying to ascertain
 
03:58:12.030 --> 03:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
from the patient as much as possible
 
03:58:13.349 --> 03:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
what their options are and what they
 
03:58:18.189 --> 03:58:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:20.910 --> 03:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
options yeah sorry representative
 
03:58:22.790 --> 03:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
Merchant um you're breaking up a little
 
03:58:25.309 --> 03:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
bit there on my line the but I
 
03:58:28.110 --> 03:58:28.120 align:start position:0%
understand your question to be is is um
 
03:58:30.990 --> 03:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
is it not easier on the uh the court and
 
03:58:33.149 --> 03:58:33.159 align:start position:0%
the clinical team if the patient has had
 
03:58:34.990 --> 03:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
conversations beforehand that have
 
03:58:37.990 --> 03:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
stipulated their wishes that's correct
 
03:58:39.790 --> 03:58:39.800 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely absolutely and this
 
03:58:42.830 --> 03:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
balance of for sure um and the balance
 
03:58:45.870 --> 03:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
of how much to emphasize those
 
03:58:49.750 --> 03:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
conversations in the dpoa form right
 
03:58:52.110 --> 03:58:52.120 align:start position:0%
versus to to look at other more
 
03:58:54.469 --> 03:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
effective venues and
 
03:58:58.670 --> 03:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
strategies is a a somewhat challenging
 
03:59:01.550 --> 03:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
you know discussion and that's that we
 
03:59:03.469 --> 03:59:03.479 align:start position:0%
certainly came down on the side of
 
03:59:05.790 --> 03:59:05.800 align:start position:0%
making the dpoa form as simple and
 
03:59:07.750 --> 03:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
straightforward and easy to complete as
 
03:59:10.149 --> 03:59:10.159 align:start position:0%
possible with the best possible defaults
 
03:59:12.950 --> 03:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
and options for the form to be a venue
 
03:59:17.110 --> 03:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
for that extensive discussion but not
 
03:59:20.389 --> 03:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
force that form to be the venue for
 
03:59:22.349 --> 03:59:22.359 align:start position:0%
extensive discussions does that make
 
03:59:25.790 --> 03:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
sense so you know our goal is to be able
 
03:59:29.870 --> 03:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
to get more like you know 75 80% of more
 
03:59:33.030 --> 03:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
people completing at least the dpoa form
 
03:59:35.189 --> 03:59:35.199 align:start position:0%
and giving an opportunity for them to
 
03:59:38.149 --> 03:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
stipulate at least basic wishes at least
 
03:59:40.830 --> 03:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
who they want to make decisions for them
 
03:59:43.510 --> 03:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
um and uh and an opportunity at that
 
03:59:46.389 --> 03:59:46.399 align:start position:0%
time to to stipulate much more but not
 
03:59:48.910 --> 03:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
Place barriers that would significantly
 
03:59:50.790 --> 03:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
limit the chance that they're going to
 
03:59:53.830 --> 03:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
fill out this form um and then the other
 
03:59:56.229 --> 03:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
avenues whether it be three wishes the
 
03:59:58.870 --> 03:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
Catholic um document which is an
 
04:00:01.229 --> 04:00:01.239 align:start position:0%
excellent document in my opinion and
 
04:00:03.070 --> 04:00:03.080 align:start position:0%
conversation project Five Wishes there
 
04:00:07.149 --> 04:00:07.159 align:start position:0%
numerous different online free you know
 
04:00:09.269 --> 04:00:09.279 align:start position:0%
strategies to stipulate wishes that
 
04:00:11.070 --> 04:00:11.080 align:start position:0%
would be adhered to and and can do a
 
04:00:13.070 --> 04:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
much much better job than trying to
 
04:00:18.710 --> 04:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:22.229 --> 04:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
dpoa thank you are there any further
 
04:00:24.070 --> 04:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
questions for Dr LW representative
 
04:00:29.229 --> 04:00:29.239 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you Mr chair uh I am Dr
 
04:00:31.110 --> 04:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
Lawson thank you for taking my question
 
04:00:34.309 --> 04:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
I just I understand that getting um you
 
04:00:38.950 --> 04:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
know getting a guardianship in place um
 
04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
um is important for these Advanced
 
04:00:44.309 --> 04:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
dementia patients and you know it's
 
04:00:46.349 --> 04:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
better to have everything in place
 
04:00:48.469 --> 04:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
beforehand and it can be challenging to
 
04:00:50.710 --> 04:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
do it after the fact that someone is in
 
04:00:53.590 --> 04:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
an advanced stage of dementia however
 
04:00:55.710 --> 04:00:55.720 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't if this is the heart
 
04:00:57.630 --> 04:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
of the bill and it's the core of the
 
04:01:00.269 --> 04:01:00.279 align:start position:0%
bill it it's not really explicitly
 
04:01:02.469 --> 04:01:02.479 align:start position:0%
stated that way and it it leaves it open
 
04:01:05.309 --> 04:01:05.319 align:start position:0%
to apply to others besides those who
 
04:01:08.870 --> 04:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
have advanced dementia so I'm
 
04:01:12.110 --> 04:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
wondering is there um was there any
 
04:01:14.389 --> 04:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
discussion about making it specific to
 
04:01:17.030 --> 04:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
Advanced dementia because another
 
04:01:21.550 --> 04:01:21.560 align:start position:0%
concern is if a person has say
 
04:01:25.950 --> 04:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
delirium um from an acute infection and
 
04:01:29.630 --> 04:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
it's misdiagnosed as Advan as dementia
 
04:01:31.950 --> 04:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
and then the physician and their
 
04:01:34.590 --> 04:01:34.600 align:start position:0%
physician's assistant who's pretty
 
04:01:36.429 --> 04:01:36.439 align:start position:0%
influenced by The Physician and now
 
04:01:37.790 --> 04:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
they're given Authority Under this to be
 
04:01:39.189 --> 04:01:39.199 align:start position:0%
one of the designers to say that
 
04:01:41.870 --> 04:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
someone's without capacity to make
 
04:01:45.590 --> 04:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
decisions then you know and that person
 
04:01:47.590 --> 04:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
objects to something I just see a
 
04:01:49.510 --> 04:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
problem here and I wonder if that was
 
04:01:51.990 --> 04:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
addressed and the specific language to
 
04:01:55.990 --> 04:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:58.469 --> 04:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
considered yes thank you um
 
04:02:01.229 --> 04:02:01.239 align:start position:0%
representative kushman it was and in
 
04:02:03.110 --> 04:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
fact in the living will section we had
 
04:02:06.229 --> 04:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
specific language around dementia but in
 
04:02:08.870 --> 04:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
compromise with certain
 
04:02:12.229 --> 04:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
um subgroups uh that language was
 
04:02:15.910 --> 04:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
specifically removed um the as an option
 
04:02:17.510 --> 04:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know about when you would would or
 
04:02:19.750 --> 04:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want um life sustaining
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
treatment as an option the uh your point
 
04:02:24.710 --> 04:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
is well taken I do believe the the law
 
04:02:27.149 --> 04:02:27.159 align:start position:0%
would not allow a PA under the authority
 
04:02:30.309 --> 04:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
of a physician to be um one of the
 
04:02:32.469 --> 04:02:32.479 align:start position:0%
stipulating I believe it's specifically
 
04:02:34.189 --> 04:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
suggests that the physician assistant
 
04:02:35.950 --> 04:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
isn't under the authority of the
 
04:02:38.229 --> 04:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
physician just to be clear on that or or
 
04:02:40.389 --> 04:02:40.399 align:start position:0%
at least it did um in the last draft I
 
04:02:42.110 --> 04:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
had so I I don't think that situation
 
04:02:44.149 --> 04:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
could occur but I would have to be a
 
04:02:45.910 --> 04:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
physician assistant who's not under the
 
04:02:47.630 --> 04:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
authority so we we specifically
 
04:02:50.309 --> 04:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
discussed that at some length too um
 
04:02:52.309 --> 04:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
yeah and there are situations absolutely
 
04:02:54.630 --> 04:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
where where there could be misdiagnosis
 
04:03:01.030 --> 04:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
um where uh a um a group of clinicians
 
04:03:05.070 --> 04:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
as well as an including um family
 
04:03:08.149 --> 04:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
members you know may make a mistake it
 
04:03:12.870 --> 04:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely happens um but the and again
 
04:03:14.750 --> 04:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a balance of benefit and
 
04:03:16.469 --> 04:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
risk so we did look at this in regards
 
04:03:18.670 --> 04:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
to specifically dementia We There was
 
04:03:20.670 --> 04:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
talk even about a separate dementia
 
04:03:23.630 --> 04:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
directive um again I would suggest in
 
04:03:26.870 --> 04:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
our our plan was really to
 
04:03:30.149 --> 04:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
allow all those to come under j6 so that
 
04:03:32.510 --> 04:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
you know there are there is the dementia
 
04:03:34.670 --> 04:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
directive you know it's you can pull up
 
04:03:36.229 --> 04:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
online I think that's exactly what it's
 
04:03:38.670 --> 04:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
called the dementia directive um that
 
04:03:41.469 --> 04:03:41.479 align:start position:0%
allows for this kind of decision making
 
04:03:43.229 --> 04:03:43.239 align:start position:0%
along with the other tools it's one of
 
04:03:46.349 --> 04:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
the the the good tools but not to embed
 
04:03:49.229 --> 04:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
that specifically in the law and that it
 
04:03:52.269 --> 04:03:52.279 align:start position:0%
it was challenging because uh as Bob
 
04:03:53.349 --> 04:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
Dunn has
 
04:03:57.149 --> 04:03:57.159 align:start position:0%
testified um people there there are
 
04:03:59.110 --> 04:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
significant stakeholders who strongly
 
04:04:01.830 --> 04:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
believe that we should not be separating
 
04:04:05.149 --> 04:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
uh Dementia in any way uh in regards to
 
04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
how we um address you know
 
04:04:11.149 --> 04:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
decisions around these issues that a
 
04:04:12.750 --> 04:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
dementia patient should be treated
 
04:04:14.670 --> 04:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
exactly the same no matter how advanced
 
04:04:17.229 --> 04:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
their dementia may be so that was a
 
04:04:17.239 --> 04:04:21.229 align:start position:0%
their dementia may be so that was a
specific

04:04:21.229 --> 04:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:24.550 --> 04:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
compromise trust me that like
 
04:04:26.830 --> 04:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
every we we've been through and I don't
 
04:04:29.269 --> 04:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
mean that I very much respect all the
 
04:04:31.990 --> 04:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
representatives and you know input on
 
04:04:34.590 --> 04:04:34.600 align:start position:0%
this in statements but all these things
 
04:04:38.429 --> 04:04:38.439 align:start position:0%
in in excruciating detail have have been
 
04:04:40.910 --> 04:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
um discussed at
 
04:04:44.510 --> 04:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
length thank you Dr lson we appreciate
 
04:04:46.950 --> 04:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
that are there any further questions for
 
04:04:46.960 --> 04:04:48.710 align:start position:0%
that are there any further questions for
Dr

04:04:48.710 --> 04:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
Dr
 
04:04:51.510 --> 04:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
Les seeing none I said earlier that I
 
04:04:53.630 --> 04:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
recognize Mr Wells if he has something
 
04:05:02.149 --> 04:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:05.189 --> 04:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
so he's muted he's muted and if he
 
04:05:06.469 --> 04:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't wish to say anything he's
 
04:05:08.590 --> 04:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
certainly free to not say anything no
 
04:05:11.309 --> 04:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
excuse me sorry um again my name is
 
04:05:13.110 --> 04:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
Robert Wells I'm a senior director in
 
04:05:14.389 --> 04:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
the trust and the state department at
 
04:05:16.110 --> 04:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
mlan Middleton I've been practicing in
 
04:05:18.990 --> 04:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
this area for 50 years I'm also the past
 
04:05:20.710 --> 04:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
president I'm member of the board of
 
04:05:22.510 --> 04:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
directors of the Office of Public
 
04:05:25.550 --> 04:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
Guardian which office handles the great
 
04:05:27.349 --> 04:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
majority of appointments by the probate
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
court to deal with individuals with
 
04:05:32.830 --> 04:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
disabilities um historically speaking I
 
04:05:35.429 --> 04:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
think it's extremely important for this
 
04:05:38.429 --> 04:05:38.439 align:start position:0%
group to know that before we had that
 
04:05:40.429 --> 04:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
provision that Ben so carefully
 
04:05:42.070 --> 04:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
explained about the treatment against
 
04:05:45.309 --> 04:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
objection we didn't have it at that
 
04:05:47.630 --> 04:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
point I worked with then judge Maher who
 
04:05:50.990 --> 04:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
was the chief judge of the then called
 
04:05:53.910 --> 04:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
probate court to add this provision and
 
04:05:55.950 --> 04:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
the reason it was added is that the
 
04:05:58.630 --> 04:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
court was being absolutely overwhelmed
 
04:06:02.030 --> 04:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
with emergency guardianship Provisions
 
04:06:04.269 --> 04:06:04.279 align:start position:0%
proceedings uh because there was no
 
04:06:08.510 --> 04:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
provision for acting against someone's
 
04:06:11.950 --> 04:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh objection uh so what this bill
 
04:06:16.030 --> 04:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
does is expands that to make sense out
 
04:06:18.710 --> 04:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
of avoiding having to go to a court for
 
04:06:21.269 --> 04:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
an emergency Guardianship and a person
 
04:06:23.590 --> 04:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
has named someone that they trust to
 
04:06:26.189 --> 04:06:26.199 align:start position:0%
make those statements again against
 
04:06:27.630 --> 04:06:27.640 align:start position:0%
objection and what are we generally
 
04:06:29.110 --> 04:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
talking about we're generally talking
 
04:06:31.590 --> 04:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
about people in a nursing home who
 
04:06:34.229 --> 04:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
refuse to have a flu shot refuse to have
 
04:06:37.790 --> 04:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
a CO shot who don't want to have uh some
 
04:06:39.269 --> 04:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
some type of treatment if they don't
 
04:06:41.630 --> 04:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
have it they would be required to remove
 
04:06:44.950 --> 04:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
to move away from the home so what we
 
04:06:47.790 --> 04:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
have here is a very practical uh
 
04:06:50.469 --> 04:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
adjustment to our statute to allow
 
04:06:53.510 --> 04:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
greater Authority for an agent to act to
 
04:06:56.550 --> 04:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
avoid proceedings in the court what is
 
04:06:58.110 --> 04:06:58.120 align:start position:0%
also important to know is for those of
 
04:06:59.510 --> 04:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
you who deal with the Probate Court the
 
04:07:02.070 --> 04:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
probate court is absolutely overwhelmed
 
04:07:05.429 --> 04:07:05.439 align:start position:0%
with work and lack of staff and you
 
04:07:08.309 --> 04:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
impose additional object uh oblig on
 
04:07:11.309 --> 04:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
them they are not able to perform as we
 
04:07:13.630 --> 04:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
would hope they could perform that's not
 
04:07:17.070 --> 04:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
your fault that's a failure of proper uh
 
04:07:19.149 --> 04:07:19.159 align:start position:0%
investment in our court system which
 
04:07:21.790 --> 04:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
from which we all now suffer uh so I
 
04:07:24.750 --> 04:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
think it is extremely important to pass
 
04:07:26.389 --> 04:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
this bill with this provision about
 
04:07:28.149 --> 04:07:28.159 align:start position:0%
treatment against objection I do not
 
04:07:31.189 --> 04:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
believe it will in any way impact a
 
04:07:35.630 --> 04:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
negative uh group of people uh in any
 
04:07:37.550 --> 04:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
way shape or form but historically we
 
04:07:39.149 --> 04:07:39.159 align:start position:0%
need need to understand why we have what
 
04:07:40.710 --> 04:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
we have and why we need to have this
 
04:07:40.720 --> 04:07:43.349 align:start position:0%
we have and why we need to have this
additional

04:07:43.349 --> 04:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:46.189 --> 04:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
provision thank you Mr well questions
 
04:07:50.070 --> 04:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:52.349 --> 04:07:52.359 align:start position:0%
Wells seeing none is there any other
 
04:07:54.590 --> 04:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
members of the public who wish to speak
 
04:07:57.030 --> 04:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
the only hand I see up is Dr lon's and
 
04:07:58.990 --> 04:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
he just spoke I think he forgot to lower
 
04:07:59.000 --> 04:08:00.830 align:start position:0%
he just spoke I think he forgot to lower
his

04:08:00.830 --> 04:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
his
 
04:08:03.750 --> 04:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
hand and he just
 
04:08:06.910 --> 04:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
did if there are no other hands raised I
 
04:08:08.910 --> 04:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
will now close the public hearing on
 
04:08:11.469 --> 04:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 74 and the committee will be

04:32:42.910 --> 04:32:42.920 align:start position:0%

04:32:49.149 --> 04:32:49.159 align:start position:0%

and please to be here and sponsor Senate
 
04:33:03.349 --> 04:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
Bill 162 I was asked by the Department
 
04:33:06.070 --> 04:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services to
 
04:33:08.789 --> 04:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
sponsor this legislation which makes a
 
04:33:13.070 --> 04:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
number of technical changes to various
 
04:33:16.590 --> 04:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
uh laws some are broader than others um
 
04:33:20.269 --> 04:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
John Williams and his team uh will go
 
04:33:23.230 --> 04:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
through the bill section by section and
 
04:33:25.750 --> 04:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
give a delineation for you let me just
 
04:33:29.269 --> 04:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
hit a couple of the highlights that uh
 
04:33:32.269 --> 04:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
the Senate uh made changes to and by the
 
04:33:35.629 --> 04:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
way the Senate uh went through my
 
04:33:38.510 --> 04:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
committee Health and Human Services then
 
04:33:40.109 --> 04:33:40.119 align:start position:0%
it went through the finance committee
 
04:33:42.629 --> 04:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
and the final vote of the Senate um on
 
04:33:45.189 --> 04:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
the bill was 24
 
04:33:51.109 --> 04:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
to0 so the first um issue that the
 
04:33:53.670 --> 04:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
Senate looked at was section five which
 
04:33:56.910 --> 04:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
is on the first page of the bill um near
 
04:33:59.869 --> 04:33:59.879 align:start position:0%
the bottom of that page the emergency
 
04:34:04.629 --> 04:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
service plan um this is a requirement or
 
04:34:07.349 --> 04:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
in the original bill of lure for both
 
04:34:09.789 --> 04:34:09.799 align:start position:0%
physical and behavioral health by
 
04:34:13.070 --> 04:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals there was a lot of um
 
04:34:15.830 --> 04:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
discussion in the senate about how to do
 
04:34:18.109 --> 04:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
this and make sure that there was
 
04:34:21.189 --> 04:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
collaboration between hospitals and the
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:34:26.029 --> 04:34:26.039 align:start position:0%
and so as you can see on line
 
04:34:30.949 --> 04:34:30.959 align:start position:0%
28 um we called for a plan to be drafted
 
04:34:34.349 --> 04:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
that um made sure that there was
 
04:34:36.990 --> 04:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
collaboration between the parties the
 
04:34:41.390 --> 04:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals and um the
 
04:34:45.070 --> 04:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
department so just there are a number of
 
04:34:47.869 --> 04:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
sections dealing with therapeutic
 
04:34:50.869 --> 04:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
cannabis I think Mike Hol will um
 
04:34:54.629 --> 04:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
outline those these were a request of
 
04:34:56.949 --> 04:34:56.959 align:start position:0%
the department um dealing with
 
04:34:56.959 --> 04:34:58.590 align:start position:0%
the department um dealing with
therapeutic

04:34:58.590 --> 04:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
therapeutic
 
04:35:02.189 --> 04:35:02.199 align:start position:0%
cannabis skipping ahead uh there was
 
04:35:04.869 --> 04:35:04.879 align:start position:0%
some question raised in the Senate on
 
04:35:08.910 --> 04:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
page 10 section 48 about the interstate
 
04:35:11.670 --> 04:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
compact for placement of children I just
 
04:35:15.029 --> 04:35:15.039 align:start position:0%
want to stress this is not a new law
 
04:35:17.029 --> 04:35:17.039 align:start position:0%
this is existing
 
04:35:19.990 --> 04:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
legislation uh that has been repealed
 
04:35:22.869 --> 04:35:22.879 align:start position:0%
and reenacted and I think when folks
 
04:35:26.789 --> 04:35:26.799 align:start position:0%
understood that any questions um
 
04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:34.199 --> 04:35:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
score

04:35:35.750 --> 04:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
score
 
04:35:37.869 --> 04:35:37.879 align:start position:0%
there was some
 
04:35:41.510 --> 04:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
discussion jumping ahead to page 28
 
04:35:43.470 --> 04:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
section 53 and
 
04:35:45.990 --> 04:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
54 about the auto
 
04:35:50.429 --> 04:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
injectors um the camps came to us and we
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
added the language that you see at the
 
04:35:55.390 --> 04:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
bottom of page 28 which shall be
 
04:35:58.551 --> 04:35:58.561 align:start position:0%
reasonably accessible and that's
 
04:36:00.629 --> 04:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
replicated um
 
04:36:05.949 --> 04:36:05.959 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the bill um Section 5
 
04:36:11.510 --> 04:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
5 uh and 56 these are important um
 
04:36:14.109 --> 04:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
issues for the division children youth
 
04:36:16.910 --> 04:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
and family um and I'll I'll just leave
 
04:36:19.029 --> 04:36:19.039 align:start position:0%
it at that and let Mr Williams and
 
04:36:20.551 --> 04:36:20.561 align:start position:0%
others talk about
 
04:36:25.150 --> 04:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:27.869 --> 04:36:27.879 align:start position:0%
32 starting in line
 
04:36:31.269 --> 04:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
14 the Medicaid work requirement there's
 
04:36:33.670 --> 04:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
been a lot of discussion about that
 
04:36:36.629 --> 04:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
right now it's under suspension due to
 
04:36:39.789 --> 04:36:39.799 align:start position:0%
an injunction in federal court so this
 
04:36:43.470 --> 04:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
language just clarifies that if a court
 
04:36:47.470 --> 04:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
holds it's invalid if the center for
 
04:36:50.629 --> 04:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid services withdraws
 
04:36:53.349 --> 04:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
approval um then the program will be
 
04:36:56.830 --> 04:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
suspended and that just clarifies what
 
04:37:00.590 --> 04:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
could in fact be the case if it gets
 
04:37:02.590 --> 04:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
changed in
 
04:37:05.830 --> 04:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
Washington uh two other things
 
04:37:07.990 --> 04:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
um section
 
04:37:10.910 --> 04:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
71 which is the next to last section on
 
04:37:16.150 --> 04:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
page 75 uh page 35 excuse me was added
 
04:37:18.551 --> 04:37:18.561 align:start position:0%
as a result of a discussion that
 
04:37:21.269 --> 04:37:21.279 align:start position:0%
occurred in Senate Bill 140 which was
 
04:37:23.910 --> 04:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosen wald's Bill about the
 
04:37:26.070 --> 04:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
possibility of
 
04:37:29.949 --> 04:37:29.959 align:start position:0%
lure uh for case management and again
 
04:37:32.310 --> 04:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
like with the hospitals if there is
 
04:37:35.109 --> 04:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
going to be a discussion about license
 
04:37:38.349 --> 04:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
ing um case managers we wanted to make
 
04:37:40.709 --> 04:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody had a seat at the
 
04:37:45.310 --> 04:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
table um and that's what section 71 does
 
04:37:47.349 --> 04:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh one other thing that I would add that
 
04:37:51.709 --> 04:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
did get dropped from the bill um was a
 
04:37:54.390 --> 04:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
section that would have required um
 
04:37:57.230 --> 04:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Providers to provide
 
04:37:59.830 --> 04:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
transitional housing there was a lot of
 
04:38:04.269 --> 04:38:04.279 align:start position:0%
controversy about that um we dropped it
 
04:38:07.029 --> 04:38:07.039 align:start position:0%
because of commitment that uh the
 
04:38:09.349 --> 04:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
department and commissioner shanet have
 
04:38:12.390 --> 04:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
made to deal with that in terms of
 
04:38:15.949 --> 04:38:15.959 align:start position:0%
Contracting and I believe that um there
 
04:38:18.990 --> 04:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
will be more information coming out
 
04:38:20.949 --> 04:38:20.959 align:start position:0%
about that shortly from the
 
04:38:23.670 --> 04:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office so um thank you
 
04:38:27.109 --> 04:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair and happy to answer
 
04:38:27.119 --> 04:38:28.150 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair and happy to answer
your

04:38:28.150 --> 04:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:38:33.189 --> 04:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:36.269 --> 04:38:36.279 align:start position:0%
senator representative Marsh yes thank
 
04:38:38.269 --> 04:38:38.279 align:start position:0%
you senator for appearing before our
 
04:38:40.189 --> 04:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
committee and and bringing this bill to
 
04:38:42.029 --> 04:38:42.039 align:start position:0%
our attention my question refers to
 
04:38:44.429 --> 04:38:44.439 align:start position:0%
sections 12 and 13 which you just
 
04:38:49.709 --> 04:38:49.719 align:start position:0%
referred to uh page that's on page three
 
04:38:52.551 --> 04:38:52.561 align:start position:0%
and what this does is it strikes out
 
04:38:54.189 --> 04:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
language from one of my bills a few
 
04:38:56.429 --> 04:38:56.439 align:start position:0%
years ago and replaces it with the
 
04:38:58.310 --> 04:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
language that this chapter shall not
 
04:39:00.029 --> 04:39:00.039 align:start position:0%
apply to individuals who have been
 
04:39:02.029 --> 04:39:02.039 align:start position:0%
issued a registry identification card
 
04:39:05.310 --> 04:39:05.320 align:start position:0%
and so forth uh my read of the new
 
04:39:07.590 --> 04:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
language is that this means that youth
 
04:39:09.590 --> 04:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
who've been issued a registry
 
04:39:12.070 --> 04:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
identification card will now legally be
 
04:39:14.390 --> 04:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to go and buy cigarettes at the
 
04:39:17.269 --> 04:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
corner store and is that your intention
 
04:39:18.990 --> 04:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
I rather doubt that that's actually your
 
04:39:22.269 --> 04:39:22.279 align:start position:0%
intention here not my intention and
 
04:39:25.109 --> 04:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
obviously um that's a question for Mr
 
04:39:28.869 --> 04:39:28.879 align:start position:0%
Williams and um others when they
 
04:39:31.750 --> 04:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
testify and as a followup Mr chairman
 
04:39:34.029 --> 04:39:34.039 align:start position:0%
follow up would would you be dreadfully
 
04:39:35.750 --> 04:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
upset if I putting an amendment to
 
04:39:39.190 --> 04:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
remove sections 12 and 13 from this vill
 
04:39:41.510 --> 04:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh probably better to try to rewrite it
 
04:39:43.670 --> 04:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the Department's
 
04:39:47.030 --> 04:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
intent is captured but if that if
 
04:39:48.708 --> 04:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
there's no other way to do it then I
 
04:39:52.030 --> 04:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
would agree with you thank you very
 
04:39:55.070 --> 04:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
much any other questions uh
 
04:39:55.080 --> 04:40:00.030 align:start position:0%
much any other questions uh
representative

04:40:00.030 --> 04:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:02.590 --> 04:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:40:04.830 --> 04:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking my question just
 
04:40:09.310 --> 04:40:09.320 align:start position:0%
to be completely sure that I understand
 
04:40:15.708 --> 04:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
uh on page 32 lines 14 to 17 if we pass
 
04:40:21.070 --> 04:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
those as they stand then even if it is
 
04:40:24.190 --> 04:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
Court action or some other action that
 
04:40:27.628 --> 04:40:27.638 align:start position:0%
we here in New Hampshire cannot
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
control if any entity invalidates the
 
04:40:36.350 --> 04:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
work in community
 
04:40:36.360 --> 04:40:38.070 align:start position:0%
work in community
engagement

04:40:38.070 --> 04:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
engagement
 
04:40:40.990 --> 04:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
waiver then the whole program is
 
04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
suspended is that
 
04:40:46.350 --> 04:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
correct the work program not Medicaid
 
04:40:50.190 --> 04:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
expansion the work program okay the
 
04:40:52.150 --> 04:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
Workforce program thank you for
 
04:40:54.910 --> 04:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
clarifying that that relieves my mind
 
04:40:56.948 --> 04:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
considerably well I would hope so yeah
 
04:40:58.948 --> 04:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
you had me there for a minute I was
 
04:41:00.750 --> 04:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
really worried that the whole thing was
 
04:41:02.708 --> 04:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
going straight away and I did not read
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
it quite carefully enough thank you
 
04:41:10.628 --> 04:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:13.830 --> 04:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Senator okay thank
 
04:41:18.070 --> 04:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:21.390 --> 04:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
much I had a nice conversation with Mr
 
04:41:25.030 --> 04:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
John Williams recently and he told me
 
04:41:28.708 --> 04:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
that he has F tested a walkth through
 
04:41:31.868 --> 04:41:31.878 align:start position:0%
the bill in the Senate and it made
 
04:41:34.868 --> 04:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
things go very quickly and very smooth
 
04:41:38.788 --> 04:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
Wiley so having tried it Off Broadway
 
04:41:40.270 --> 04:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
the chair now
 
04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
recognizes John Williams to walk us
 
04:41:45.150 --> 04:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
through the
 
04:41:48.948 --> 04:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
bill Mr chair and members of the Health

04:41:59.390 --> 04:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
today in support of the department
 
04:42:03.110 --> 04:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
requested Omnibus Bill and it is a a
 
04:42:06.230 --> 04:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
thoughtful approach to to bring together
 
04:42:08.230 --> 04:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
the Department's entirety of its policy
 
04:42:11.910 --> 04:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
legislation in one bill uh for those of
 
04:42:14.948 --> 04:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
you who are uh in the session or part of
 
04:42:16.788 --> 04:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
the membership of the legislature back
 
04:42:19.830 --> 04:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
in 2019 you may recall pre-pandemic
 
04:42:23.708 --> 04:42:23.718 align:start position:0%
times that we brought forward SB 289
 
04:42:25.830 --> 04:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
which was the Department's Omnibus Bill
 
04:42:27.670 --> 04:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
at that time and it worked exceedingly
 
04:42:29.868 --> 04:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
well in terms of the use of your time in
 
04:42:32.430 --> 04:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
energy so uh Mr chair with your
 
04:42:33.990 --> 04:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
permission if we could have uh
 
04:42:36.510 --> 04:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
researcher Dyer Miss Dyer uh bring up
 
04:42:39.470 --> 04:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
the text legislation uh what we will do
 
04:42:42.910 --> 04:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
is give a high level walkr of the uh
 
04:42:46.270 --> 04:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
pieces of Senate Bill 162 give some
 
04:42:48.910 --> 04:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
context and also I have with me uh
 
04:42:50.590 --> 04:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
several other members of the department
 
04:42:53.510 --> 04:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
that I will call on uh to uh provide you
 
04:42:54.788 --> 04:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
with background information on the
 
04:42:56.708 --> 04:42:56.718 align:start position:0%
various sections of the bill I also
 
04:42:58.948 --> 04:42:58.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to thank uh Senator Bradley for
 
04:43:00.470 --> 04:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
his graciousness and bringing forth
 
04:43:03.030 --> 04:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
legislation and also for the the work
 
04:43:05.030 --> 04:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
they had done in the Senate to actually
 
04:43:07.788 --> 04:43:07.798 align:start position:0%
get a very good bill uh in front of you
 
04:43:10.150 --> 04:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
here today so if we can enlarge the
 
04:43:12.628 --> 04:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
screen just a little bit Miss dyer for
 
04:43:13.670 --> 04:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
those of us
 
04:43:16.430 --> 04:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
who are a little bit challenged with
 
04:43:20.510 --> 04:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
reading glasses fantastic thank you so
 
04:43:23.230 --> 04:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
section one of the bill uh is a series
 
04:43:25.270 --> 04:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
of uh nine different sections throughout
 
04:43:28.708 --> 04:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
the legislation and they are a cleanup
 
04:43:30.910 --> 04:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
of dedicated funds that are administered
 
04:43:32.310 --> 04:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Health and Human
 
04:43:34.550 --> 04:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
Services there is a joint legislative
 
04:43:36.350 --> 04:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
committee on dedicated funds they've
 
04:43:39.270 --> 04:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
been in existence since around 2014
 
04:43:42.430 --> 04:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
2015 and on a fiveyear basis every
 
04:43:44.910 --> 04:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
agency has to go through a rotation to
 
04:43:49.110 --> 04:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
justify their various um dedicated funds
 
04:43:50.430 --> 04:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things that will be important
 
04:43:52.430 --> 04:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
to understanding all these nine sections
 
04:43:54.470 --> 04:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
is that there are two parts that are
 
04:43:57.910 --> 04:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
essential for a dedicated fund one is
 
04:44:00.150 --> 04:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
you have to have a fund in the enabling
 
04:44:03.390 --> 04:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
legislation with the uh with the agency
 
04:44:05.868 --> 04:44:05.878 align:start position:0%
so and in addition to that you have to
 
04:44:08.590 --> 04:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
have a corresponding fund with the
 
04:44:10.628 --> 04:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
Department of Treasury so I'm just going
 
04:44:13.150 --> 04:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
to repeat that again for clarity that
 
04:44:14.868 --> 04:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
you have to have two pieces of
 
04:44:17.788 --> 04:44:17.798 align:start position:0%
legislation for every fund one within
 
04:44:20.430 --> 04:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
the enabling legislation for uh the
 
04:44:22.350 --> 04:44:22.360 align:start position:0%
agency and program area and then a
 
04:44:24.550 --> 04:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
corresponding fund within the treasury
 
04:44:26.590 --> 04:44:26.600 align:start position:0%
account and those funds in the treasury
 
04:44:30.708 --> 04:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
account are found under RSA 6 col 12 so
 
04:44:32.708 --> 04:44:32.718 align:start position:0%
in section one of the bill where you see
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
application for receipts this is
 
04:44:37.190 --> 04:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
essentially creating the treasury
 
04:44:40.750 --> 04:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
account necessary for the um for the uh
 
04:44:43.310 --> 04:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
funds that are identified uh on line
 
04:44:46.030 --> 04:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
three and as you see in the lines the
 
04:44:48.788 --> 04:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
bolditalic is the new sections uh that
 
04:44:51.708 --> 04:44:51.718 align:start position:0%
are requiring this the first one under
 
04:44:51.718 --> 04:44:53.590 align:start position:0%
are requiring this the first one under
457

04:44:53.590 --> 04:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
457
 
04:44:56.910 --> 04:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
32b that involved a recently passed uh
 
04:44:58.868 --> 04:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
legislation that was not requested by
 
04:45:00.470 --> 04:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
the department but certainly one that
 
04:45:02.390 --> 04:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature passed and that was
 
04:45:04.430 --> 04:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
involving the special marriage efficient
 
04:45:06.230 --> 04:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
license so again that's a special
 
04:45:08.310 --> 04:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
marriage efficient license and
 
04:45:11.310 --> 04:45:11.320 align:start position:0%
respectively the underlying Bill uh
 
04:45:13.310 --> 04:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
failed to have the linkage with the
 
04:45:14.910 --> 04:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
second required account within the
 
04:45:16.510 --> 04:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
treasury Department and therefore we're
 
04:45:19.070 --> 04:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
bringing a technical cleanup uh so that
 
04:45:21.070 --> 04:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
it actually has a place for the treasury
 
04:45:23.948 --> 04:45:23.958 align:start position:0%
to receive that those funds the next one
 
04:45:25.910 --> 04:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
is from legislation from
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
2015 uh that involved what they call the
 
04:45:30.628 --> 04:45:30.638 align:start position:0%
Joshua law it's embedded in the uh
 
04:45:33.070 --> 04:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
criminal code of New Hampshire and it
 
04:45:34.550 --> 04:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
involves violation prote protective
 
04:45:36.990 --> 04:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
orders and that a portion of those fees
 
04:45:39.470 --> 04:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
collected as a result of that uh have a
 
04:45:41.070 --> 04:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
place to be deposited again we're not
 
04:45:42.868 --> 04:45:42.878 align:start position:0%
creating the fund but we're just trying
 
04:45:46.948 --> 04:45:46.958 align:start position:0%
to find a a home for it within the um
 
04:45:49.430 --> 04:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
within the uh treasury statutes and so
 
04:45:51.390 --> 04:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
you'll see uh eventually at the very end
 
04:45:53.990 --> 04:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
on line four it makes reference to the
 
04:45:56.190 --> 04:45:56.200 align:start position:0%
existing fund that is actually when we
 
04:45:58.670 --> 04:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
get to I believe a later well it will be
 
04:46:00.510 --> 04:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
in a later section of this bill you'll
 
04:46:02.310 --> 04:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
see that we made a corresponding change
 
04:46:05.110 --> 04:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
to link up those funds uh that you find
 
04:46:08.270 --> 04:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
within the 173b which are the domestic
 
04:46:10.350 --> 04:46:10.360 align:start position:0%
violence Coalition funds that are
 
04:46:12.670 --> 04:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
administered by our agency and provided
 
04:46:13.550 --> 04:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:46:16.910 --> 04:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
Coalition so in in in section two of the
 
04:46:19.430 --> 04:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
bill uh you'll see also the exact same
 
04:46:21.070 --> 04:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
thing happening except for this these
 
04:46:23.430 --> 04:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
are funds that are housed within our
 
04:46:25.708 --> 04:46:25.718 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health Services we
 
04:46:27.350 --> 04:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
have our radiological Health that are
 
04:46:29.590 --> 04:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
identified in RSA
 
04:46:33.070 --> 04:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
125f and then we have our shellfish uh
 
04:46:36.030 --> 04:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
such things as glams and other shellfish
 
04:46:40.110 --> 04:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
uh that are identified in 143 22A and
 
04:46:41.868 --> 04:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
then we have a corresponding piece that
 
04:46:43.390 --> 04:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
comes back to our food Protection
 
04:46:45.590 --> 04:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
Services licensure so again they're just
 
04:46:48.390 --> 04:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
linking up all these funds and fees that
 
04:46:50.230 --> 04:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
are being collected into a specific
 
04:46:52.310 --> 04:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
dedicated account those funds exist this
 
04:46:53.910 --> 04:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
is just creating the treasury account to
 
04:46:57.030 --> 04:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
go along with it so moving along to
 
04:46:59.708 --> 04:46:59.718 align:start position:0%
section three of the bill uh and section
 
04:47:02.708 --> 04:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
four these relate to um human resource
 
04:47:04.750 --> 04:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
items within the department section
 
04:47:06.628 --> 04:47:06.638 align:start position:0%
three is building on the progress that
 
04:47:08.390 --> 04:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
our agency has made over the last four
 
04:47:10.750 --> 04:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
years to identify uh unclassified
 
04:47:12.510 --> 04:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
positions within the department to make
 
04:47:14.670 --> 04:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
sure that our working in legal titles
 
04:47:17.350 --> 04:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
align believe it or not at one time we
 
04:47:21.310 --> 04:47:21.320 align:start position:0%
had a uh a Information Systems director
 
04:47:23.230 --> 04:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
who was identified in statute as as a
 
04:47:25.628 --> 04:47:25.638 align:start position:0%
dentist and so we needed to clean up so
 
04:47:27.788 --> 04:47:27.798 align:start position:0%
that the titles within our agencies
 
04:47:29.670 --> 04:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
align with the actual people and the
 
04:47:32.350 --> 04:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
work that they do so in this occasion uh
 
04:47:35.590 --> 04:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
we're seeking an amendment uh to the
 
04:47:38.190 --> 04:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
specific uh uh unclassified position in
 
04:47:40.948 --> 04:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
the GD grade uh for a Medicaid uh
 
04:47:43.390 --> 04:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
Enterprise development uh uh and that
 
04:47:44.750 --> 04:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
staff would work directly with Henry
 
04:47:46.190 --> 04:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
Litman within his
 
04:47:49.310 --> 04:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
agency section four of the bill uh deals
 
04:47:51.708 --> 04:47:51.718 align:start position:0%
with compensation of certain officers
 
04:47:54.070 --> 04:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
also under uh the same statute that
 
04:47:56.548 --> 04:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
deals with unclassified positions and it
 
04:47:59.510 --> 04:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
is the vision of uh commissioner shanet
 
04:48:02.990 --> 04:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
to take away the specific uh qualifiers
 
04:48:05.628 --> 04:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
for the existing Commissioners uh so
 
04:48:07.430 --> 04:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
that you'll see that we would be moving
 
04:48:09.150 --> 04:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
from uh the three associate
 
04:48:10.430 --> 04:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that we have within the
 
04:48:12.628 --> 04:48:12.638 align:start position:0%
department we would take away the
 
04:48:15.030 --> 04:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
qualifiers at the end because uh the
 
04:48:17.150 --> 04:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
goals here are for greater efficiency in
 
04:48:19.150 --> 04:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
government to allow uh the commissioner
 
04:48:21.310 --> 04:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
or any commissioner to be able to align
 
04:48:23.708 --> 04:48:23.718 align:start position:0%
nimbly uh those particular associate
 
04:48:25.390 --> 04:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners were were needed and to
 
04:48:27.670 --> 04:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
make those adjustments very clearly and
 
04:48:30.030 --> 04:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
so the descriptors that were added
 
04:48:31.868 --> 04:48:31.878 align:start position:0%
within the last five years somewhat
 
04:48:33.350 --> 04:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
limit and hamper the Department's
 
04:48:35.788 --> 04:48:35.798 align:start position:0%
efforts to have flexibility to address
 
04:48:38.030 --> 04:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
those needed resources as directed by
 
04:48:40.670 --> 04:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
the commissioner so on line 15 you'll
 
04:48:42.708 --> 04:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
see that we strike the extender and it
 
04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
carries on to line 16 of Human Services
 
04:48:47.510 --> 04:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
and variable Health that leaves us with
 
04:48:49.750 --> 04:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
the uh associate commissioner position
 
04:48:51.350 --> 04:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
the second of three associate
 
04:48:53.390 --> 04:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner positions was of operations
 
04:48:55.548 --> 04:48:55.558 align:start position:0%
we're striking that and then you'll see
 
04:48:57.788 --> 04:48:57.798 align:start position:0%
on lines 19 the Department of Health and
 
04:48:59.390 --> 04:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
services commissioner for population
 
04:49:01.310 --> 04:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
Health striking that now there was
 
04:49:03.470 --> 04:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
scribers error already in existing law
 
04:49:05.270 --> 04:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
that they had provided for an additional
 
04:49:07.270 --> 04:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
two Commissioners uh positions within
 
04:49:09.390 --> 04:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
our agency so we need to clean up and
 
04:49:11.390 --> 04:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that it it reflects accurately
 
04:49:12.628 --> 04:49:12.638 align:start position:0%
the three associate commissioner
 
04:49:14.470 --> 04:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
positions within our agency and
 
04:49:17.350 --> 04:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
therefore striking um the uh scrier
 
04:49:19.708 --> 04:49:19.718 align:start position:0%
errors for a fourth and a fifth
 
04:49:21.110 --> 04:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner position within
 
04:49:24.230 --> 04:49:24.240 align:start position:0%

as for section five uh the department
 
04:49:54.070 --> 04:49:54.080 align:start position:0%

04:49:56.590 --> 04:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
or obtain parody for mental health and
 
04:49:58.628 --> 04:49:58.638 align:start position:0%

04:50:14.628 --> 04:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley and working with other
 
04:50:17.150 --> 04:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um changed the we we
 
04:50:20.628 --> 04:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
changed the language to allow for the
 
04:50:22.150 --> 04:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
parties to get together the hospitals
 
04:50:24.670 --> 04:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
the department to get together and uh
 
04:50:26.430 --> 04:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
make recommendations for future
 
04:50:30.030 --> 04:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
legislation to help help obtain that
 
04:50:31.590 --> 04:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
parity that mental health
 
04:50:36.190 --> 04:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:38.310 --> 04:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
and Miss Dyer advancing to section six
 
04:50:41.230 --> 04:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
of the bill this these this section and
 
04:50:44.430 --> 04:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
two other related sections uh identify a
 
04:50:47.030 --> 04:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
needed a much needed position within the
 
04:50:48.868 --> 04:50:48.878 align:start position:0%
the agency that's already in in
 
04:50:51.948 --> 04:50:51.958 align:start position:0%
existence which is a bureau chief um uh
 
04:50:53.788 --> 04:50:53.798 align:start position:0%
that would be um with emergency
 
04:50:55.270 --> 04:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
preparedness and response within the
 
04:50:58.150 --> 04:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
department and and so what this section
 
04:51:00.230 --> 04:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
six does and then two other related
 
04:51:03.190 --> 04:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
sections to the bill is to allow the
 
04:51:05.548 --> 04:51:05.558 align:start position:0%
department to get the best qualified
 
04:51:07.948 --> 04:51:07.958 align:start position:0%
candidate and when I say that uh in
 
04:51:09.590 --> 04:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
terms of the recruitment process we may
 
04:51:12.030 --> 04:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
be looking for individuals who are
 
04:51:14.270 --> 04:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
either in emergency services under the
 
04:51:16.830 --> 04:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
department of safety or law enforcement
 
04:51:18.910 --> 04:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
and currently they're under the group
 
04:51:21.948 --> 04:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
two State retirement so this would allow
 
04:51:23.948 --> 04:51:23.958 align:start position:0%
the department to hire an individual
 
04:51:26.708 --> 04:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
who's currently in group two and to
 
04:51:28.788 --> 04:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
bring them in and for them for that
 
04:51:30.510 --> 04:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
particular candidate if they were to be
 
04:51:32.830 --> 04:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
successful and employed to maintain
 
04:51:34.350 --> 04:51:34.360 align:start position:0%
their group to employment which is
 
04:51:36.350 --> 04:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
really critical because there would be a
 
04:51:38.070 --> 04:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
disincentive if they were to come into
 
04:51:40.670 --> 04:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
our agency and lose their group two only
 
04:51:43.788 --> 04:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
to have to go for uh with the group one
 
04:51:46.590 --> 04:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
um um uh retirement system it also
 
04:51:50.110 --> 04:51:50.120 align:start position:0%
allows also and not to the exclusion of
 
04:51:51.948 --> 04:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
uh other candidates but it allows the
 
04:51:54.708 --> 04:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
department to look very uh clearly at
 
04:51:56.270 --> 04:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
who's most qualified to fill that
 
04:51:59.230 --> 04:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
position and whether they come in uh new
 
04:52:01.430 --> 04:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
to the department and come in as a group
 
04:52:03.708 --> 04:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
one or we find somebody who has EXP
 
04:52:05.350 --> 04:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
experience uh under the department of
 
04:52:07.788 --> 04:52:07.798 align:start position:0%
safety under group two this allows the
 
04:52:10.948 --> 04:52:10.958 align:start position:0%
department to hire that person who has
 
04:52:12.788 --> 04:52:12.798 align:start position:0%
the best qualifications to fill that
 
04:52:15.230 --> 04:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
position without any inherent uh
 
04:52:17.110 --> 04:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
disincentives for applicants or
 
04:52:18.670 --> 04:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
candidates to seek those positions
 
04:52:19.628 --> 04:52:19.638 align:start position:0%
within the
 
04:52:21.990 --> 04:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
department moving to section seven of
 
04:52:24.590 --> 04:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
the bill uh we have radiological health
 
04:52:27.708 --> 04:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
programs we saw earlier in section one
 
04:52:30.548 --> 04:52:30.558 align:start position:0%
of the bill that um this is the the
 
04:52:32.190 --> 04:52:32.200 align:start position:0%
corresponding section that deals with
 
04:52:34.230 --> 04:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
the dedicated non-aps accounts as it
 
04:52:36.990 --> 04:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
relates to rad radiological help uh
 
04:52:39.470 --> 04:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
section eight of the bill involves the
 
04:52:42.548 --> 04:52:42.558 align:start position:0%
offices of Ombudsman and many of you are
 
04:52:44.708 --> 04:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
aware that within our agency we actually
 
04:52:46.670 --> 04:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
have two different udsm we have a
 
04:52:49.430 --> 04:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
general Ombudsman who represents the
 
04:52:51.910 --> 04:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
public clients and and works on their
 
04:52:54.230 --> 04:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
behalf to resolve specific issues that
 
04:52:56.670 --> 04:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
they may be having with the department
 
04:52:58.788 --> 04:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
and in addition to that we also have
 
04:53:00.948 --> 04:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
which is not affected by this section
 
04:53:04.110 --> 04:53:04.120 align:start position:0%
our um budsman for long-term uh uh care
 
04:53:06.270 --> 04:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
services and they're called Alito the
 
04:53:08.470 --> 04:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
office of long-term care um budsman and
 
04:53:10.230 --> 04:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
they look at issues as it relates to
 
04:53:12.590 --> 04:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
complaints uh that may be received
 
04:53:14.390 --> 04:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
regarding the treatment of loved ones
 
04:53:17.150 --> 04:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
and Care in the nursing facility setting
 
04:53:19.030 --> 04:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
but again this one deals with
 
04:53:21.830 --> 04:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
specifically those uh involving uh
 
04:53:24.470 --> 04:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
customers clients of the department and
 
04:53:26.830 --> 04:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make sure that the statute
 
04:53:29.628 --> 04:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
uh clearly identified that the primary
 
04:53:32.830 --> 04:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
and singular goal of the Ombudsman is to
 
04:53:34.948 --> 04:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
uh represent those interest uh under
 
04:53:38.590 --> 04:53:38.600 align:start position:0%
under current law however it also uh
 
04:53:41.110 --> 04:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
includes the uh word employees which
 
04:53:42.628 --> 04:53:42.638 align:start position:0%
causes some confusion because there's
 
04:53:44.590 --> 04:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
already existing process either through
 
04:53:47.110 --> 04:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
the uh Human Resources through the
 
04:53:49.628 --> 04:53:49.638 align:start position:0%
division of personnel through um uh
 
04:53:51.708 --> 04:53:51.718 align:start position:0%
admin services for a process for the
 
04:53:53.910 --> 04:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
fair treatment and and and regular help
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
of and support for our employees
 
04:53:58.830 --> 04:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
including also our employee assistance
 
04:54:01.470 --> 04:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
program otherwise known as EAP uh for
 
04:54:03.788 --> 04:54:03.798 align:start position:0%
the support so this is a cleanup to
 
04:54:06.070 --> 04:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
clarify the role of the Ombudsman to
 
04:54:08.830 --> 04:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
representing clients within our agencies
 
04:54:11.590 --> 04:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
the next section section nine is a
 
04:54:13.350 --> 04:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
grouping of another project we had
 
04:54:14.990 --> 04:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier a project within our
 
04:54:18.070 --> 04:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
agency to uh clean up our dedicated
 
04:54:20.190 --> 04:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
funds to align the funds with the
 
04:54:23.830 --> 04:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
treasury accounts there is also h a uh
 
04:54:26.350 --> 04:54:26.360 align:start position:0%
there is also an exercise going forward
 
04:54:29.230 --> 04:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
within the department to identify uh all
 
04:54:30.948 --> 04:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
the Department's reporting requirements
 
04:54:33.110 --> 04:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
including those reporting requirements
 
04:54:36.548 --> 04:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
that are either uh duplicative of our
 
04:54:38.830 --> 04:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
our our works they're outdated or
 
04:54:41.310 --> 04:54:41.320 align:start position:0%
they're redundant and so we had brought
 
04:54:45.230 --> 04:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
before this committee a series of U of
 
04:54:47.788 --> 04:54:47.798 align:start position:0%
uh requests for repealing some of the
 
04:54:50.070 --> 04:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
outdated um uh reporting requirements
 
04:54:52.310 --> 04:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
that are out there and this includes one
 
04:54:54.590 --> 04:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
of them in section nine of the
 
04:54:56.910 --> 04:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
bill section
 
04:55:00.670 --> 04:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
10 of the bill uh includes the status
 
04:55:02.150 --> 04:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
and the retirement account and again
 
04:55:03.590 --> 04:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
this is a corresponding piece of we
 
04:55:06.830 --> 04:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
spoke of earlier regarding the group two
 
04:55:08.270 --> 04:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the bureau chief for
 
04:55:10.990 --> 04:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
emergency preparedness uh uh within the
 
04:55:14.788 --> 04:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
department uh section 11 uh that is a
 
04:55:17.230 --> 04:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
repeal of the housing security guarantee
 
04:55:20.910 --> 04:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
program and we already in have a process
 
04:55:22.750 --> 04:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
for funding these programs in a
 
04:55:24.390 --> 04:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
completely different Source that's been
 
04:55:26.190 --> 04:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
very efficient very effective and
 
04:55:28.830 --> 04:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
therefore we're requesting uh the repeal
 
04:55:31.390 --> 04:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
of those sections that are not utilized
 
04:55:33.788 --> 04:55:33.798 align:start position:0%
by the department and included with that
 
04:55:35.590 --> 04:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
is the corresponding dedicated funds
 
04:55:38.230 --> 04:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
within the treasury statute at this time
 
04:55:41.350 --> 04:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair if I could ask that uh Mr
 
04:55:44.150 --> 04:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
Michael Holt with our division of Public
 
04:55:45.868 --> 04:55:45.878 align:start position:0%
Health Services therapeutic cannabis
 
04:55:47.990 --> 04:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
manager if he could now walk the
 
04:55:49.948 --> 04:55:49.958 align:start position:0%
committee through the sections that
 
04:55:52.190 --> 04:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
involve the therapeutic cannabis program
 
04:55:54.150 --> 04:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
and also to address the question that
 
04:55:56.628 --> 04:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
was raised by represent Marsh relative
 
04:55:59.470 --> 04:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
to sections 12 and 13 and I just would
 
04:56:00.788 --> 04:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
like to say we look forward to working
 
04:56:02.590 --> 04:56:02.600 align:start position:0%
with you represent Marsh uh and the
 
04:56:05.310 --> 04:56:05.320 align:start position:0%
committee on any amendments as they may
 
04:56:06.510 --> 04:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
be related to those sections
 
04:56:07.868 --> 04:56:07.878 align:start position:0%
particularly if you believe there's
 
04:56:10.070 --> 04:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence as currently
 
04:56:12.510 --> 04:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
written so Mr
 
04:56:18.070 --> 04:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
H Mr Holt uh yes thank you very much um
 
04:56:19.830 --> 04:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
my name is Michael Holt I'm representing
 
04:56:21.150 --> 04:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services I'm the
 
04:56:22.510 --> 04:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
administrator of the therapeutic
 
04:56:24.510 --> 04:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis program this is Department
 
04:56:26.270 --> 04:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
requested legislation so obviously the
 
04:56:29.230 --> 04:56:29.240 align:start position:0%
department supports this bill so uh as
 
04:56:30.670 --> 04:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
introductory remarks I'll keep them
 
04:56:32.230 --> 04:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
brief but this bill would make a number
 
04:56:34.150 --> 04:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
of changes to the therapeutic cannabis
 
04:56:36.390 --> 04:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
law most of these changes were proposed
 
04:56:38.590 --> 04:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
in the last legislative session and were
 
04:56:40.350 --> 04:56:40.360 align:start position:0%
passed by the full Senate both last year
 
04:56:42.708 --> 04:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
and this year these changes in large
 
04:56:45.070 --> 04:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
part are in direct response to a per
 
04:56:47.150 --> 04:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
performance audit of the therapeutic
 
04:56:50.830 --> 04:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis program conducted by the LBA in
 
04:56:53.470 --> 04:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
2019 the LBA recommended that the
 
04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
department reduce burden for patients
 
04:56:58.708 --> 04:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
and caregivers streamline and simplify
 
04:57:00.868 --> 04:57:00.878 align:start position:0%
administrative processes for applying to
 
04:57:03.548 --> 04:57:03.558 align:start position:0%
the program and seek legislation where
 
04:57:06.628 --> 04:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
necessary to achieve these goals this
 
04:57:08.750 --> 04:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
legislation is in direct response to the
 
04:57:10.350 --> 04:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
LBA audit
 
04:57:12.548 --> 04:57:12.558 align:start position:0%
recommendations to that end many of the
 
04:57:14.548 --> 04:57:14.558 align:start position:0%
changes proposed in this bill are
 
04:57:16.590 --> 04:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
technical in nature and I don't plan to
 
04:57:18.430 --> 04:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
go through each minor technical change
 
04:57:20.310 --> 04:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
unless there's a question uh but there
 
04:57:22.750 --> 04:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
are some policy proposals included which
 
04:57:25.190 --> 04:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
support the LBA audit findings and the
 
04:57:27.590 --> 04:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
Department's response to that
 
04:57:31.350 --> 04:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
audit um now if we go in order of what's
 
04:57:35.670 --> 04:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
on the screen now um we go to a non LBA
 
04:57:39.430 --> 04:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
audit related uh matter and this is uh
 
04:57:41.788 --> 04:57:41.798 align:start position:0%
sections 12 and
 
04:57:44.750 --> 04:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
13 which
 
04:57:47.590 --> 04:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
um this is a technical change to better
 
04:57:50.510 --> 04:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
align and remove conflicts between two
 
04:57:52.948 --> 04:57:52.958 align:start position:0%
chapters of state law this is a new
 
04:57:54.948 --> 04:57:54.958 align:start position:0%
proposal this year uh which Builds on
 
04:57:57.990 --> 04:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
work from previous sessions related to
 
04:58:00.310 --> 04:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
youth access to tobacco products called
 
04:58:03.830 --> 04:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
tobacco 21 so this bill would create an
 
04:58:05.948 --> 04:58:05.958 align:start position:0%
exception within RSA
 
04:58:08.830 --> 04:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
126k the youth access to and use of
 
04:58:12.230 --> 04:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
tobacco products law relative to the use
 
04:58:15.270 --> 04:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
of therapeutic cannabis it establishes
 
04:58:17.190 --> 04:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
that the youth tobacco law does not
 
04:58:18.788 --> 04:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
apply to registered patients and
 
04:58:21.150 --> 04:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
caregivers of the therapeutic cannabis
 
04:58:23.350 --> 04:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
program nor would it apply to the
 
04:58:25.270 --> 04:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
state's licensed alternative treatment
 
04:58:27.990 --> 04:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
centers and this is important with
 
04:58:30.750 --> 04:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
respect to the therapeutic use of
 
04:58:33.270 --> 04:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis this chapter wide exception is
 
04:58:34.948 --> 04:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
necessary because the therapeutic
 
04:58:37.830 --> 04:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis law allows people under 21
 
04:58:40.230 --> 04:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
years of age to be patients within the
 
04:58:43.548 --> 04:58:43.558 align:start position:0%
program and because the atc's dispense
 
04:58:45.910 --> 04:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
products and accessories that overlap
 
04:58:48.030 --> 04:58:48.040 align:start position:0%
with products that are regulated by the
 
04:58:51.310 --> 04:58:51.320 align:start position:0%
youth tobacco law so in response to
 
04:58:54.110 --> 04:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative Marsha's concern here the
 
04:58:57.350 --> 04:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
phrase onlines
 
04:59:00.070 --> 04:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
2021 with respect to the therapeutic use
 
04:59:02.750 --> 04:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
of cannabis are critical to address his
 
04:59:05.310 --> 04:59:05.320 align:start position:0%
con concerns that this language in no
 
04:59:08.830 --> 04:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
way would exempt people under
 
04:59:13.548 --> 04:59:13.558 align:start position:0%
21 uh from the balance of the tobacco
 
04:59:16.350 --> 04:59:16.360 align:start position:0%
law it would maintain the prohibition
 
04:59:20.510 --> 04:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
for this population against the purchase
 
04:59:24.788 --> 04:59:24.798 align:start position:0%
and use of tobacco products regulated by
 
04:59:28.430 --> 04:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
126x and so again that line 20 to 21
 
04:59:30.628 --> 04:59:30.638 align:start position:0%
it's an exemption with respect to the
 
04:59:32.750 --> 04:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use of cannabis the New
 
04:59:35.510 --> 04:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire atcs do not sell cigarettes
 
04:59:37.830 --> 04:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
and a person within who's under 21
 
04:59:40.510 --> 04:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
cannot show their registry ID card at a
 
04:59:42.350 --> 04:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
convenience store and buy tobacco
 
04:59:44.788 --> 04:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
products if this language is found to be
 
04:59:46.868 --> 04:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
unclear or not sufficient I'd be happy
 
04:59:48.670 --> 04:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
to work with representative Marsh on
 
04:59:51.070 --> 04:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
clear language but in no way is this
 
04:59:54.350 --> 04:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
intended to exempt the under 21
 
04:59:57.430 --> 04:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
population uh from the uh the the the
 
04:59:57.440 --> 05:00:01.230 align:start position:0%
population uh from the uh the the the
tobacco

05:00:01.230 --> 05:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:05.708 --> 05:00:05.718 align:start position:0%
law so moving on um there are a c a few
 
05:00:09.830 --> 05:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
more policy proposals here um one policy
 
05:00:12.030 --> 05:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
proposal would allow medical providers
 
05:00:13.990 --> 05:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
to certify their patients for the
 
05:00:16.390 --> 05:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program for up to
 
05:00:18.948 --> 05:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
three years at a time the current
 
05:00:20.590 --> 05:00:20.600 align:start position:0%
duration of a provider's written
 
05:00:23.470 --> 05:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
certification is one year this bill
 
05:00:25.548 --> 05:00:25.558 align:start position:0%
would not mandate a three-year
 
05:00:27.868 --> 05:00:27.878 align:start position:0%
certification rather it would allow
 
05:00:30.190 --> 05:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
providers the medical discretion
 
05:00:33.110 --> 05:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
necessary to issue longer duration
 
05:00:35.868 --> 05:00:35.878 align:start position:0%
certifications when appropriate note
 
05:00:37.628 --> 05:00:37.638 align:start position:0%
that providers already have the
 
05:00:39.948 --> 05:00:39.958 align:start position:0%
authority to issue shorter duration
 
05:00:42.670 --> 05:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
certifications of say six months and
 
05:00:44.708 --> 05:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
they have the authority to resend a
 
05:00:48.190 --> 05:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
certification at any
 
05:00:51.430 --> 05:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
time uh the next policy proposal in the
 
05:00:54.670 --> 05:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
bill would increase the patient increase
 
05:00:56.230 --> 05:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
patient access to the state's
 
05:00:58.430 --> 05:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers there are
 
05:01:00.270 --> 05:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
a number of references throughout this
 
05:01:03.628 --> 05:01:03.638 align:start position:0%
bill uh that are impacted by this policy
 
05:01:06.708 --> 05:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
change currently there are only seven
 
05:01:10.190 --> 05:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
ATC dispensary locations in the entire
 
05:01:12.628 --> 05:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
State and patients are restricted to
 
05:01:16.510 --> 05:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
accessing only one ATC at a time this
 
05:01:18.430 --> 05:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
legislation would allow New Hampshire
 
05:01:21.270 --> 05:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
patients to access all the ATC
 
05:01:25.150 --> 05:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
dispensary locations in the state at any
 
05:01:27.708 --> 05:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
time the last policy proposal I'd like
 
05:01:31.270 --> 05:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
to mention again not audit related but
 
05:01:34.110 --> 05:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
would allow authorized employees of the
 
05:01:36.628 --> 05:01:36.638 align:start position:0%
department to possess and transport
 
05:01:39.990 --> 05:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis for inspection
 
05:01:43.030 --> 05:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
investigation and Regulatory Compliance
 
05:01:45.510 --> 05:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
purposes currently Department staff are
 
05:01:47.070 --> 05:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
not permitted to conduct these
 
05:01:49.390 --> 05:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
activities on cannabis products without
 
05:01:52.270 --> 05:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
the regulated entity the atc's
 
05:01:54.510 --> 05:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
maintaining control of the products
 
05:01:57.310 --> 05:01:57.320 align:start position:0%
being inspected this bill would allow
 
05:01:59.510 --> 05:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
authorized Department staff to identify
 
05:02:01.990 --> 05:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis products at the dispensary or
 
05:02:04.110 --> 05:02:04.120 align:start position:0%
at the cultivation facility for quality
 
05:02:06.350 --> 05:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
control purposes and IL legally
 
05:02:08.590 --> 05:02:08.600 align:start position:0%
transport those products to a testing
 
05:02:12.590 --> 05:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:15.430 --> 05:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
state and that concludes my prepared
 
05:02:17.548 --> 05:02:17.558 align:start position:0%
testimony happy to answer questions
 
05:02:19.910 --> 05:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
after the full presentation is
 
05:02:23.070 --> 05:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
over and Mr chair um that brings us to
 
05:02:27.590 --> 05:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
page seven uh on line 27 to section
 
05:02:30.750 --> 05:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
33 and I just would ask Miss Dyer if if
 
05:02:32.990 --> 05:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
director Henry Lipman is with us at the
 
05:02:35.910 --> 05:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
present time he was doing a briefing
 
05:02:38.708 --> 05:02:38.718 align:start position:0%
before Senate Finance on for the
 
05:02:41.590 --> 05:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
division for Medicaid services and if he
 
05:02:43.270 --> 05:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
has concluded that he's going to jump on
 
05:02:46.030 --> 05:02:46.040 align:start position:0%
the call with us right now to discuss
 
05:02:49.670 --> 05:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:52.788 --> 05:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
bill he's with us able to
 
05:02:56.708 --> 05:02:56.718 align:start position:0%
speak um good afternoon um Henry Litman
 
05:02:58.430 --> 05:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director I'm hoping you can
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
hear me okay
 
05:03:06.750 --> 05:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
yes um the provision um in um Senate
 
05:03:09.868 --> 05:03:09.878 align:start position:0%
Bill 162 is identical to the provision
 
05:03:13.190 --> 05:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
that was passed by the house in um HB uh
 
05:03:17.390 --> 05:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
2 um the purpose of this uh provision is
 
05:03:22.110 --> 05:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
to support the compliance with RSA
 
05:03:25.548 --> 05:03:25.558 align:start position:0%
16764 which was the um agreement between
 
05:03:27.948 --> 05:03:27.958 align:start position:0%
the state and the hospitals with respect
 
05:03:31.150 --> 05:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
to um uh compensation for uncompensated
 
05:03:35.868 --> 05:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
care back in 20 2018 when this um was
 
05:03:39.310 --> 05:03:39.320 align:start position:0%
adopted it was expected that the um way
 
05:03:41.230 --> 05:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
in which the state uh would pay
 
05:03:44.470 --> 05:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals may need to evolve over time
 
05:03:48.990 --> 05:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
and what this um provision allows is for
 
05:03:51.510 --> 05:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
um Medicaid enhancement tax to the
 
05:03:54.830 --> 05:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
extent it's um already used to pay
 
05:03:57.190 --> 05:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
providers would be allowed under the
 
05:03:59.070 --> 05:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage Program for purposes
 
05:04:02.310 --> 05:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
of complying with the settlement um
 
05:04:04.750 --> 05:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
agree between the hospitals and the the
 
05:04:08.708 --> 05:04:08.718 align:start position:0%
state and um as um you know codified in
 
05:04:11.470 --> 05:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
this uh statute RSA
 
05:04:14.430 --> 05:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
16764 um again I think I just highlight
 
05:04:18.430 --> 05:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
that um it is an hb2 um identical as it
 
05:04:21.430 --> 05:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
is into Senate Bill 162 I'd be happy to
 
05:04:24.030 --> 05:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
take questions here if there are
 
05:04:24.040 --> 05:04:31.548 align:start position:0%
take questions here if there are
any

05:04:31.548 --> 05:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:31.558 --> 05:04:34.510 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:04:34.510 --> 05:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:04:38.750 --> 05:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
I don't see any hands up I appreciate uh
 
05:04:40.590 --> 05:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
you continuing to support this as it's
 
05:04:42.350 --> 05:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
very important for our our compliance
 
05:04:44.990 --> 05:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
and commitment uh with the hospitals
 
05:04:45.000 --> 05:04:46.628 align:start position:0%
and commitment uh with the hospitals
thank

05:04:46.628 --> 05:04:46.638 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:04:50.590 --> 05:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
you and Mr shair I may proceed um uh
 
05:04:53.070 --> 05:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
with Section
 
05:04:56.990 --> 05:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
34 please proceed thank you so section
 
05:05:01.230 --> 05:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
34 is is uh related to section 65 and a
 
05:05:02.788 --> 05:05:02.798 align:start position:0%
couple of other sections so when we get
 
05:05:04.390 --> 05:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
to that uh regarding the administration
 
05:05:05.868 --> 05:05:05.878 align:start position:0%
of epinephrine we will cover this in
 
05:05:07.948 --> 05:05:07.958 align:start position:0%
more detail but essentially this is
 
05:05:10.150 --> 05:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
repealing within the Department of
 
05:05:11.628 --> 05:05:11.638 align:start position:0%
Health and services this particular
 
05:05:14.030 --> 05:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
Authority that's being transferred uh
 
05:05:15.750 --> 05:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
proposed to be transferred to the office
 
05:05:16.948 --> 05:05:16.958 align:start position:0%
of professional licensure and
 
05:05:18.510 --> 05:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
certification and we'll get into more
 
05:05:21.310 --> 05:05:21.320 align:start position:0%
detail when we get to section 65 uh the
 
05:05:22.270 --> 05:05:22.280 align:start position:0%
next section dealing with the
 
05:05:24.470 --> 05:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
communicable uh disease mosquito control
 
05:05:27.470 --> 05:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
fund if uh Miss D if we can go to lines
 
05:05:29.390 --> 05:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
five and six you'll see that it relates
 
05:05:31.830 --> 05:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
to certain funds uh that were to be
 
05:05:34.150 --> 05:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
deposited not lapsed uh back on June
 
05:05:36.788 --> 05:05:36.798 align:start position:0%
30th of 2009 since we're doing a
 
05:05:38.470 --> 05:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
thoughtful cleanup of all the other
 
05:05:40.110 --> 05:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
funds we just figured this would be a
 
05:05:42.470 --> 05:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
good thing to add to the list as well uh
 
05:05:44.030 --> 05:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
where it's outdated and it's already
 
05:05:46.470 --> 05:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
passed uh the next section deals with
 
05:05:49.030 --> 05:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
the uh shellfish uh we had already
 
05:05:52.110 --> 05:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
discussed in section two of the bill uh
 
05:05:53.788 --> 05:05:53.798 align:start position:0%
the um funds and this is the
 
05:05:57.070 --> 05:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
corresponding fund uh within the um
 
05:05:59.548 --> 05:05:59.558 align:start position:0%
actual enabling legislation under uh
 
05:06:01.910 --> 05:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
under the food protection uh Services uh
 
05:06:03.670 --> 05:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
we do have members from our food
 
05:06:05.150 --> 05:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
Protection Services with us in case
 
05:06:06.868 --> 05:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
there's questions around any of these
 
05:06:09.590 --> 05:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
items uh but you'll see also section 37
 
05:06:12.190 --> 05:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
also relates to the same uh dedicated
 
05:06:15.150 --> 05:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
fund as well as sections
 
05:06:19.868 --> 05:06:19.878 align:start position:0%
38 so miss Dyer if we can scroll up
 
05:06:22.708 --> 05:06:22.718 align:start position:0%
please uh section 39 uh nursing home
 
05:06:25.350 --> 05:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
administrator uh patient account this
 
05:06:27.070 --> 05:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
starts approximately three or four
 
05:06:30.390 --> 05:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
sections of the bill that deal with our
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh legal and Regulatory Services Under
 
05:06:34.548 --> 05:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
under our estate Recovery Unit the
 
05:06:37.270 --> 05:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
estate recovery Union unit is um
 
05:06:39.750 --> 05:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
supervised by an attorney and
 
05:06:42.470 --> 05:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
essentially what their job is is to to
 
05:06:44.590 --> 05:06:44.600 align:start position:0%
make sure to ensure that taxpayer
 
05:06:47.350 --> 05:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
dollars are are recovered appropriately
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
and what I'm referring to is where in
 
05:06:52.070 --> 05:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
cases where individuals uh receive
 
05:06:54.750 --> 05:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
medical assistance um including
 
05:06:57.670 --> 05:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
Long-Term Care nursing facilities that
 
05:07:00.310 --> 05:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
um there is a an obligation obviously if
 
05:07:02.990 --> 05:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
there are assets out there uh for the
 
05:07:05.150 --> 05:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
Department to recover including placing
 
05:07:08.350 --> 05:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
leans on properties to collect for those
 
05:07:11.110 --> 05:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh expenditures and so all this does is
 
05:07:12.948 --> 05:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
it changes the jurisdictional
 
05:07:15.628 --> 05:07:15.638 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional amount from $5,000 to
 
05:07:20.150 --> 05:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
$10,000 on those um Estates that are are
 
05:07:22.310 --> 05:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh have a very little amount with within
 
05:07:24.708 --> 05:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
the estate so you'll see that change
 
05:07:27.070 --> 05:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
throughout uh and when we come to them
 
05:07:29.350 --> 05:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
we'll stop pause but we have them as it
 
05:07:31.070 --> 05:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
relates to the nurse and home
 
05:07:32.270 --> 05:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
administrators the guardian staff
 
05:07:34.868 --> 05:07:34.878 align:start position:0%
statutes and and another statute uh that
 
05:07:37.150 --> 05:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
we'll get to uh we did um have a
 
05:07:39.230 --> 05:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
conversation you know with with the with
 
05:07:42.910 --> 05:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
the uh bar community and certainly uh
 
05:07:45.628 --> 05:07:45.638 align:start position:0%
the um working with them they are uh
 
05:07:47.190 --> 05:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
appreciative and understanding of the
 
05:07:49.310 --> 05:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
goals that we're trying to reach and um
 
05:07:51.628 --> 05:07:51.638 align:start position:0%
and uh and so thank you so moving along
 
05:07:54.510 --> 05:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
to section 40 of the bill that just
 
05:07:57.190 --> 05:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
deals with the effective date so that
 
05:07:58.628 --> 05:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
when the courts are making orders that
 
05:08:00.670 --> 05:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
it's very clear as to when that
 
05:08:03.030 --> 05:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
particular moment takes place that the
 
05:08:05.868 --> 05:08:05.878 align:start position:0%
new provision of the $5,000 to $10,000
 
05:08:07.310 --> 05:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
takes place it's a very thoughtful
 
05:08:09.708 --> 05:08:09.718 align:start position:0%
approach in terms of a very clear
 
05:08:12.190 --> 05:08:12.200 align:start position:0%
effective date uh the next one involved
 
05:08:15.868 --> 05:08:15.878 align:start position:0%
the cleanup of unnecessary reports uh as
 
05:08:19.070 --> 05:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
part of RSA 151e as it relates to
 
05:08:21.030 --> 05:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
utilization of uh non- nursing home
 
05:08:23.190 --> 05:08:23.200 align:start position:0%
services so that's addressed by other
 
05:08:25.788 --> 05:08:25.798 align:start position:0%
reports that the department already does
 
05:08:28.350 --> 05:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
the perspectives uh under section 42
 
05:08:30.670 --> 05:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
Protective Service adults and reports to
 
05:08:33.548 --> 05:08:33.558 align:start position:0%
adult uh abuse this is a bill that we
 
05:08:35.150 --> 05:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
brought last session that that was
 
05:08:37.310 --> 05:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
tabled but was in it was postured for
 
05:08:40.070 --> 05:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
passage and what it relates to is the
 
05:08:42.430 --> 05:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
department uh within our Bureau of elen
 
05:08:45.670 --> 05:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
Adult Services has a unit that protects
 
05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
um adults so it's called the adult
 
05:08:50.310 --> 05:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
protection uh Services uh function of
 
05:08:52.868 --> 05:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
our agency so if there are complaints
 
05:08:55.350 --> 05:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
about a vulnerable adult whether aged
 
05:08:59.350 --> 05:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
disabled we investigate um those upon uh
 
05:09:02.310 --> 05:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
a receipt of uh uh information that we
 
05:09:05.070 --> 05:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
need to conduct an investigation under
 
05:09:07.430 --> 05:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
current law however it's currently
 
05:09:09.350 --> 05:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
drafted that the individual who's the
 
05:09:13.708 --> 05:09:13.718 align:start position:0%
vulnerable adult has to be alive at the
 
05:09:15.990 --> 05:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
time that the report is being
 
05:09:18.510 --> 05:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
investigated and unfortunately there was
 
05:09:21.030 --> 05:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
a set of circumstances where an
 
05:09:23.708 --> 05:09:23.718 align:start position:0%
individual who is charged with an adult
 
05:09:26.590 --> 05:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
who uh had Dementia or some related
 
05:09:29.190 --> 05:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
disorder uh had a requirement to watch
 
05:09:30.670 --> 05:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
that person at their residence in
 
05:09:33.750 --> 05:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
community based care uh every 30 minutes
 
05:09:36.230 --> 05:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh um and the allegations
 
05:09:38.190 --> 05:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
are that that time period was not
 
05:09:40.470 --> 05:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
adhered to and on a hot summer day
 
05:09:43.430 --> 05:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that adult uh who
 
05:09:45.430 --> 05:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
vulnerable adult uh got into their
 
05:09:48.190 --> 05:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle and and expired due due to heat
 
05:09:49.910 --> 05:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
So based upon the fact that that
 
05:09:52.830 --> 05:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
individual died there was a barrier to
 
05:09:54.628 --> 05:09:54.638 align:start position:0%
adding that person's name upon an
 
05:09:56.510 --> 05:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
investigation and a finding of abuse of
 
05:09:58.990 --> 05:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
neglect to our registry so that that
 
05:10:01.670 --> 05:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
person could in fact seek employment in
 
05:10:03.628 --> 05:10:03.638 align:start position:0%
a longterm Care Facility or in a
 
05:10:06.670 --> 05:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
community based um um uh with without
 
05:10:09.830 --> 05:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
being caught on on the registry so this
 
05:10:12.948 --> 05:10:12.958 align:start position:0%
was an important um consideration and a
 
05:10:15.230 --> 05:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
very important piece that uh was tabled
 
05:10:16.868 --> 05:10:16.878 align:start position:0%
last session and we're happy to see it
 
05:10:20.788 --> 05:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
in this bill right here uh sections 43
 
05:10:23.430 --> 05:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
are also outdated um reporting
 
05:10:25.270 --> 05:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
requirements as you'll see uh from
 
05:10:27.910 --> 05:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
sections one through four one of those
 
05:10:29.670 --> 05:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
sections actually relates to a following
 
05:10:30.868 --> 05:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
section that we're going to discuss in
 
05:10:34.948 --> 05:10:34.958 align:start position:0%
in a moment which is RS a 165 colon 20c
 
05:10:37.070 --> 05:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
and when we uh get to that section we'll
 
05:10:39.230 --> 05:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
talk about it which is is coming up uh
 
05:10:43.670 --> 05:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
very soon um so section 44 a to assisted
 
05:10:47.910 --> 05:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
person's expenses uh to amend RSA
 
05:10:51.670 --> 05:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
1602 um a that's a cross reference to
 
05:10:56.390 --> 05:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
removing the repealed 16520 C so that's
 
05:10:59.830 --> 05:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
just a um OSS catch on where it needs to
 
05:11:02.670 --> 05:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
be caught in other statutes the public
 
05:11:04.150 --> 05:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
assistance Financial Disclosure by
 
05:11:06.868 --> 05:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
applicants re uh and recipients under
 
05:11:06.878 --> 05:11:08.990 align:start position:0%
applicants re uh and recipients under
RSA

05:11:08.990 --> 05:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
05:11:13.948 --> 05:11:13.958 align:start position:0%
167 four lowercase a Roman six uh also
 
05:11:15.910 --> 05:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh addresses that same issue as it
 
05:11:18.590 --> 05:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
relates to that um issue so if we can
 
05:11:21.510 --> 05:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
scroll down Miss Dyer so I can get to
 
05:11:23.830 --> 05:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
the appropriate section oh right so this
 
05:11:25.868 --> 05:11:25.878 align:start position:0%
this section here in the very bottom uh
 
05:11:27.868 --> 05:11:27.878 align:start position:0%
is striking out a reporting requirement
 
05:11:29.628 --> 05:11:29.638 align:start position:0%
that is since passed and no longer so
 
05:11:31.350 --> 05:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
this is part of our our cleanup on a
 
05:11:33.310 --> 05:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement departments so Mr
 
05:11:36.310 --> 05:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
chair we've now reached on page 10 line
 
05:11:39.190 --> 05:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
16 section 46 as it relates to the child
 
05:11:41.230 --> 05:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
protection act and with your with your
 
05:11:43.390 --> 05:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh we'd like I'd like you to
 
05:11:45.948 --> 05:11:45.958 align:start position:0%
recognize uh attorney Rebecca Ross who's
 
05:11:47.708 --> 05:11:47.718 align:start position:0%
our general counsel and legislative lays
 
05:11:49.830 --> 05:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
on for our agency's division for
 
05:11:51.750 --> 05:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
children youth and families and she can
 
05:11:53.830 --> 05:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
take you through this section as well as
 
05:11:55.270 --> 05:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
the following sections that actually
 
05:11:57.030 --> 05:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
make up the bulk of the bill as it
 
05:11:59.548 --> 05:11:59.558 align:start position:0%
relates to the interstate compact the
 
05:12:02.910 --> 05:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
attorney is so recognized thank you Mr
 
05:12:04.510 --> 05:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee for
 
05:12:06.750 --> 05:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Rebecca Ross I'm
 
05:12:09.030 --> 05:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
general counsel and legislative liaison
 
05:12:10.868 --> 05:12:10.878 align:start position:0%
for the division for children youth and
 
05:12:14.150 --> 05:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
families um section 46 investigative
 
05:12:17.750 --> 05:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
interviews addresses a narrow but
 
05:12:19.788 --> 05:12:19.798 align:start position:0%
critical Gap in the child protection
 
05:12:22.948 --> 05:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
system by allowing courts to expressly
 
05:12:25.030 --> 05:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
have the authority to order an
 
05:12:28.190 --> 05:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
investigative interview or examination
 
05:12:33.030 --> 05:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
of a child um in order to complete an
 
05:12:36.230 --> 05:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
investigation of abuse or neglect um it
 
05:12:39.470 --> 05:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
is always the division's position that
 
05:12:43.670 --> 05:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
we work with families um and work
 
05:12:45.990 --> 05:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
cooperatively with them even when we're
 
05:12:48.310 --> 05:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
investigating but in the rare instance
 
05:12:51.030 --> 05:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
that we are unable to get access to a
 
05:12:53.310 --> 05:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
child we need the court to have the
 
05:12:56.150 --> 05:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
ability to order an evaluation of that
 
05:12:58.830 --> 05:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
child um right now the law as written
 
05:13:01.390 --> 05:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
allows us to access the home with a
 
05:13:04.310 --> 05:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
court order but it does not actually
 
05:13:07.310 --> 05:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
allow um an order to speak with or
 
05:13:09.510 --> 05:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
examine a child and this is critically
 
05:13:12.390 --> 05:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
important for small children who may not
 
05:13:14.590 --> 05:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
be in school or daycare full-time if
 
05:13:16.590 --> 05:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
they are within a home that we are
 
05:13:18.590 --> 05:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
unable to access and unable to have them
 
05:13:20.628 --> 05:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
evaluated we cannot complete our
 
05:13:22.990 --> 05:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
investigations so we believe this would
 
05:13:27.150 --> 05:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
be used rarely but in critical cases the
 
05:13:31.470 --> 05:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
next section is um section 47 and this
 
05:13:35.270 --> 05:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
was is made at the request of another
 
05:13:37.830 --> 05:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
Bureau of the department it amends the
 
05:13:39.990 --> 05:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
dcyf central registry which is our
 
05:13:42.708 --> 05:13:42.718 align:start position:0%
registry of findings of abuse and
 
05:13:45.948 --> 05:13:45.958 align:start position:0%
neglect um this would allow employers
 
05:13:48.270 --> 05:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
who are providing services to the
 
05:13:50.910 --> 05:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled population to
 
05:13:53.628 --> 05:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
check to ensure that their employees who
 
05:13:55.788 --> 05:13:55.798 align:start position:0%
are providing services to a vulnerable
 
05:13:58.190 --> 05:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
population do not have a prior finding
 
05:14:04.070 --> 05:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:07.350 --> 05:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
the next section is section
 
05:14:11.110 --> 05:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
48 is the interstate compact for the
 
05:14:12.830 --> 05:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
placement of children and as Senator
 
05:14:15.430 --> 05:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
Bradley said this is not a new law this
 
05:14:20.190 --> 05:14:20.200 align:start position:0%
is seeking to adopt the an updated
 
05:14:22.548 --> 05:14:22.558 align:start position:0%
version of the law that will not become
 
05:14:25.750 --> 05:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
effective until 37 or 35 states have
 
05:14:28.070 --> 05:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
adopted it so far there are about a
 
05:14:29.868 --> 05:14:29.878 align:start position:0%
dozen that have adopted including the
 
05:14:32.310 --> 05:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
neighboring state of Maine um there are
 
05:14:34.110 --> 05:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
a couple key reasons why this is
 
05:14:37.470 --> 05:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
important to New Hampshire it will the
 
05:14:39.910 --> 05:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
last time this was amended was 1995 so
 
05:14:42.750 --> 05:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
it is it is definitely out of date and
 
05:14:45.470 --> 05:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
in need of updating um it will be
 
05:14:48.750 --> 05:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
particularly helpful in addressing the
 
05:14:51.030 --> 05:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
accountability between states so that
 
05:14:54.830 --> 05:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
when we have um a child who we're
 
05:14:57.350 --> 05:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
looking to place in another state
 
05:14:59.470 --> 05:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
potentially with a relative or vice
 
05:15:01.990 --> 05:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
versa someone wants to place a while
 
05:15:05.030 --> 05:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
here with a relative through our system
 
05:15:07.628 --> 05:15:07.638 align:start position:0%
it establishes better cooperation
 
05:15:09.708 --> 05:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
collaboration and communication
 
05:15:11.788 --> 05:15:11.798 align:start position:0%
including electronic communication that
 
05:15:15.670 --> 05:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
is not currently permitted um so that we
 
05:15:18.670 --> 05:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
have more timely information if we ask
 
05:15:20.310 --> 05:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
another state to provide us with that
 
05:15:21.868 --> 05:15:21.878 align:start position:0%
information and we're held accountable
 
05:15:24.190 --> 05:15:24.200 align:start position:0%
to the other states who are seeking our
 
05:15:26.948 --> 05:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
assistance so um we are looking to be
 
05:15:29.110 --> 05:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
one of the proactive states to adopt
 
05:15:31.350 --> 05:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
that but again it would not be effective
 
05:15:35.390 --> 05:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
and until 35 states have adopted it um
 
05:15:37.590 --> 05:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
and John I believe that's the end of my

as for this change in section 51
 
05:16:23.910 --> 05:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
childcare licensing currently licenses
 
05:16:26.788 --> 05:16:26.798 align:start position:0%
school age programs which are basically
 
05:16:30.110 --> 05:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
child daycare agencies that are provided
 
05:16:33.948 --> 05:16:33.958 align:start position:0%
uh for schoolage children and currently
 
05:16:37.628 --> 05:16:37.638 align:start position:0%
our statute has restrictions on um age
 
05:16:41.628 --> 05:16:41.638 align:start position:0%
and so we have asked that those um those
 
05:16:44.310 --> 05:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
restrictions be changed to four years
 
05:16:47.470 --> 05:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
and8 months of age or older so that
 
05:16:50.590 --> 05:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
those children who are entering into
 
05:16:53.750 --> 05:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
kindergarten can seek out a child or
 
05:16:55.628 --> 05:16:55.638 align:start position:0%
school age program and become become

to them entering kindergarten so that
 
05:17:02.548 --> 05:17:02.558 align:start position:0%
that is what this Chang is seeking to do
 
05:17:02.558 --> 05:17:04.350 align:start position:0%
that is what this Chang is seeking to do
thank

05:17:04.350 --> 05:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:17:07.510 --> 05:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
you and Mr chair that takes us also to
 
05:17:09.430 --> 05:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
related to our child care licensing to
 
05:17:12.390 --> 05:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
section 53 of the bill and this involves
 
05:17:15.750 --> 05:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
the um accessibility or availability of
 
05:17:19.270 --> 05:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
the um an EpiPen uh as well as an
 
05:17:20.830 --> 05:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
inhaler you'll see in the following
 
05:17:22.628 --> 05:17:22.638 align:start position:0%
section and I just wanted to to
 
05:17:25.110 --> 05:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
recognize the good works done by uh Miss
 
05:17:26.990 --> 05:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
Melissa Clement within our agency who's
 
05:17:30.070 --> 05:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
our child care uh licensing um uh person
 
05:17:32.430 --> 05:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
who oversees that unit and she along
 
05:17:34.628 --> 05:17:34.638 align:start position:0%
with her supervisor Dorene Shockley
 
05:17:37.030 --> 05:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
worked very positively with the camp
 
05:17:39.110 --> 05:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
Community along with Henry Vu who
 
05:17:41.150 --> 05:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
represented uh one of the key
 
05:17:43.070 --> 05:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to come with an
 
05:17:45.110 --> 05:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
accommodation so we appreciate that and
 
05:17:47.708 --> 05:17:47.718 align:start position:0%
so what this essentially says is that
 
05:17:49.990 --> 05:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
those items whether an epen or an
 
05:17:53.430 --> 05:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
inhaler need to be readily accessible to
 
05:17:56.150 --> 05:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
to the camp uh so that uh from a
 
05:17:57.628 --> 05:17:57.638 align:start position:0%
obviously from a public health Public
 
05:17:59.470 --> 05:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
Safety standpoint that they have their
 
05:18:02.390 --> 05:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
needed inhalers and EpiPen
 
05:18:05.150 --> 05:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
um that takes us to section 55 of the
 
05:18:08.150 --> 05:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
bill on page 29 line 10 again that is
 
05:18:11.830 --> 05:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
section 55 and I invite attorney Ross uh
 
05:18:15.150 --> 05:18:15.160 align:start position:0%
to um review this section with the
 
05:18:15.160 --> 05:18:16.750 align:start position:0%
to um review this section with the
committee

05:18:16.750 --> 05:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:18:19.948 --> 05:18:19.958 align:start position:0%
Ross thank you again um this peer
 
05:18:22.670 --> 05:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
support section is codifying the
 
05:18:25.590 --> 05:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
confidentiality requirements for the
 
05:18:27.910 --> 05:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
peer support program that DCF has
 
05:18:30.750 --> 05:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
developed to support and maintain uh
 
05:18:32.868 --> 05:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
healthy work work force um as many of
 
05:18:35.070 --> 05:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
you know over the last few years we've
 
05:18:37.788 --> 05:18:37.798 align:start position:0%
been trying to to grow that Workforce
 
05:18:42.150 --> 05:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
and decrease um the training folks and
 
05:18:44.470 --> 05:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
having them leave shortly after they're
 
05:18:47.750 --> 05:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
they're up and running um this portion
 
05:18:51.030 --> 05:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill mirrors the provision that
 
05:18:53.948 --> 05:18:53.958 align:start position:0%
is available for First Responders who
 
05:18:57.948 --> 05:18:57.958 align:start position:0%
are exposed to um crisis and Trauma in
 
05:19:01.390 --> 05:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
their jobs and we feel that this is
 
05:19:04.070 --> 05:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
important support for our staff who are
 
05:19:06.230 --> 05:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
working with families day in and day out
 
05:19:08.670 --> 05:19:08.680 align:start position:0%
and we'd ask that you provide them with
 
05:19:11.628 --> 05:19:11.638 align:start position:0%
the same um confidentiality so that they
 
05:19:14.030 --> 05:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
can seek the help that they need when
 
05:19:16.030 --> 05:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
they're exposed to situations through
 
05:19:19.230 --> 05:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
the course of their job and I'm happy to
 
05:19:28.270 --> 05:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:30.590 --> 05:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
section and Mr chair if there's no
 
05:19:32.830 --> 05:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
questions at that point if I could have
 
05:19:36.230 --> 05:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
attorney Ross also continue on page 30
 
05:19:38.708 --> 05:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
uh starting at line 31 this is section
 
05:19:41.788 --> 05:19:41.798 align:start position:0%
56 of the bill again page 30 line 31
 
05:19:44.150 --> 05:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
section 56 of the bill and it deals with
 
05:19:46.110 --> 05:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
Contracting or procurement for services
 
05:19:47.510 --> 05:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
through our division for children youth
 
05:19:47.520 --> 05:19:48.590 align:start position:0%
through our division for children youth
and

05:19:48.590 --> 05:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:19:53.310 --> 05:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
continue thank you um this
 
05:19:59.390 --> 05:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
section codifies the work that we're
 
05:20:02.350 --> 05:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
doing moving toward
 
05:20:05.190 --> 05:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
um contracted residential providers
 
05:20:07.390 --> 05:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
rather than vendored service providers
 
05:20:12.990 --> 05:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
and will allow us to tailor the um the
 
05:20:15.150 --> 05:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
the contracts and the services to meet
 
05:20:17.910 --> 05:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
the specific needs of the population
 
05:20:22.670 --> 05:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing and um move away from
 
05:20:24.430 --> 05:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
more of the one- siiz fits-all it's
 
05:20:25.948 --> 05:20:25.958 align:start position:0%
consistent with the work that's being
 
05:20:27.470 --> 05:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
done with system of care and the other
 
05:20:29.708 --> 05:20:29.718 align:start position:0%
system redesign and it's it's purely
 
05:20:31.150 --> 05:20:31.160 align:start position:0%
codifying that we're moving toward that
 
05:20:33.270 --> 05:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
that Contracting
 
05:20:35.708 --> 05:20:35.718 align:start position:0%
model and Mr chair that would then take
 
05:20:38.868 --> 05:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
us to page 31 line three section 57 of
 
05:20:41.350 --> 05:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
the bill and with attorney Ros still on
 
05:20:44.430 --> 05:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
this this is part of the cleaning up of
 
05:20:46.830 --> 05:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
either outdated redundant or unnecessary
 
05:20:48.708 --> 05:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
reports and this one relates to
 
05:20:50.548 --> 05:20:50.558 align:start position:0%
informational materials relating to
 
05:20:52.470 --> 05:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
missing children so I would just invite
 
05:20:54.830 --> 05:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
attorney Ross if she had any commentary
 
05:20:56.990 --> 05:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh in support of why that language is no
 
05:20:59.310 --> 05:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
longer needed or the
 
05:21:02.270 --> 05:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
report yes
 
05:21:06.190 --> 05:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
thank you other than it was um a very
 
05:21:10.070 --> 05:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
old statutory requirement and has
 
05:21:12.150 --> 05:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
essentially been replaced with the work
 
05:21:13.230 --> 05:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
that we're doing with our human
 
05:21:15.030 --> 05:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
trafficking position and some of the
 
05:21:17.270 --> 05:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
other more upto-date reporting that
 
05:21:18.628 --> 05:21:18.638 align:start position:0%
we're doing we don't we don't believe
 
05:21:20.868 --> 05:21:20.878 align:start position:0%
it's a necessary reporting requirement
 
05:21:23.708 --> 05:21:23.718 align:start position:0%
and there's um other information that is
 
05:21:26.190 --> 05:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
more readily available and and more
 
05:21:28.390 --> 05:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
useful at this
 
05:21:31.310 --> 05:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
time Mr chair that will take us to
 
05:21:34.270 --> 05:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
sections 58 through 60 which all relate
 
05:21:36.110 --> 05:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
to each other around developmental
 
05:21:38.670 --> 05:21:38.680 align:start position:0%
services and we have attorney Melissa St
 
05:21:40.990 --> 05:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
Seer with us you may recall your
 
05:21:42.670 --> 05:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
committee had a retain bill that you
 
05:21:44.750 --> 05:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
worked on considerably so pieces of this
 
05:21:46.990 --> 05:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
actually relate somewhat back to the
 
05:21:48.990 --> 05:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
good works that you folks did uh within
 
05:21:51.150 --> 05:21:51.160 align:start position:0%
the last uh couple of sessions as it
 
05:21:53.310 --> 05:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
relates to uh gaps in Services
 
05:21:55.110 --> 05:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
particularly for children uh between the
 
05:21:58.390 --> 05:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
ages of 18 and 21 uh and and needing
 
05:22:00.628 --> 05:22:00.638 align:start position:0%
these particular services so um I would
 
05:22:03.670 --> 05:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
turn over at at your direction Mr chair
 
05:22:06.070 --> 05:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
to attorney St sier at this
 
05:22:10.350 --> 05:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
time attorney St sier thank you so
 
05:22:14.350 --> 05:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
much the sections 58 through 60 relate
 
05:22:17.788 --> 05:22:17.798 align:start position:0%
to RC 171a which is our funding uh
 
05:22:20.590 --> 05:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for our developmental
 
05:22:23.990 --> 05:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities and acquire brain disorder
 
05:22:26.708 --> 05:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
uh services that are provided by the
 
05:22:29.830 --> 05:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
department there are uh sections 58 and
 
05:22:33.670 --> 05:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
60 are clean up up uh section
 
05:22:37.510 --> 05:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
59 was a uh the department had
 
05:22:38.910 --> 05:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
identified that there was a gap in
 
05:22:42.310 --> 05:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
funding for those aged 18 to 21 there
 
05:22:44.390 --> 05:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
were certain services such as housing
 
05:22:47.430 --> 05:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
that were not included in in the funding
 
05:22:49.788 --> 05:22:49.798 align:start position:0%
um as I as as written as the current
 
05:22:52.990 --> 05:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
statute is written and therefore we had
 
05:22:57.150 --> 05:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
requested that the funding for those
 
05:22:59.510 --> 05:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
individuals for that age group for 18 to
 
05:23:04.590 --> 05:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
21 be uh included in in this change The
 
05:23:07.830 --> 05:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
Advocates uh other stakeholders have uh
 
05:23:10.750 --> 05:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
have some concerns around those so this
 
05:23:13.310 --> 05:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
language was changed that individuals
 
05:23:14.948 --> 05:23:14.958 align:start position:0%
from area agencies the Department of
 
05:23:17.750 --> 05:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
Education the DRC and others would as
 
05:23:19.110 --> 05:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
well as the department obviously would
 
05:23:22.830 --> 05:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
get together um and discuss the uh aged
 
05:23:27.270 --> 05:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
18 to 21 the in and um come up with
 
05:23:29.750 --> 05:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
potential language for future
 
05:23:32.948 --> 05:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
legislation um uh and and resolution and
 
05:23:40.948 --> 05:23:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:43.510 --> 05:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
you and Mr chair if there's no questions
 
05:23:45.868 --> 05:23:45.878 align:start position:0%
for attorney Saints here at this time uh
 
05:23:49.030 --> 05:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
that takes us to uh line 26 on the same
 
05:23:53.390 --> 05:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
page page 31 which is um section 61 you
 
05:23:55.270 --> 05:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
may recall this relates back to section
 
05:23:57.470 --> 05:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
one of the bill on the dedicated funds
 
05:23:59.230 --> 05:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
cleanup this is the housing of the
 
05:24:02.350 --> 05:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
language within the the um uh enabling
 
05:24:03.590 --> 05:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
legislation for the fund for the
 
05:24:05.590 --> 05:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
domestic violence Grant so this is just
 
05:24:07.788 --> 05:24:07.798 align:start position:0%
the reciprocal cross reference to that
 
05:24:10.708 --> 05:24:10.718 align:start position:0%
those funds section 62 is the grant
 
05:24:13.548 --> 05:24:13.558 align:start position:0%
Workforce program and uh and represent
 
05:24:15.150 --> 05:24:15.160 align:start position:0%
Weber uh acknowledged from the
 
05:24:17.030 --> 05:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
questioning that she had with Senator
 
05:24:18.948 --> 05:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
Bradley that it does in fact what it
 
05:24:21.628 --> 05:24:21.638 align:start position:0%
says it does here relative to uh no
 
05:24:23.190 --> 05:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
requirement if there's no funding and
 
05:24:25.150 --> 05:24:25.160 align:start position:0%
it's only about the grant Workforce
 
05:24:28.070 --> 05:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
program not uh the enhanced Medicaid uh
 
05:24:31.230 --> 05:24:31.240 align:start position:0%
whatsoever so uh that then if there's no
 
05:24:35.750 --> 05:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
questions takes us to uh page 32 line 18
 
05:24:38.390 --> 05:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
section 63 of the bill relative to
 
05:24:42.190 --> 05:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
health facilities lure and uh and so
 
05:24:45.670 --> 05:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
what this section does um on Section 63
 
05:24:48.510 --> 05:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
is it cleans up a a rare and I'll repeat
 
05:24:51.350 --> 05:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
that a rare scribers error by the office
 
05:24:53.470 --> 05:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
of legislative services that last
 
05:24:56.910 --> 05:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
session they passed legislation to um
 
05:25:00.750 --> 05:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
better identify the um appeal process
 
05:25:02.030 --> 05:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
and the standards that the department
 
05:25:05.910 --> 05:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
utilizes around special Healthcare lure
 
05:25:09.270 --> 05:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
and so the problem with the bill as it
 
05:25:12.948 --> 05:25:12.958 align:start position:0%
was enacted that the uh effective date
 
05:25:15.070 --> 05:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
for repealing the old manner for the
 
05:25:19.070 --> 05:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
review happens on July 1st of 2021 and
 
05:25:22.548 --> 05:25:22.558 align:start position:0%
the new standard to be applied was
 
05:25:25.590 --> 05:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
effective on July 1st of 20120 so we
 
05:25:27.670 --> 05:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
just need to align that the old way of
 
05:25:30.110 --> 05:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
doing things needed to end at the same
 
05:25:32.590 --> 05:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
time uh contemporaneous with the new way
 
05:25:35.030 --> 05:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
of approaching the lure we do have
 
05:25:38.270 --> 05:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
attorney uh St Seer who worked very very
 
05:25:40.310 --> 05:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
closely on this legislation and I would
 
05:25:42.948 --> 05:25:42.958 align:start position:0%
invite her uh to add any commentary
 
05:25:44.708 --> 05:25:44.718 align:start position:0%
because I gave you the very high level
 
05:25:46.430 --> 05:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do here relative to
 
05:25:47.868 --> 05:25:47.878 align:start position:0%
an effective date that just need to be
 
05:25:49.910 --> 05:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
changed attorney
 
05:25:52.470 --> 05:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
sing uh I don't I I don't know if I have
 
05:25:56.590 --> 05:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
much more to add I um the you know just
 
05:25:58.628 --> 05:25:58.638 align:start position:0%
having the two the two Provisions in in
 
05:26:00.270 --> 05:26:00.280 align:start position:0%
contradiction of each other they they
 
05:26:02.270 --> 05:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
can't both stand both of those
 
05:26:04.670 --> 05:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
Provisions can't stand um together and
 
05:26:06.510 --> 05:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
and actually make sense and and can't be
 
05:26:09.830 --> 05:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
executed so this this cleans that up um
 
05:26:11.990 --> 05:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
and so I think that's that's all we need
 
05:26:13.430 --> 05:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
to tell you but I'm certainly happy to
 
05:26:15.310 --> 05:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
05:26:18.628 --> 05:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
questions so um chair chairman the the
 
05:26:21.548 --> 05:26:21.558 align:start position:0%
next um section is on line 22 and it
 
05:26:24.948 --> 05:26:24.958 align:start position:0%
relates to section uh 64 under milk
 
05:26:26.948 --> 05:26:26.958 align:start position:0%
sanitation I do have if there are
 
05:26:28.750 --> 05:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
questions for the committee uh Miss
 
05:26:31.948 --> 05:26:31.958 align:start position:0%
Colleen Smith who is just incredible
 
05:26:33.430 --> 05:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
person who works in our food Protection
 
05:26:35.350 --> 05:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
Services if there are questions but
 
05:26:37.150 --> 05:26:37.160 align:start position:0%
essentially we just need to qu clarify
 
05:26:39.150 --> 05:26:39.160 align:start position:0%
the term of wash stations as it relates
 
05:26:41.628 --> 05:26:41.638 align:start position:0%
to uh you know the sanitation of milk
 
05:26:44.310 --> 05:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
trucks that transport uh milk and that
 
05:26:47.310 --> 05:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
also relates to uh section 65 of the
 
05:26:49.708 --> 05:26:49.718 align:start position:0%
bill and this gets back to our
 
05:26:51.948 --> 05:26:51.958 align:start position:0%
conversation that we had on dedicated
 
05:26:54.590 --> 05:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
funds so this is just one of those items
 
05:26:56.628 --> 05:26:56.638 align:start position:0%
part of the dedicated funds cleanup as
 
05:26:58.110 --> 05:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
it relates to the following section
 
05:27:05.948 --> 05:27:05.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:09.910 --> 05:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
page that takes us to page 34 line 27
 
05:27:13.590 --> 05:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
again that's page 34 uh line 27 as it
 
05:27:16.990 --> 05:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
relates to section 67 Guardians and
 
05:27:19.190 --> 05:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
conservators this is the corresponding
 
05:27:21.788 --> 05:27:21.798 align:start position:0%
change to the jurisdictional amount for
 
05:27:24.590 --> 05:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh Estates that are uh minimal Estates
 
05:27:26.510 --> 05:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
from $5,000 to
 
05:27:29.990 --> 05:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
$10,000 uh for that particular threshold
 
05:27:34.430 --> 05:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
and then that takes us uh to page um 35
 
05:27:37.708 --> 05:27:37.718 align:start position:0%
uh section 68 uh dealing with the
 
05:27:39.750 --> 05:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
achievement statutes under unclaimed
 
05:27:42.070 --> 05:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
property and abandoned property also the
 
05:27:44.590 --> 05:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
same jurisdictional change from $5,000
 
05:27:48.750 --> 05:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
to $10,000 throughout section 669 is the
 
05:27:50.590 --> 05:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
applicability on the effective date so
 
05:27:52.070 --> 05:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
that it's upon when the Court's looking
 
05:27:53.868 --> 05:27:53.878 align:start position:0%
at it it's upon when those affidavit or
 
05:27:57.788 --> 05:27:57.798 align:start position:0%
claims are filed um and that takes us to
 
05:28:00.750 --> 05:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
section 70 relative to Retirement System
 
05:28:02.990 --> 05:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
and this is the third and final piece as
 
05:28:06.030 --> 05:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
it relates to recruitment of qualified
 
05:28:07.390 --> 05:28:07.400 align:start position:0%
positions for our bureau chief for
 
05:28:09.548 --> 05:28:09.558 align:start position:0%
emergency preparedness in response and
 
05:28:12.390 --> 05:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
allowing those that are in group two uh
 
05:28:14.310 --> 05:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
specifically to be able to apply for
 
05:28:16.990 --> 05:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
those jobs without um losing their their
 
05:28:19.628 --> 05:28:19.638 align:start position:0%
group two membership uh that now takes
 
05:28:21.708 --> 05:28:21.718 align:start position:0%
us to the Department of Health and
 
05:28:24.830 --> 05:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
services uh plan for uh
 
05:28:27.948 --> 05:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
legislation uh and uh and so this final
 
05:28:29.510 --> 05:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
section here was an accommodation
 
05:28:31.548 --> 05:28:31.558 align:start position:0%
working with senator Bradley and Senator
 
05:28:33.708 --> 05:28:33.718 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald as it related to Case
 
05:28:35.670 --> 05:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
Management Services and like earlier
 
05:28:37.788 --> 05:28:37.798 align:start position:0%
items working along with the hospital
 
05:28:39.430 --> 05:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
Association as it relates to emergency
 
05:28:41.868 --> 05:28:41.878 align:start position:0%
services this section allows us to work
 
05:28:43.628 --> 05:28:43.638 align:start position:0%
with uh the provider community and
 
05:28:45.548 --> 05:28:45.558 align:start position:0%
agencies around case management and to
 
05:28:48.788 --> 05:28:48.798 align:start position:0%
report on November 1st of 2021 with
 
05:28:50.990 --> 05:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
ideas I do think I inadvertently did
 
05:28:53.310 --> 05:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
skip over one section that dealt with
 
05:28:56.910 --> 05:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the a transfer from our agency to
 
05:28:59.470 --> 05:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
the department uh rather the office of
 
05:29:01.670 --> 05:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
professional licensure certification as
 
05:29:03.948 --> 05:29:03.958 align:start position:0%
it relates to training for the
 
05:29:07.110 --> 05:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
administration of epinephrine and uh as
 
05:29:08.990 --> 05:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
most of you are aware there are three
 
05:29:10.470 --> 05:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
different settings that are set up in
 
05:29:13.150 --> 05:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
current statute for the administration
 
05:29:15.910 --> 05:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
of um epinephrine and the first setting
 
05:29:18.830 --> 05:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
is related through K through 12 schools
 
05:29:20.948 --> 05:29:20.958 align:start position:0%
uh and then there's a whole section uh
 
05:29:22.830 --> 05:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
that deals with postsecondary so at
 
05:29:24.670 --> 05:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
universities what needs to be done
 
05:29:26.110 --> 05:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
relative to the training and
 
05:29:29.350 --> 05:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
administration of epinephrine or epipens
 
05:29:31.230 --> 05:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
and there's a third that is a
 
05:29:33.510 --> 05:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
non-academic uh setting such as
 
05:29:36.070 --> 05:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
Appalachian Mountain Club Lodge or or
 
05:29:39.548 --> 05:29:39.558 align:start position:0%
other uh settings uh that uh may need
 
05:29:42.910 --> 05:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
the use of an epinephrine uh or EpiPen
 
05:29:44.548 --> 05:29:44.558 align:start position:0%
that currently was housed within our
 
05:29:46.628 --> 05:29:46.638 align:start position:0%
agency the prior to that I discussed we
 
05:29:48.070 --> 05:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
certainly provide information were
 
05:29:49.948 --> 05:29:49.958 align:start position:0%
resource but they were administered by a
 
05:29:52.190 --> 05:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
different state agency uh the department
 
05:29:54.830 --> 05:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
of Ed um for for the most part as it
 
05:29:56.948 --> 05:29:56.958 align:start position:0%
related to the educational settings this
 
05:30:00.350 --> 05:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
one however uh had our agency tagged
 
05:30:01.750 --> 05:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
with being the ones who have to
 
05:30:03.628 --> 05:30:03.638 align:start position:0%
administer the training for this program
 
05:30:06.548 --> 05:30:06.558 align:start position:0%
and a very collaborative discussion we
 
05:30:08.830 --> 05:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
had with the office of professional Li
 
05:30:11.150 --> 05:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
Insurance certification they recognized
 
05:30:12.990 --> 05:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
and agreed that it was better suited
 
05:30:15.750 --> 05:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
with them under the Board of Medicine to
 
05:30:17.708 --> 05:30:17.718 align:start position:0%
provide direction for training for the
 
05:30:21.190 --> 05:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
use uh of epinephrine pens by uh
 
05:30:24.270 --> 05:30:24.280 align:start position:0%
physicians in those non um
 
05:30:26.788 --> 05:30:26.798 align:start position:0%
non-educational settings so it was a
 
05:30:29.670 --> 05:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
great um exchange we worked along uh
 
05:30:31.990 --> 05:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
with uh attorney uh uh um Lindsay
 
05:30:34.830 --> 05:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
Courtney uh who is the uh executive
 
05:30:37.510 --> 05:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
director for oplc I I would invite uh
 
05:30:39.628 --> 05:30:39.638 align:start position:0%
attorney Melissa Saint Seer uh if she
 
05:30:40.990 --> 05:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
had any other thoughts because she had
 
05:30:43.150 --> 05:30:43.160 align:start position:0%
worked along with others in the
 
05:30:46.030 --> 05:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
department around that
 
05:30:48.190 --> 05:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
section I I don't have any additional
 
05:30:51.270 --> 05:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
thoughts thank you John well Mr chair um
 
05:30:52.948 --> 05:30:52.958 align:start position:0%
it did we did take us a little bit
 
05:30:54.510 --> 05:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
longer and I think we probably did even
 
05:30:56.190 --> 05:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
a more thoughtful job with your
 
05:30:58.110 --> 05:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
committee on the initial walkthrough uh
 
05:30:59.670 --> 05:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
but we were able to do this uh time
 
05:31:03.470 --> 05:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
check here within one hour of over 26 to
 
05:31:06.310 --> 05:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
34 different legislative initiatives so
 
05:31:07.670 --> 05:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
at this time if there are questions from
 
05:31:10.190 --> 05:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
the committee either I or others are
 
05:31:12.510 --> 05:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
certainly available to feeli them uh as
 
05:31:15.110 --> 05:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
as as needed thank
 
05:31:18.510 --> 05:31:18.520 align:start position:0%

have two questions um on page one um
 
05:31:32.680 --> 05:31:33.628 align:start position:0%
have two questions um on page one um
number

05:31:33.628 --> 05:31:33.638 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:31:33.638 --> 05:31:36.708 align:start position:0%
number
five

05:31:36.708 --> 05:31:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:39.670 --> 05:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned parity between mental
 
05:31:43.110 --> 05:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
health and physical health services and
 
05:31:47.350 --> 05:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
emergency um rooms is this is this
 
05:31:50.110 --> 05:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
another attempt to deal with the
 
05:31:53.830 --> 05:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:56.750 --> 05:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
crisis and Mr chair in in response to
 
05:31:58.590 --> 05:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
represent Shapiro's question if we could
 
05:32:01.270 --> 05:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
recognize attorney Melissa
 
05:32:03.788 --> 05:32:03.798 align:start position:0%
uh on that question from represent
 
05:32:07.430 --> 05:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
Shapiro attorne s thank you represent
 
05:32:09.670 --> 05:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
Shapiro for your question the
 
05:32:12.430 --> 05:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
Department's goal in this is uh in this
 
05:32:14.190 --> 05:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
legislation was
 
05:32:17.110 --> 05:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
to allow for mental health parody in our
 
05:32:19.548 --> 05:32:19.558 align:start position:0%
hospitals when somebody arrives at the
 
05:32:22.030 --> 05:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
emergency room to receive Services
 
05:32:24.110 --> 05:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
whether it is a mental health or a
 
05:32:26.310 --> 05:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
physical health that they receive the
 
05:32:30.150 --> 05:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
same care attention and level of care
 
05:32:32.628 --> 05:32:32.638 align:start position:0%
that they would they would no matter whe
 
05:32:34.230 --> 05:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
whether it is physical or mental health
 
05:32:38.070 --> 05:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
so that is that is the whole reason
 
05:32:40.270 --> 05:32:40.280 align:start position:0%
behind the legislation if it is if it
 
05:32:43.030 --> 05:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
assists with the ER boarding crisis um
 
05:32:47.548 --> 05:32:47.558 align:start position:0%
wonderful but but it really is to ensure
 
05:32:52.070 --> 05:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:54.868 --> 05:32:54.878 align:start position:0%
up first I would say if it if there
 
05:32:57.270 --> 05:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
really if parody is created that would
 
05:33:00.868 --> 05:33:00.878 align:start position:0%
certainly be um a help because right now
 
05:33:02.750 --> 05:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
A lot of people are getting very limited
 
05:33:04.948 --> 05:33:04.958 align:start position:0%
or no U Mental Health Services in the
 
05:33:07.670 --> 05:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
emergency room I'd like to move on to um
 
05:33:07.680 --> 05:33:09.110 align:start position:0%
emergency room I'd like to move on to um
page

05:33:09.110 --> 05:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
page
 
05:33:09.120 --> 05:33:11.868 align:start position:0%
page
32

05:33:11.868 --> 05:33:11.878 align:start position:0%
32
 
05:33:16.470 --> 05:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
um the section about um I guess it would
 
05:33:16.480 --> 05:33:17.190 align:start position:0%
um the section about um I guess it would
be

05:33:17.190 --> 05:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:33:21.670 --> 05:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
62 on actually starts on 31 the section
 
05:33:26.270 --> 05:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
about um work in community engagement
 
05:33:29.150 --> 05:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
program with expanded Medicaid and I am
 
05:33:32.070 --> 05:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
just curious why it is written the way
 
05:33:34.708 --> 05:33:34.718 align:start position:0%
it is written um to say if the work in
 
05:33:38.788 --> 05:33:38.798 align:start position:0%
community engagement waiver is held that
 
05:33:41.670 --> 05:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
invalid when my understanding is that it
 
05:33:47.590 --> 05:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:49.628 --> 05:33:49.638 align:start position:0%
Administration and Mr chair if I may
 
05:33:52.270 --> 05:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
respond to represent Shapiro's
 
05:33:55.670 --> 05:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
question is is absolutely correct around
 
05:33:57.788 --> 05:33:57.798 align:start position:0%
that we just need to make sure that we
 
05:34:00.390 --> 05:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
clarify that within the context
 
05:34:02.470 --> 05:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
of the proposed legislation and and
 
05:34:04.350 --> 05:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
certainly is a timing issue we put
 
05:34:06.110 --> 05:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
together this legislative proposal back
 
05:34:07.788 --> 05:34:07.798 align:start position:0%
in the fall so that is some of the
 
05:34:10.590 --> 05:34:10.600 align:start position:0%
factors that are involved uh we also I
 
05:34:12.788 --> 05:34:12.798 align:start position:0%
conc certainly have director Chris Sello
 
05:34:17.030 --> 05:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
who is at um um at um a telephone ready
 
05:34:18.470 --> 05:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
standpoint if you need additional
 
05:34:19.708 --> 05:34:19.718 align:start position:0%
information beyond that and certainly
 
05:34:22.070 --> 05:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
could have her discuss with you offline
 
05:34:23.708 --> 05:34:23.718 align:start position:0%
uh those services that are in fact still
 
05:34:26.230 --> 05:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
being provided uh through the uh
 
05:34:27.868 --> 05:34:27.878 align:start position:0%
Department of Employment Security to
 
05:34:32.670 --> 05:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:40.350 --> 05:34:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:46.270 --> 05:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:49.990 --> 05:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
repres sorry about that uh now I have
 
05:34:52.628 --> 05:34:52.638 align:start position:0%
questions raised by the answer to
 
05:34:55.670 --> 05:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
05:34:58.948 --> 05:34:58.958 align:start position:0%
because I'm not understanding Mr
 
05:35:01.590 --> 05:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
Williams what you meant when you said
 
05:35:04.948 --> 05:35:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:04.958 --> 05:35:09.788 align:start position:0%
 
still

05:35:09.788 --> 05:35:09.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:12.948 --> 05:35:12.958 align:start position:0%
supports I I guess my brain has bounced
 
05:35:15.390 --> 05:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
with respect to this provision because
 
05:35:17.750 --> 05:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering what supports the granite
 
05:35:21.470 --> 05:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
Workforce program is
 
05:35:21.480 --> 05:35:23.350 align:start position:0%
Workforce program is
currently

05:35:23.350 --> 05:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:35:26.150 --> 05:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
providing because I thought it that what
 
05:35:30.510 --> 05:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
we were talking about was the um
 
05:35:31.750 --> 05:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
the work
 
05:35:34.150 --> 05:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
requirement so there are there are
 
05:35:36.430 --> 05:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
supports in addition to the work
 
05:35:38.708 --> 05:35:38.718 align:start position:0%
requirement that are provided through
 
05:35:42.190 --> 05:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
this program and they would also be
 
05:35:46.868 --> 05:35:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:49.750 --> 05:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
really provision yeah we we do have
 
05:35:52.190 --> 05:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
director Litman who is at the ready to
 
05:35:55.788 --> 05:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
address uh represent Weber's
 
05:35:58.270 --> 05:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
question and then just Mr chair I do
 
05:36:01.750 --> 05:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
have my original question on beyond
 
05:36:04.948 --> 05:36:04.958 align:start position:0%
that hopefully um this is Henry Litman
 
05:36:06.430 --> 05:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director hopefully I can
 
05:36:08.670 --> 05:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
clarify here I think connected to
 
05:36:10.110 --> 05:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro's original
 
05:36:12.070 --> 05:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
question connecting to representative
 
05:36:14.390 --> 05:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
Weber's question I I think that issue
 
05:36:19.190 --> 05:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
here is that um CMS has withdrawn the
 
05:36:21.070 --> 05:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
waiver with respect to the community
 
05:36:24.030 --> 05:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
engagement requirement um there is
 
05:36:25.868 --> 05:36:25.878 align:start position:0%
however still a Supreme Court case
 
05:36:30.230 --> 05:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
that's in um that has not been dispos of
 
05:36:33.548 --> 05:36:33.558 align:start position:0%
it's technically held in a bance um it's
 
05:36:37.390 --> 05:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
it's in all likelihood um you know not
 
05:36:39.190 --> 05:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
going to potentially be heard but it's
 
05:36:41.310 --> 05:36:41.320 align:start position:0%
still an open case at the Supreme Court
 
05:36:42.670 --> 05:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
level is kind of where the community
 
05:36:47.270 --> 05:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
engagement stands um CMS has revoked the
 
05:36:49.708 --> 05:36:49.718 align:start position:0%
the 1115 waiver for Community engagement
 
05:36:51.460 --> 05:36:51.470 align:start position:0%
and the states where it had granted
 
05:36:51.470 --> 05:36:54.590 align:start position:0%
and the states where it had granted
[Music]

05:36:54.590 --> 05:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:57.390 --> 05:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
it Mr chair this is Melissa ster I can
 
05:36:58.948 --> 05:36:58.958 align:start position:0%
also I can also follow up a little bit
 
05:37:02.708 --> 05:37:02.718 align:start position:0%
more to that if if if you would like yes
 
05:37:03.990 --> 05:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
great thank you so
 
05:37:06.150 --> 05:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
much uh currently the way that the
 
05:37:08.948 --> 05:37:08.958 align:start position:0%
statute is written the granite Workforce
 
05:37:11.830 --> 05:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
program is a piece of the work and
 
05:37:15.190 --> 05:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
Community engagement that was created um
 
05:37:16.470 --> 05:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
although the working Community
 
05:37:18.910 --> 05:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
engagement has been withdrawn the
 
05:37:20.470 --> 05:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
approval for the wer waiver has been
 
05:37:21.948 --> 05:37:21.958 align:start position:0%
withdrawn the way that the statute is
 
05:37:24.070 --> 05:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
written it that doesn't subsequently
 
05:37:25.990 --> 05:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
also withdraw the granite Workforce
 
05:37:28.270 --> 05:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
program they're linked but our statute
 
05:37:30.628 --> 05:37:30.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't didn't link them enough enough
 
05:37:34.270 --> 05:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
to allow for if the community work
 
05:37:36.190 --> 05:37:36.200 align:start position:0%
requirement if the community engagement
 
05:37:38.110 --> 05:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
went away that the work Grant Workforce
 
05:37:41.030 --> 05:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
program also would so so we're trying to
 
05:37:43.270 --> 05:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
make that link because they are they are
 
05:37:45.548 --> 05:37:45.558 align:start position:0%
in fact linked but the statute didn't
 
05:37:48.390 --> 05:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
didn't quite make that link in addition
 
05:37:52.310 --> 05:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
the um New Hampshire employment security
 
05:37:56.868 --> 05:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
does have a role in some of the items
 
05:37:58.628 --> 05:37:58.638 align:start position:0%
that the granite Workforce program
 
05:37:58.638 --> 05:38:00.430 align:start position:0%
that the granite Workforce program
initially

05:38:00.430 --> 05:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
initially
 
05:38:03.708 --> 05:38:03.718 align:start position:0%
uh was created for and we've been
 
05:38:05.270 --> 05:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
working very closely with New Hampshire
 
05:38:08.510 --> 05:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
employment security to conduct some of
 
05:38:10.750 --> 05:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
those activities although the granite
 
05:38:12.910 --> 05:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce program is going going away
 
05:38:14.270 --> 05:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that the grant the
 
05:38:15.788 --> 05:38:15.798 align:start position:0%
community engagement requirements are
 
05:38:17.390 --> 05:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
going away New Hampshire employment
 
05:38:19.510 --> 05:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
security does continue to do some of the
 
05:38:22.990 --> 05:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
things that was uh conceptualized for
 
05:38:25.110 --> 05:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
the grant at work force program hope
 
05:38:25.120 --> 05:38:25.868 align:start position:0%
the grant at work force program hope
that

05:38:25.868 --> 05:38:25.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:38:29.110 --> 05:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
helps thank you and then Mr chair may I
 
05:38:32.430 --> 05:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
revert to my original question you may
 
05:38:33.910 --> 05:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you on a completely different
 
05:38:39.270 --> 05:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
subject to return to the group to the
 
05:38:41.670 --> 05:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
the folks who upon moving to
 
05:38:43.948 --> 05:38:43.958 align:start position:0%
administrative position can keep their
 
05:38:47.390 --> 05:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
group to Retirement Systems which I
 
05:38:49.990 --> 05:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
recall dealing with again and again
 
05:38:52.350 --> 05:38:52.360 align:start position:0%
every single time a new person was hired
 
05:38:54.990 --> 05:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
through Ed normally through
 
05:38:58.430 --> 05:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
Edna um how many positions are we
 
05:39:00.788 --> 05:39:00.798 align:start position:0%
talking about there was one I saw the
 
05:39:02.830 --> 05:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
reference to Homeland Security but are
 
05:39:05.350 --> 05:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
there other positions that these
 
05:39:09.270 --> 05:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
Provisions would uh apply to and how
 
05:39:12.830 --> 05:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
many positions total would it apply
 
05:39:15.628 --> 05:39:15.638 align:start position:0%
to and Mr chair I I this is John
 
05:39:18.548 --> 05:39:18.558 align:start position:0%
Williams I can respond to Rend Weber's
 
05:39:22.030 --> 05:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
question and so it actually only relates
 
05:39:25.030 --> 05:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
to one position that we're seeking
 
05:39:26.910 --> 05:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and the title for that
 
05:39:29.190 --> 05:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
position as you'll see in the first
 
05:39:30.510 --> 05:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
section section that I'm trying to catch
 
05:39:33.990 --> 05:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
up very quickly uh to where it's located
 
05:39:36.350 --> 05:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
deals with a bureau chief essentially
 
05:39:39.670 --> 05:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
for emergency preparedness uh within the
 
05:39:42.310 --> 05:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
division for p uh division for public
 
05:39:44.070 --> 05:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
health services so it is only one
 
05:39:46.590 --> 05:39:46.600 align:start position:0%
position however because the recruitment
 
05:39:49.548 --> 05:39:49.558 align:start position:0%
could come from the um Department of
 
05:39:52.670 --> 05:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
Safety from a Emergency Management
 
05:39:54.590 --> 05:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
person from that entity there's a
 
05:39:57.150 --> 05:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
specific provision in RSA 100 that
 
05:40:00.230 --> 05:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
relates specifically to what they call
 
05:40:02.590 --> 05:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
Firefighters for one a better word
 
05:40:04.830 --> 05:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
there's another section also in section
 
05:40:06.990 --> 05:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
100 that relates to law enforcement and
 
05:40:09.948 --> 05:40:09.958 align:start position:0%
and police and so that section also
 
05:40:12.350 --> 05:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
needed to be uh amended so that it would
 
05:40:14.830 --> 05:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
allow for the Recruitment and Retention
 
05:40:17.110 --> 05:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
of group two if they came from either
 
05:40:19.948 --> 05:40:19.958 align:start position:0%
one of those two um uh
 
05:40:23.628 --> 05:40:23.638 align:start position:0%
areas and then and then that I'm sorry
 
05:40:25.150 --> 05:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
that completes my
 
05:40:30.948 --> 05:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
answer thank you so the maximum
 
05:40:34.150 --> 05:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh exposure to the concerns which might
 
05:40:37.868 --> 05:40:37.878 align:start position:0%
be expressed on behalf of the retirement
 
05:40:42.510 --> 05:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
system um goes only to one specific
 
05:40:44.830 --> 05:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
position no matter how many different
 
05:40:46.548 --> 05:40:46.558 align:start position:0%
places you have to put in the statute
 
05:40:48.030 --> 05:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
depending on where they're coming from
 
05:40:53.150 --> 05:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:55.210 --> 05:40:55.220 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
05:40:55.220 --> 05:40:58.230 align:start position:0%
you any further
[Music]

05:40:58.230 --> 05:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:40:58.240 --> 05:41:08.590 align:start position:0%
[Music]
questions

05:41:08.590 --> 05:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:11.990 --> 05:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
wow thank you chairman um I'm not quite
 
05:41:15.270 --> 05:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
sure who would handle this um I was very
 
05:41:17.310 --> 05:41:17.320 align:start position:0%
interested in the interstate compact for
 
05:41:19.190 --> 05:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
the placement of children since it is a
 
05:41:21.590 --> 05:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
a rather large section of this Omnibus
 
05:41:21.600 --> 05:41:23.390 align:start position:0%
a rather large section of this Omnibus
Bill

05:41:23.390 --> 05:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:41:26.670 --> 05:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
um just for some background information
 
05:41:30.990 --> 05:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
who developed this and um how many
 
05:41:34.628 --> 05:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
states are already in it who who sets
 
05:41:37.230 --> 05:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
the um standards
 
05:41:41.350 --> 05:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
for uh the home visits and placements
 
05:41:43.990 --> 05:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
and all of
 
05:41:46.948 --> 05:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
that and Mr chair if we could invite
 
05:41:49.670 --> 05:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
attorney Rebecca Ross to come in and to
 
05:41:51.430 --> 05:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
respond to those questions but as
 
05:41:53.708 --> 05:41:53.718 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley said in his overview of
 
05:41:55.670 --> 05:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
some of the key sections that there
 
05:41:57.948 --> 05:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
already is existing law that it relates
 
05:42:00.230 --> 05:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
to the compact with this does is it
 
05:42:02.468 --> 05:42:02.478 align:start position:0%
upate it updates the the current law
 
05:42:04.750 --> 05:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
that has not been updated in some time
 
05:42:07.590 --> 05:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
so it's not creating a new law out there
 
05:42:09.868 --> 05:42:09.878 align:start position:0%
and it also requires that a certain
 
05:42:11.868 --> 05:42:11.878 align:start position:0%
number of states have to sign on and
 
05:42:14.548 --> 05:42:14.558 align:start position:0%
ratify this for it to be to be effective
 
05:42:16.070 --> 05:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
but I think attorney Ross is in a much
 
05:42:18.230 --> 05:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
better position to provide a level of
 
05:42:20.948 --> 05:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
detail to representative fom's uh very
 
05:42:20.958 --> 05:42:23.628 align:start position:0%
detail to representative fom's uh very
good

05:42:23.628 --> 05:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:27.230 --> 05:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
question good afternoon thank you John
 
05:42:29.510 --> 05:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative for for the
 
05:42:34.628 --> 05:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
question this um is drafted by a group
 
05:42:38.390 --> 05:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
that all of the states belong to um it
 
05:42:43.070 --> 05:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
is as John said updating um the current
 
05:42:47.070 --> 05:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
version that we adopted into law in
 
05:42:52.868 --> 05:42:52.878 align:start position:0%
1985 um it provides for the adoption of
 
05:42:56.750 --> 05:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
regulations once the requisite 35 states
 
05:42:58.628 --> 05:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
have adopted so the states that have
 
05:43:01.030 --> 05:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
joined will work together to come up
 
05:43:04.708 --> 05:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
with um the regulations to implement the
 
05:43:07.270 --> 05:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
act so we don't have those yet but we
 
05:43:10.150 --> 05:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
would be a participating state in
 
05:43:13.670 --> 05:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
developing the specific regulations for
 
05:43:16.030 --> 05:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
the different parts of the program we
 
05:43:21.310 --> 05:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
would still be um like we are now using
 
05:43:25.070 --> 05:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
our own foster care and adoption home
 
05:43:28.708 --> 05:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
study rules and doing things in New
 
05:43:30.628 --> 05:43:30.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way other states would still
 
05:43:33.070 --> 05:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
be using their process and it sets the
 
05:43:34.350 --> 05:43:34.360 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards and the
 
05:43:37.750 --> 05:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
obligations that are required um when
 
05:43:41.430 --> 05:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
working with the other states I hope
 
05:43:43.708 --> 05:43:43.718 align:start position:0%
that answers your
 
05:43:48.830 --> 05:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you um when the 37 States
 
05:43:52.548 --> 05:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
sign on first of all it's been since
 
05:43:55.590 --> 05:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
1985 so that's quite a few years and
 
05:43:59.150 --> 05:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
we're not at 37 States yet um is there
 
05:44:03.270 --> 05:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
um a hope to when that might happen and
 
05:44:06.350 --> 05:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
then also with that is once it does
 
05:44:09.990 --> 05:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
reach 37 states does it become a
 
05:44:13.310 --> 05:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
federal um program at that
 
05:44:16.030 --> 05:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
point um it doesn't become a federal
 
05:44:17.830 --> 05:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
program at that point it's still
 
05:44:20.190 --> 05:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
something that we as New Hampshire
 
05:44:26.070 --> 05:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
choose to be part of um but so since
 
05:44:29.110 --> 05:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
1985 we've had a version of the
 
05:44:30.750 --> 05:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
interstate compact for the placement of
 
05:44:33.110 --> 05:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
children on the books this proposed
 
05:44:36.270 --> 05:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
draft has not been um in the work since
 
05:44:39.310 --> 05:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
1985 this is more recent although um I
 
05:44:40.750 --> 05:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
don't have it in front of me it has been
 
05:44:43.190 --> 05:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
a number of years it stalled and there
 
05:44:46.708 --> 05:44:46.718 align:start position:0%
was um increased enthusiasm over the
 
05:44:48.230 --> 05:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
last couple years through the National
 
05:44:50.510 --> 05:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
Organization to to bring it back and
 
05:44:53.910 --> 05:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
work toward the electronic Communication
 
05:44:56.468 --> 05:44:56.478 align:start position:0%
System right now we do things by facts
 
05:44:58.590 --> 05:44:58.600 align:start position:0%
it's very slow a lot of things go back
 
05:45:01.548 --> 05:45:01.558 align:start position:0%
and forth by mail there are undue delays
 
05:45:03.110 --> 05:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a system in place
 
05:45:05.948 --> 05:45:05.958 align:start position:0%
to be able to communicate essentially in
 
05:45:09.190 --> 05:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
real time we also don't have um the
 
05:45:11.628 --> 05:45:11.638 align:start position:0%
current compact doesn't have any
 
05:45:14.310 --> 05:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
enforcable deadlines for other states so
 
05:45:18.030 --> 05:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
we could have a a child in New Hampshire
 
05:45:19.990 --> 05:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
with relatives that are in the best
 
05:45:22.030 --> 05:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
position to take care of that child in
 
05:45:26.070 --> 05:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
another state and um we are are at their
 
05:45:27.910 --> 05:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
whim as to when they complete that home
 
05:45:30.868 --> 05:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
study and get back to us this will will
 
05:45:33.190 --> 05:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
correct that and include um penalties
 
05:45:35.948 --> 05:45:35.958 align:start position:0%
for not cooperating and and working with
 
05:45:37.750 --> 05:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
States in a timely manner to get that
 
05:45:40.628 --> 05:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:44.310 --> 05:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
children representative gay thank you Mr
 
05:45:45.830 --> 05:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:45:48.670 --> 05:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
question and clarifying this um so I'll
 
05:45:50.430 --> 05:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
say some things and then you tell me
 
05:45:53.110 --> 05:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
whether I have this right or not
 
05:45:56.670 --> 05:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
currently we do have compacts maybe not
 
05:45:58.628 --> 05:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
called the compact that way but we do
 
05:46:01.110 --> 05:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
have arrangements with other states for
 
05:46:04.708 --> 05:46:04.718 align:start position:0%
transferring children to other places
 
05:46:06.350 --> 05:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
where they'd be better they have
 
05:46:09.708 --> 05:46:09.718 align:start position:0%
somebody to care for them but we don't
 
05:46:11.830 --> 05:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
have anything to hurry them up if
 
05:46:14.910 --> 05:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
they're if they have a long delay that's
 
05:46:17.310 --> 05:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
acceptable in their state we're stuck
 
05:46:19.548 --> 05:46:19.558 align:start position:0%
with that
 
05:46:22.910 --> 05:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to guess so that's question
 
05:46:25.750 --> 05:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
one the other question is this sounds
 
05:46:27.868 --> 05:46:27.878 align:start position:0%
like if we're talking about 37 States
 
05:46:31.468 --> 05:46:31.478 align:start position:0%
this sounds like a federally proposed
 
05:46:34.708 --> 05:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
program that just never has gotten the
 
05:46:40.310 --> 05:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
the 37 states to sign on which which
 
05:46:42.548 --> 05:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
seems to me a little strange since it
 
05:46:45.510 --> 05:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
would benefit people I don't understand
 
05:46:49.590 --> 05:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
why it requires all 37 before you can
 
05:46:53.070 --> 05:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
initiate the program so is that indeed a
 
05:46:57.708 --> 05:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:57.718 --> 05:47:01.030 align:start position:0%
 
requirements

05:47:01.030 --> 05:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:04.670 --> 05:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
no it right now we have RSA
 
05:47:08.510 --> 05:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
170a which is our current version of the
 
05:47:10.830 --> 05:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
interstate compact on the placement of
 
05:47:13.510 --> 05:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
children so we we do have one in place
 
05:47:15.788 --> 05:47:15.798 align:start position:0%
and absolutely that's what we operate
 
05:47:20.070 --> 05:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
under um and that that's what all of the
 
05:47:22.430 --> 05:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
states are operating under right now
 
05:47:25.030 --> 05:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
there's been a proposal through the
 
05:47:27.548 --> 05:47:27.558 align:start position:0%
states that are the are are members of
 
05:47:30.230 --> 05:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
this organization to update that and
 
05:47:33.548 --> 05:47:33.558 align:start position:0%
that's what this is so the decision was
 
05:47:36.030 --> 05:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
made that they we essentially need
 
05:47:38.430 --> 05:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the states to decide to
 
05:47:40.788 --> 05:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
move forward with the new program and
 
05:47:42.510 --> 05:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're in the process of
 
05:47:45.270 --> 05:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
right now is each state working with
 
05:47:47.628 --> 05:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
their own legislature to ratify these
 
05:47:50.868 --> 05:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
changes and as soon as there's
 
05:47:54.948 --> 05:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
essentially 2third then that would be
 
05:47:57.110 --> 05:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
operationalized until then there's not
 
05:47:59.390 --> 05:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
sufficient buyin for the state to update
 
05:48:02.628 --> 05:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
the process so that that's very common
 
05:48:05.910 --> 05:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
with these interstate compacts and and
 
05:48:08.788 --> 05:48:08.798 align:start position:0%
how they're developed and and
 
05:48:11.910 --> 05:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
operationalized and so um it doesn't it
 
05:48:13.990 --> 05:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it a federal program it
 
05:48:19.230 --> 05:48:19.240 align:start position:0%
does bring us into um compliance with
 
05:48:21.590 --> 05:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
how we we work with the feds for placing
 
05:48:24.030 --> 05:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
kids out of state but we are not out of
 
05:48:25.990 --> 05:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
compliance by operating on the old
 
05:48:29.270 --> 05:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
agreement either and this is this is a
 
05:48:31.788 --> 05:48:31.798 align:start position:0%
um a group of states working together
 
05:48:34.708 --> 05:48:34.718 align:start position:0%
rather than a federally mandated law
 
05:48:37.590 --> 05:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
that is being imposed on
 
05:48:42.310 --> 05:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
US Representative Felson thank you um
 
05:48:46.150 --> 05:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Miss Ross for taking our
 
05:48:48.830 --> 05:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
questions on this um it just it's
 
05:48:51.310 --> 05:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
something that uh definitely interests
 
05:48:55.590 --> 05:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
me because I I um used to live in Alaska
 
05:48:58.150 --> 05:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
and had to deal a lot with placement of
 
05:49:01.628 --> 05:49:01.638 align:start position:0%
native American children and that um
 
05:49:03.670 --> 05:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of a lot of bread tape
 
05:49:05.270 --> 05:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
involved in that so that's why this
 
05:49:08.990 --> 05:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
caught my eye but um what is the name of
 
05:49:13.030 --> 05:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
the organization that you all belong to
 
05:49:16.150 --> 05:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
that all all the states participating
 
05:49:17.830 --> 05:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
currently belong
 
05:49:21.190 --> 05:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
to the ICPC is through the American
 
05:49:24.830 --> 05:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
public Human Services Association or ASA
 
05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
um can you can you you said some letters
 
05:49:29.708 --> 05:49:29.718 align:start position:0%
there right at the beginning and I don't
 
05:49:33.548 --> 05:49:33.558 align:start position:0%
have those um American public Human
 
05:49:36.628 --> 05:49:36.638 align:start position:0%
Services Association
 
05:49:40.948 --> 05:49:40.958 align:start position:0%
apsa and I'm I have the link to um their
 
05:49:42.910 --> 05:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
web page and has the comparison of the
 
05:49:45.468 --> 05:49:45.478 align:start position:0%
old and the new version and some
 
05:49:47.390 --> 05:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
additional FAQs and information I'm
 
05:49:49.310 --> 05:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
happy to send that on if that would be
 
05:49:51.948 --> 05:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
helpful that would be wonderful thank
 
05:49:54.868 --> 05:49:54.878 align:start position:0%
you you're
 
05:49:57.510 --> 05:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
welcome anyone with any further
 
05:49:57.520 --> 05:50:00.030 align:start position:0%
welcome anyone with any further
questions

05:50:00.030 --> 05:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:50:03.750 --> 05:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative sorry representative
 
05:50:06.948 --> 05:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and and as a matter of
 
05:50:13.788 --> 05:50:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:18.548 --> 05:50:18.558 align:start position:0%
that if if 37 States ratify the
 
05:50:21.590 --> 05:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
compact it doesn't bind any of the
 
05:50:23.708 --> 05:50:23.718 align:start position:0%
states that have not ratified the
 
05:50:25.788 --> 05:50:25.798 align:start position:0%
contract is that
 
05:50:28.190 --> 05:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct it would just be
 
05:50:31.270 --> 05:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
the organization moving forward with the
 
05:50:35.708 --> 05:50:35.718 align:start position:0%
compact so it's and and is it not true
 
05:50:38.548 --> 05:50:38.558 align:start position:0%
that sometimes despite the fact that
 
05:50:41.708 --> 05:50:41.718 align:start position:0%
this is an interstate compact states
 
05:50:44.628 --> 05:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
have individual variations in their
 
05:50:46.868 --> 05:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
version even though it's sort of based
 
05:50:50.910 --> 05:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
on a cohesive hole so each state really
 
05:50:52.910 --> 05:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
does very much
 
05:50:56.670 --> 05:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
retain control over its own
 
05:50:59.468 --> 05:50:59.478 align:start position:0%
procedures yes absolutely
 
05:51:01.708 --> 05:51:01.718 align:start position:0%
thank you and then if may I have one on
 
05:51:06.030 --> 05:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
a different subject sir sure um at some
 
05:51:10.030 --> 05:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
point somebody mentioned that we were
 
05:51:13.190 --> 05:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
transitioning from vendor services to
 
05:51:15.990 --> 05:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
contracted services and I'm not sure I
 
05:51:19.510 --> 05:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
got those terms right it it had to do
 
05:51:22.230 --> 05:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
with services for I think
 
05:51:25.270 --> 05:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled persons and I
 
05:51:27.310 --> 05:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
just wanted to know what the difference
 
05:51:29.190 --> 05:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
was between
 
05:51:32.350 --> 05:51:32.360 align:start position:0%
vendor services and contracted Services
 
05:51:34.590 --> 05:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
because um I would have thought they
 
05:51:37.350 --> 05:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
were the same thing so if anybody could
 
05:51:39.270 --> 05:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
explain that to me I would be
 
05:51:41.708 --> 05:51:41.718 align:start position:0%
appreciative this is Rebecca Ross again
 
05:51:44.390 --> 05:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm happy to representative Weber So
 
05:51:49.310 --> 05:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
currently for um residential Child Care
 
05:51:53.110 --> 05:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
um we have licensed and certified
 
05:51:55.548 --> 05:51:55.558 align:start position:0%
providers and if a provider is licensed
 
05:51:59.548 --> 05:51:59.558 align:start position:0%
and certified um they can take
 
05:52:02.590 --> 05:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
placements we do individual contracts
 
05:52:04.190 --> 05:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
that go to governor and council with
 
05:52:07.948 --> 05:52:07.958 align:start position:0%
them we are moving toward that in order
 
05:52:11.070 --> 05:52:11.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to tailor those so instead of
 
05:52:12.910 --> 05:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
having minimum certification
 
05:52:14.910 --> 05:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
requirements and anyone in everyone that
 
05:52:17.830 --> 05:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
certifies can provide services um we're
 
05:52:20.948 --> 05:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
05:52:24.990 --> 05:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
um really redefining what services
 
05:52:26.788 --> 05:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
they're providing and we're doing that
 
05:52:28.910 --> 05:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
both in our residential services but
 
05:52:31.628 --> 05:52:31.638 align:start position:0%
also putting out a number of our
 
05:52:33.628 --> 05:52:33.638 align:start position:0%
community- Based Services for child
 
05:52:36.628 --> 05:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
protection through contract so that we
 
05:52:40.468 --> 05:52:40.478 align:start position:0%
can um better identify what we're
 
05:52:42.670 --> 05:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
purchasing and what will meet the needs
 
05:52:43.910 --> 05:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
of the children and families we're
 
05:52:47.468 --> 05:52:47.478 align:start position:0%
serving so the the vendor providers
 
05:52:49.270 --> 05:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
right now are licensed and certified but
 
05:52:50.990 --> 05:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
they do not have governor and Council
 
05:52:56.270 --> 05:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:59.708 --> 05:52:59.718 align:start position:0%
you I'm getting a check from Christina
 
05:53:04.430 --> 05:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
Dia regarding the info and she says the
 
05:53:04.440 --> 05:53:06.468 align:start position:0%
Dia regarding the info and she says the
AFA

05:53:06.468 --> 05:53:06.478 align:start position:0%
AFA
 
05:53:10.948 --> 05:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
AA who writes it is uh that information
 
05:53:14.030 --> 05:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
is in the guideline that she emailed us
 
05:53:17.230 --> 05:53:17.240 align:start position:0%
to help us walk through the
 
05:53:20.270 --> 05:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
bill any other
 
05:53:23.750 --> 05:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative G yes thank
 
05:53:26.190 --> 05:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman oh the last question
 
05:53:28.548 --> 05:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
that was answered could you clarify more
 
05:53:30.510 --> 05:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
for one thing we couldn't understand
 
05:53:32.190 --> 05:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
everything you said because your voice
 
05:53:34.628 --> 05:53:34.638 align:start position:0%
tailed off but the the still the
 
05:53:38.110 --> 05:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
difference between a contract and a a
 
05:53:40.270 --> 05:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
contracted service and a vendor is not
 
05:53:43.468 --> 05:53:43.478 align:start position:0%
clear to me do they address different
 
05:53:46.430 --> 05:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
categories of people do they address
 
05:53:49.390 --> 05:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
different um lengths of time that you
 
05:53:52.310 --> 05:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
care for these kids um is it like a
 
05:53:54.628 --> 05:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
residential you're comparing residential
 
05:53:54.638 --> 05:53:55.868 align:start position:0%
residential you're comparing residential
to

05:53:55.868 --> 05:53:55.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:53:58.670 --> 05:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
daycare yeah please please explain a
 
05:53:58.680 --> 05:53:59.868 align:start position:0%
daycare yeah please please explain a
little

05:53:59.868 --> 05:53:59.878 align:start position:0%
little
 
05:54:04.070 --> 05:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
more be happy to um no you can use
 
05:54:07.150 --> 05:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
either either model and throughout the
 
05:54:09.788 --> 05:54:09.798 align:start position:0%
department we have different services
 
05:54:12.070 --> 05:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
that are provided under different models
 
05:54:16.110 --> 05:54:16.120 align:start position:0%
oh for example Medicaid pays in
 
05:54:19.708 --> 05:54:19.718 align:start position:0%
different ways but for historically for
 
05:54:24.670 --> 05:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
dcyf our providers have been um just
 
05:54:26.750 --> 05:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
essentially enrolled as long as they're
 
05:54:31.110 --> 05:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
enrolled they can they can take um
 
05:54:34.830 --> 05:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
clients and we will pay them the rate
 
05:54:38.270 --> 05:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
and and that is for both community and
 
05:54:42.708 --> 05:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
residential services that we pay for for
 
05:54:46.910 --> 05:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
um children in DCF care and custody
 
05:54:50.270 --> 05:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
that's changing um to provide a better
 
05:54:53.708 --> 05:54:53.718 align:start position:0%
service array so that we can identify
 
05:54:56.910 --> 05:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
what types of services we want out there
 
05:54:58.948 --> 05:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
and ensure that there's a provider there
 
05:55:00.948 --> 05:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
to do it right now providers are under
 
05:55:00.958 --> 05:55:01.910 align:start position:0%
to do it right now providers are under
no

05:55:01.910 --> 05:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:55:05.468 --> 05:55:05.478 align:start position:0%
obligation to um provide a service they
 
05:55:09.468 --> 05:55:09.478 align:start position:0%
are eligible to take um clients but they
 
05:55:11.788 --> 05:55:11.798 align:start position:0%
don't have any obligation to by going in
 
05:55:15.670 --> 05:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
a contracted model we can require that
 
05:55:18.190 --> 05:55:18.200 align:start position:0%
they provide a certain service to a
 
05:55:21.270 --> 05:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
certain number of Youth in a certain
 
05:55:25.548 --> 05:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
area um to really better purchase what
 
05:55:28.590 --> 05:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
we're looking for instead of
 
05:55:31.390 --> 05:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
um only having available what
 
05:55:34.230 --> 05:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
providers are inclined to
 
05:55:42.468 --> 05:55:42.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:45.430 --> 05:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
you we see no further hands I think we
 
05:55:48.310 --> 05:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
have three choices before us with this
 
05:55:51.310 --> 05:55:51.320 align:start position:0%
bill one is to
 
05:55:54.990 --> 05:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
wait because somebody or somebody's may
 
05:55:58.110 --> 05:55:58.120 align:start position:0%
have an amendment or more coming so we
 
05:56:00.510 --> 05:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
should wait for those
 
05:56:03.430 --> 05:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
or nobody's got an amendment coming but
 
05:56:06.110 --> 05:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
we might want to sit on it for two weeks
 
05:56:09.628 --> 05:56:09.638 align:start position:0%
still up to testify I'm so I am sorry
 
05:56:13.750 --> 05:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:16.270 --> 05:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
correct but hold that
 
05:56:19.548 --> 05:56:19.558 align:start position:0%
FR and I I see that uh and thank you
 
05:56:21.548 --> 05:56:21.558 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh for pointing out
 
05:56:26.270 --> 05:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
that to me uh we have a Mr Andrew Shori
 
05:56:29.230 --> 05:56:29.240 align:start position:0%
from Center tufton B who wishes to
 
05:56:33.110 --> 05:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
testify in the hearing and Mr shagari if
 
05:56:34.708 --> 05:56:34.718 align:start position:0%
you could put your hand up and you'll be
 
05:56:37.590 --> 05:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
recognized to come into to the
 
05:56:40.070 --> 05:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
meting thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:56:43.030 --> 05:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh my concern first off I'm
 
05:56:45.788 --> 05:56:45.798 align:start position:0%
chief of police and Tuftonboro I've
 
05:56:47.868 --> 05:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
served in the past on the
 
05:56:51.430 --> 05:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis advisory Council uh
 
05:56:53.510 --> 05:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
and I have concerns about
 
05:56:56.270 --> 05:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
sections 12 through 14 I think it's kind
 
05:56:58.548 --> 05:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
of worded poorly uh
 
05:57:00.110 --> 05:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
I think the better way is to exempt
 
05:57:02.510 --> 05:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
those products and have a a
 
05:57:05.150 --> 05:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
particular uh what products that they're
 
05:57:06.788 --> 05:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
referring to maybe that's the way to
 
05:57:08.830 --> 05:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
look at it instead of giving a blanket
 
05:57:11.670 --> 05:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
exemption to a whole chapter of
 
05:57:14.350 --> 05:57:14.360 align:start position:0%
laws uh more particularly though I I
 
05:57:16.350 --> 05:57:16.360 align:start position:0%
came on to talk about the rest of the
 
05:57:18.590 --> 05:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis section here
 
05:57:20.628 --> 05:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
sections 14 through
 
05:57:20.638 --> 05:57:23.628 align:start position:0%
sections 14 through
32

05:57:23.628 --> 05:57:23.638 align:start position:0%
32
 
05:57:25.910 --> 05:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
um I
 
05:57:28.750 --> 05:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
guess I like I said I I've been familiar
 
05:57:30.548 --> 05:57:30.558 align:start position:0%
since the start I was on the therapeutic
 
05:57:30.558 --> 05:57:31.670 align:start position:0%
since the start I was on the therapeutic
advisory

05:57:31.670 --> 05:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
advisory
 
05:57:35.390 --> 05:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
Council um we were when this was program
 
05:57:36.990 --> 05:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
was put in place we promised a tightly
 
05:57:39.468 --> 05:57:39.478 align:start position:0%
regulated program that was for the
 
05:57:42.548 --> 05:57:42.558 align:start position:0%
seriously ill people and it passed under
 
05:57:47.788 --> 05:57:47.798 align:start position:0%
that guys if you will under that intent
 
05:57:49.830 --> 05:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh then there was a five-year report
 
05:57:51.868 --> 05:57:51.878 align:start position:0%
issued saying it was that should stay
 
05:57:54.110 --> 05:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
along those
 
05:57:57.948 --> 05:57:57.958 align:start position:0%
lines this these changes being proposed
 
05:58:00.750 --> 05:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
first I uh when my cult talked about
 
05:58:03.910 --> 05:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
this uh audit I looked at the audit the
 
05:58:05.590 --> 05:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
audit had to do with why licenses
 
05:58:07.510 --> 05:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
weren't being issued within the
 
05:58:10.510 --> 05:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
statutory period of 15 days it had
 
05:58:12.990 --> 05:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with many of these changes
 
05:58:15.390 --> 05:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
here and I will send a copy of the audit
 
05:58:18.110 --> 05:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
so you can all look at it um what it
 
05:58:19.670 --> 05:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
happens when this if these changes go
 
05:58:23.030 --> 05:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
into effect sections 14 through 32 we
 
05:58:25.310 --> 05:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
will no longer have a tight program we
 
05:58:28.070 --> 05:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
will have a very loose program give you
 
05:58:30.948 --> 05:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
some ideas one patients will no longer
 
05:58:33.670 --> 05:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
be linked to an ATC they could go
 
05:58:36.948 --> 05:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
anywhere to any of the atcs and buy it
 
05:58:38.548 --> 05:58:38.558 align:start position:0%
it' be impossible to track whether or
 
05:58:40.990 --> 05:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
not they bought more than two ounces at
 
05:58:43.430 --> 05:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
any of the atcs because right now if
 
05:58:45.990 --> 05:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
they're tied to one that one knows if
 
05:58:48.750 --> 05:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
they've come in more than more than uh
 
05:58:50.628 --> 05:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
once in 10 days or how much they bought
 
05:58:54.230 --> 05:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
within that 10 day period this this will
 
05:58:56.270 --> 05:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
exempt them from being able to track
 
05:58:58.390 --> 05:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
that I know it adds a penalty for doing
 
05:59:01.110 --> 05:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
that but there realistically it's
 
05:59:03.670 --> 05:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
unenforceable uh in other states you
 
05:59:05.990 --> 05:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
would call this uh in Colorado they
 
05:59:07.628 --> 05:59:07.638 align:start position:0%
called it looping when people would come
 
05:59:11.590 --> 05:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
back and back and and buy over and over
 
05:59:14.190 --> 05:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
again um and in this case you have the
 
05:59:16.270 --> 05:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
caregiver could buy along with the
 
05:59:17.468 --> 05:59:17.478 align:start position:0%
patient and there'd be no way of
 
05:59:18.670 --> 05:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
tracking it in other words somebody
 
05:59:20.990 --> 05:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
could go to the Chai Chester dispensary
 
05:59:22.990 --> 05:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
and buy their two ounces and the
 
05:59:25.510 --> 05:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
caregiver could be going over to the one
 
05:59:28.310 --> 05:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
and over buying two ounces and then
 
05:59:31.030 --> 05:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
you don't know how how that's going to
 
05:59:33.590 --> 05:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
be tracked it and if they think they're
 
05:59:35.990 --> 05:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to track it more that's going to
 
05:59:38.590 --> 05:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
be tougher to track than anything else
 
05:59:40.468 --> 05:59:40.478 align:start position:0%
this also will allow the atcs to grow
 
05:59:40.478 --> 05:59:41.270 align:start position:0%
this also will allow the atcs to grow
more

05:59:41.270 --> 05:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:59:43.110 --> 05:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
marijuana because right now they're
 
05:59:45.270 --> 05:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
allowed a certain number of plants and
 
05:59:47.468 --> 05:59:47.478 align:start position:0%
then a certain number based upon the the
 
05:59:48.910 --> 05:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
number of patients that are tied to
 
05:59:48.920 --> 05:59:50.150 align:start position:0%
number of patients that are tied to
their

05:59:50.150 --> 05:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:59:52.390 --> 05:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
ATC this says they can grow it for
 
05:59:54.990 --> 05:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
everybody who has a card well recently
 
05:59:57.190 --> 05:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
my CLE testified in another hearing they
 
06:00:00.468 --> 06:00:00.478 align:start position:0%
11 th000 cards so instead of having the
 
06:00:02.150 --> 06:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
two or 3,000 that might be ATT tied to
 
06:00:04.110 --> 06:00:04.120 align:start position:0%
one ATC they're now going to be able to
 
06:00:07.430 --> 06:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
grow plants for all 11,000 of any
 
06:00:09.788 --> 06:00:09.798 align:start position:0%
cards uh it's gonna I believe it's going
 
06:00:11.948 --> 06:00:11.958 align:start position:0%
to allow out of state patients to buy
 
06:00:14.270 --> 06:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire atc's there's no way
 
06:00:16.110 --> 06:00:16.120 align:start position:0%
to verify out ofate
 
06:00:19.070 --> 06:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
cards uh then also here's a big loophole
 
06:00:21.030 --> 06:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to come up it's caregivers
 
06:00:22.468 --> 06:00:22.478 align:start position:0%
are not going to have a limit on
 
06:00:25.628 --> 06:00:25.638 align:start position:0%
patients it's presently is five patients
 
06:00:28.270 --> 06:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
they can they can help five patients
 
06:00:30.430 --> 06:00:30.440 align:start position:0%
with no limit they can carry almost any
 
06:00:33.030 --> 06:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
amount of marijuana they want with them
 
06:00:34.948 --> 06:00:34.958 align:start position:0%
uh there's no way to verifi There's no
 
06:00:36.708 --> 06:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
practical way to verify that in the
 
06:00:38.430 --> 06:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
field if a police officer contacts
 
06:00:40.070 --> 06:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
somebody and they've got a bunch of
 
06:00:41.590 --> 06:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
marijuana on them there's no way to
 
06:00:44.310 --> 06:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
verify that in the field the one time I
 
06:00:46.390 --> 06:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
tried calling there I got it was a
 
06:00:49.510 --> 06:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
Friday about 10: in the morning and
 
06:00:52.430 --> 06:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
instead of being able to verify it I got
 
06:00:55.070 --> 06:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
a call several hours later but here's
 
06:00:56.670 --> 06:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
the other problem that happens when you
 
06:00:58.270 --> 06:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
have no limit on
 
06:01:00.430 --> 06:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
patients other states have had that and
 
06:01:03.030 --> 06:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
they've had problems with it Washington
 
06:01:05.350 --> 06:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
Colorado Maine
 
06:01:07.430 --> 06:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
Michigan that becomes a loophole that
 
06:01:07.440 --> 06:01:08.190 align:start position:0%
Michigan that becomes a loophole that
gets

06:01:08.190 --> 06:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
gets
 
06:01:10.430 --> 06:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
exploited in Maine they have what are
 
06:01:13.628 --> 06:01:13.638 align:start position:0%
called um caregiver
 
06:01:17.150 --> 06:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
storefronts so caregivers are able to
 
06:01:19.070 --> 06:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
have a storefront where they
 
06:01:22.390 --> 06:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
can hand out give out marijuana sell
 
06:01:24.430 --> 06:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
marijuana they can't sell it but they
 
06:01:25.990 --> 06:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
can exchange it for their cost of
 
06:01:28.390 --> 06:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
expenses if you will Maine has them look
 
06:01:30.030 --> 06:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
them up this they're called caregiver
 
06:01:31.670 --> 06:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
storefronts and they're not subject to
 
06:01:34.750 --> 06:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
any regulation relative to because they
 
06:01:36.548 --> 06:01:36.558 align:start position:0%
have home grow there too but there's no
 
06:01:40.310 --> 06:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
subject to regulation as far as uh uh
 
06:01:41.788 --> 06:01:41.798 align:start position:0%
and they're fighting that the the
 
06:01:43.230 --> 06:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
caregiver storefronts are fighting
 
06:01:46.150 --> 06:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
Main's attempts to add regulation to it
 
06:01:48.590 --> 06:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
Washington had these pop up Michigan had
 
06:01:51.590 --> 06:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
a bunch of these carger storefronts by
 
06:01:53.948 --> 06:01:53.958 align:start position:0%
not linking limiting the patients you'll
 
06:01:55.990 --> 06:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
see what's called what they call in some
 
06:01:57.868 --> 06:01:57.878 align:start position:0%
states they call them cooperatives
 
06:02:00.670 --> 06:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
they'll have delivery services caregiver
 
06:02:03.750 --> 06:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
storefronts I think uh I think it's it's
 
06:02:05.910 --> 06:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of unintended consequences here
 
06:02:07.190 --> 06:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot more work and
 
06:02:08.990 --> 06:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
discussion before anything like this
 
06:02:11.350 --> 06:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
passes and none of this I repeat again
 
06:02:13.150 --> 06:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
none of this was in that audit that
 
06:02:14.590 --> 06:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
audit had to do with them not meeting
 
06:02:17.750 --> 06:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
the statutory deadline for issuing cards
 
06:02:19.190 --> 06:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
within 15
 
06:02:22.468 --> 06:02:22.478 align:start position:0%
days you should be aware that why I
 
06:02:23.990 --> 06:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
brought it the home grow into this there
 
06:02:25.750 --> 06:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
is another bill that has gone through
 
06:02:26.830 --> 06:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if it went through your
 
06:02:28.150 --> 06:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
committee or not
 
06:02:31.670 --> 06:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
HB 350 which talked about caregivers
 
06:02:33.310 --> 06:02:33.320 align:start position:0%
having home grow and patients having hom
 
06:02:35.310 --> 06:02:35.320 align:start position:0%
grow and be able to collectively home
 
06:02:37.350 --> 06:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
grow you're GNA have you're gonna have
 
06:02:40.390 --> 06:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
some problems if this passes as written
 
06:02:42.390 --> 06:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
um and the other part of that that that
 
06:02:44.430 --> 06:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
employees of DHS program will be exempt
 
06:02:47.190 --> 06:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
from marijuana drug laws if this passes
 
06:02:48.788 --> 06:02:48.798 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement for them to have
 
06:02:51.830 --> 06:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
any proof that they're involved with a
 
06:02:53.990 --> 06:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
regulatory uh scheme while they're doing
 
06:02:55.468 --> 06:02:55.478 align:start position:0%
this this just says if they're involved
 
06:02:57.708 --> 06:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
regulatory which is an easy thing to
 
06:03:00.310 --> 06:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
anybody could claim that another problem
 
06:03:01.948 --> 06:03:01.958 align:start position:0%
with this bill eliminates the address
 
06:03:04.628 --> 06:03:04.638 align:start position:0%
for card holders why do we need an
 
06:03:06.230 --> 06:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
address for card holders because we do
 
06:03:08.590 --> 06:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
search warrants and and marijuana is
 
06:03:10.110 --> 06:03:10.120 align:start position:0%
still technically illegal unless you
 
06:03:12.070 --> 06:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
meet certain threshold
 
06:03:14.548 --> 06:03:14.558 align:start position:0%
requirements um like this program for
 
06:03:15.868 --> 06:03:15.878 align:start position:0%
example it's an exemption from our
 
06:03:18.868 --> 06:03:18.878 align:start position:0%
marijuana laws without an address
 
06:03:20.430 --> 06:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
somebody could claim any marijuana
 
06:03:21.590 --> 06:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere as theirs because I don't
 
06:03:22.868 --> 06:03:22.878 align:start position:0%
expect a patient to carry all their
 
06:03:25.310 --> 06:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
marijuana with them all the time so if
 
06:03:28.230 --> 06:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
we went to apartment A five five Main
 
06:03:31.430 --> 06:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
Street Apartment a uh and we found some
 
06:03:32.948 --> 06:03:32.958 align:start position:0%
marijuana in that house in the course of
 
06:03:32.958 --> 06:03:33.590 align:start position:0%
marijuana in that house in the course of
an

06:03:33.590 --> 06:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
an
 
06:03:35.628 --> 06:03:35.638 align:start position:0%
investigation any patient could claim
 
06:03:38.510 --> 06:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's theirs because there's no name
 
06:03:40.670 --> 06:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
attached to them as far as I know there
 
06:03:42.788 --> 06:03:42.798 align:start position:0%
there's very limited requirements for
 
06:03:44.868 --> 06:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
for any kind of labeling other than what
 
06:03:46.750 --> 06:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
the strain is at the dispensary they can
 
06:03:49.110 --> 06:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
change the packaging this it's really
 
06:03:51.030 --> 06:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
pretty open as to what they do and and
 
06:03:53.430 --> 06:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it shouldn't be that way
 
06:03:54.990 --> 06:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
don't don't mistake that I'm not
 
06:03:56.948 --> 06:03:56.958 align:start position:0%
advocating for a change in that what I'm
 
06:03:58.310 --> 06:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
saying is without an address for a
 
06:04:00.708 --> 06:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
patient we can't say that that stuff we
 
06:04:02.310 --> 06:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
found at a certain place actually
 
06:04:04.468 --> 06:04:04.478 align:start position:0%
belongs to them and so if it actually
 
06:04:05.788 --> 06:04:05.798 align:start position:0%
belonged to somebody else they could get
 
06:04:07.430 --> 06:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
their buddy as a card to claim it for
 
06:04:10.390 --> 06:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
him and and and get an exemption if you
 
06:04:12.670 --> 06:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
will from the laws I think there's a lot
 
06:04:14.150 --> 06:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
of loopholes in here I think it needs a
 
06:04:17.430 --> 06:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
lot of work and frankly I didn't see
 
06:04:20.390 --> 06:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
anything that had to do with the
 
06:04:22.628 --> 06:04:22.638 align:start position:0%
audit if they need more staff they need
 
06:04:25.628 --> 06:04:25.638 align:start position:0%
more staff but extending them out three
 
06:04:26.948 --> 06:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
years I don't know how that helps with
 
06:04:30.110 --> 06:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
the audit maybe that arguably might have
 
06:04:31.590 --> 06:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
something to do with the audit making it
 
06:04:34.070 --> 06:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
less that they have to do every year but
 
06:04:35.708 --> 06:04:35.718 align:start position:0%
it also talked about adding staff and
 
06:04:35.718 --> 06:04:37.310 align:start position:0%
it also talked about adding staff and
training

06:04:37.310 --> 06:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
training
 
06:04:42.110 --> 06:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:46.070 --> 06:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
clerk yes yes thank you very much um I
 
06:04:48.350 --> 06:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
had a question sir you had commented
 
06:04:50.830 --> 06:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
about uh kind of a blanket exemption
 
06:04:53.830 --> 06:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
with to Tobacco in sections 12 and 13
 
06:04:55.468 --> 06:04:55.478 align:start position:0%
and I have to confess when I first read
 
06:04:57.708 --> 06:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
it that's how it impressed me but I
 
06:04:59.350 --> 06:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
thought we had a fairly clear
 
06:05:02.390 --> 06:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
explanation with the phrase with respect
 
06:05:04.830 --> 06:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
to the therapeutic use of cannabis can
 
06:05:07.430 --> 06:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
you explain why when it's restricted to
 
06:05:09.190 --> 06:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
with the respect to the therapeutic use
 
06:05:11.390 --> 06:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
of cannabis that you think it is a
 
06:05:12.990 --> 06:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
blanket loophole that would allow them
 
06:05:15.110 --> 06:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
to buy tobacco at a
 
06:05:17.628 --> 06:05:17.638 align:start position:0%
store I wasn't saying that at all what I
 
06:05:20.750 --> 06:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
was saying was that if there's a certain
 
06:05:22.070 --> 06:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
what do you talked about was some of the
 
06:05:23.590 --> 06:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
things that they do maybe it's rolling
 
06:05:25.830 --> 06:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
papers he's talking about because that's
 
06:05:27.708 --> 06:05:27.718 align:start position:0%
covered under that statute
 
06:05:29.070 --> 06:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
well if that's the case why not just
 
06:05:30.830 --> 06:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
give them exemption to sell Rolling
 
06:05:32.750 --> 06:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
Papers rather than give them a whole
 
06:05:34.510 --> 06:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
exemption from the whole SE section of
 
06:05:36.390 --> 06:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
the law I I think that's a better way of
 
06:05:38.150 --> 06:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
doing it if there's some specific thing
 
06:05:39.910 --> 06:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
they need some paraphernalia or
 
06:05:42.468 --> 06:05:42.478 align:start position:0%
something like that I'm not T I didn't
 
06:05:44.430 --> 06:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
say I read I understand what Mike col
 
06:05:46.350 --> 06:05:46.360 align:start position:0%
said about that with therapeutic
 
06:05:48.270 --> 06:05:48.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis and I understand your point but
 
06:05:50.030 --> 06:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
I think what I was getting at was maybe
 
06:05:52.270 --> 06:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
it needs to be rewarded to about those
 
06:05:55.628 --> 06:05:55.638 align:start position:0%
particular programs in the atcs that or
 
06:05:56.788 --> 06:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
or the products that they're trying to
 
06:05:58.910 --> 06:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
sell that might put them in violation of
 
06:06:01.190 --> 06:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
that section name them rather than just
 
06:06:02.670 --> 06:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
give them a blanket exception to the
 
06:06:05.390 --> 06:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
whole law if you will you little more
 
06:06:07.270 --> 06:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
specific is what I was getting at I
 
06:06:09.390 --> 06:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
realized it does not allow them to buy
 
06:06:12.270 --> 06:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
under 21 to buy
 
06:06:12.280 --> 06:06:13.910 align:start position:0%
under 21 to buy
tobacco

06:06:13.910 --> 06:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
tobacco
 
06:06:16.910 --> 06:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
represent follow up yes well but you
 
06:06:18.750 --> 06:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
used the word blanket exemption again
 
06:06:21.468 --> 06:06:21.478 align:start position:0%
and I I think the concern is that we can
 
06:06:24.350 --> 06:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
see that if things change in the tobacco
 
06:06:26.110 --> 06:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
law then we have to come back with a
 
06:06:27.868 --> 06:06:27.878 align:start position:0%
statute that might be important to be
 
06:06:29.670 --> 06:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
able to exempt that particular thing
 
06:06:31.350 --> 06:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
like initially might be vaping and other
 
06:06:33.548 --> 06:06:33.558 align:start position:0%
time it might be uh rolling papers and
 
06:06:35.868 --> 06:06:35.878 align:start position:0%
we have to keep coming back uh with the
 
06:06:37.548 --> 06:06:37.558 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program to ask for
 
06:06:40.390 --> 06:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
the exemptions one by one if we exempt
 
06:06:42.070 --> 06:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
them with regard to the therapeutic
 
06:06:45.070 --> 06:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis program only would that not uh
 
06:06:47.868 --> 06:06:47.878 align:start position:0%
allow them just to simply be able to do
 
06:06:50.430 --> 06:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
what's necessary in their ATC but would
 
06:06:52.708 --> 06:06:52.718 align:start position:0%
not allow this the purchase of tobacco
 
06:06:55.788 --> 06:06:55.798 align:start position:0%
products in a store was why would that
 
06:06:57.910 --> 06:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
not work
 
06:06:59.590 --> 06:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
well I said blanket exception to little
 
06:07:01.750 --> 06:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
statute as it relates to their
 
06:07:03.830 --> 06:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
exemption to therapeutic it's kind of
 
06:07:05.628 --> 06:07:05.638 align:start position:0%
twisting my words around let me give you
 
06:07:07.468 --> 06:07:07.478 align:start position:0%
an example this this bill as written as
 
06:07:10.590 --> 06:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
I read it doesn't just apply to atc's
 
06:07:12.628 --> 06:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
they could go into a general store any
 
06:07:15.910 --> 06:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
store and buy Rolling Papers a patient
 
06:07:17.910 --> 06:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
because not just the ATC selling but it
 
06:07:19.868 --> 06:07:19.878 align:start position:0%
also talks about patients with cards
 
06:07:23.070 --> 06:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
being giving exemptions right I mean
 
06:07:25.230 --> 06:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
that's how I read it to if it's just the
 
06:07:27.070 --> 06:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
atcs that's one thing but it talks about
 
06:07:28.948 --> 06:07:28.958 align:start position:0%
patients getting Exempted too so they
 
06:07:30.670 --> 06:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
could go to a store and rolling papers
 
06:07:31.868 --> 06:07:31.878 align:start position:0%
is probably the big thing that comes to
 
06:07:33.548 --> 06:07:33.558 align:start position:0%
my mind because it's specifically stated
 
06:07:36.430 --> 06:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
in the statute so I I I think it needs
 
06:07:38.548 --> 06:07:38.558 align:start position:0%
work I think it needs work to accomplish
 
06:07:40.190 --> 06:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
the goal they said they wanted to
 
06:07:41.590 --> 06:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
accomplish with it that's that was my
 
06:07:43.628 --> 06:07:43.638 align:start position:0%
point I'm not saying it gives him a
 
06:07:45.230 --> 06:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
blank exception because it does have
 
06:07:47.788 --> 06:07:47.798 align:start position:0%
that those few words in there um about
 
06:07:51.110 --> 06:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis um but is there's
 
06:07:53.190 --> 06:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
another there's another part of that too
 
06:07:55.430 --> 06:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
and that's Gramma and I'm not a an
 
06:07:58.510 --> 06:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
English major by any of the word but uh
 
06:07:59.910 --> 06:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
it does
 
06:08:03.230 --> 06:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
say or alternative treatment centers
 
06:08:06.070 --> 06:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
under RSA 126 X7 with respect to the
 
06:08:07.910 --> 06:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use of
 
06:08:12.430 --> 06:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis the or is disjunctive and the
 
06:08:13.868 --> 06:08:13.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court has said
 
06:08:16.990 --> 06:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
they're separate they could live alone
 
06:08:19.190 --> 06:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
somebody could argue I'm not saying that
 
06:08:21.190 --> 06:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
it's true I know that's not the intent
 
06:08:23.230 --> 06:08:23.240 align:start position:0%
somebody could argue that individuals
 
06:08:25.070 --> 06:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
would not be required to follow it under
 
06:08:27.750 --> 06:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis use a cannabis
 
06:08:29.868 --> 06:08:29.878 align:start position:0%
act because that only applies to the
 
06:08:31.670 --> 06:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
atc's like I said I'm not an English
 
06:08:34.510 --> 06:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
major I'm not gonna I'm not a lawyer but
 
06:08:36.350 --> 06:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
I'm telling you that sometimes the or is
 
06:08:38.670 --> 06:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
disjunctive and it's not clear that that
 
06:08:40.628 --> 06:08:40.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily applies to both somebody
 
06:08:41.910 --> 06:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't make that argument I'm not
 
06:08:42.990 --> 06:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
making that argument but I think it
 
06:08:43.000 --> 06:08:44.270 align:start position:0%
making that argument but I think it
needs

06:08:44.270 --> 06:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
needs
 
06:08:46.070 --> 06:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
Clarity I'm just saying it should be
 
06:08:50.110 --> 06:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:54.110 --> 06:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
section follow up again follow up again
 
06:08:57.590 --> 06:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay would not the or mean that the
 
06:09:00.468 --> 06:09:00.478 align:start position:0%
individual purchasing for example
 
06:09:02.670 --> 06:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
rolling paper or a vaping pen would not
 
06:09:05.110 --> 06:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
be subject to prosecution but nor would
 
06:09:07.070 --> 06:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
the person who is providing it isn't
 
06:09:10.670 --> 06:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
that why the word or is there is to take
 
06:09:15.350 --> 06:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
away the risk for the individual and for
 
06:09:19.270 --> 06:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
the uh ATC who would be selling the
 
06:09:22.150 --> 06:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
product well it also applies to
 
06:09:25.270 --> 06:09:25.280 align:start position:0%
individuals with cards uh not just ATC
 
06:09:27.990 --> 06:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
so uh store CL with a card is also
 
06:09:30.350 --> 06:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
Exempted to some degree too it's it's
 
06:09:32.590 --> 06:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
poorly worded that that's my point as
 
06:09:33.990 --> 06:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
we're arguing back and forth how it
 
06:09:35.510 --> 06:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
could be interpreted I think that just
 
06:09:37.788 --> 06:09:37.798 align:start position:0%
shows it I think that reinforces my
 
06:09:39.670 --> 06:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
point it needs work it needs work it's
 
06:09:41.230 --> 06:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it's I'm not saying it's
 
06:09:43.510 --> 06:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
badly intended I'm not saying it should
 
06:09:45.070 --> 06:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
to not do it I'm just saying it needs
 
06:09:47.390 --> 06:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
work on the wording so it's clear that
 
06:09:48.750 --> 06:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
because it says individuals who have
 
06:09:51.750 --> 06:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
issued registry card um that also
 
06:09:54.390 --> 06:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
includes clerks and stores right I mean
 
06:09:58.390 --> 06:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
they they're issued cards
 
06:09:59.948 --> 06:09:59.958 align:start position:0%
they could have cards working in a store
 
06:10:01.868 --> 06:10:01.878 align:start position:0%
and they could decide to sell to
 
06:10:03.468 --> 06:10:03.478 align:start position:0%
somebody who they think is using for
 
06:10:05.830 --> 06:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis at a regular store
 
06:10:08.230 --> 06:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's not specific to within the confines
 
06:10:10.910 --> 06:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
of an ATC or if it's intended it needs
 
06:10:12.788 --> 06:10:12.798 align:start position:0%
to be reworked that my point the wording
 
06:10:15.788 --> 06:10:15.798 align:start position:0%
is kind of poorly phrased and and
 
06:10:17.708 --> 06:10:17.718 align:start position:0%
subject to multiple interpretations as a
 
06:10:20.788 --> 06:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
discussion we're having right now and It
 
06:10:22.190 --> 06:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
ultimately would have to be clarified by
 
06:10:23.868 --> 06:10:23.878 align:start position:0%
a court if somebody decided to push it
 
06:10:25.868 --> 06:10:25.878 align:start position:0%
that far I don't know anybody that would
 
06:10:28.230 --> 06:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
but I'm just saying that's I think it
 
06:10:29.750 --> 06:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
should be clear of the intent and what
 
06:10:31.628 --> 06:10:31.638 align:start position:0%
is meant to be I heard what he said but
 
06:10:33.390 --> 06:10:33.400 align:start position:0%
the writing doesn't necessarily give you
 
06:10:33.400 --> 06:10:36.110 align:start position:0%
the writing doesn't necessarily give you
that

06:10:36.110 --> 06:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:42.150 --> 06:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:44.548 --> 06:10:44.558 align:start position:0%
chief saying none thank you chief for
 
06:10:48.030 --> 06:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you for your time
 
06:10:49.948 --> 06:10:49.958 align:start position:0%
do we have anyone else who has not
 
06:10:51.948 --> 06:10:51.958 align:start position:0%
testified who wishes to
 
06:10:55.270 --> 06:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
testify what was his name the chief
 
06:10:58.190 --> 06:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
chief I don't have anybody on my list
 
06:11:00.270 --> 06:11:00.280 align:start position:0%
those of you who have your computers in
 
06:11:01.590 --> 06:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
front of
 
06:11:01.600 --> 06:11:03.670 align:start position:0%
front of
you

06:11:03.670 --> 06:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:11:06.628 --> 06:11:06.638 align:start position:0%
no okay now I'll go back to what I was
 
06:11:08.990 --> 06:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
starting to say a minute ago and thank
 
06:11:11.110 --> 06:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
you again for interrupting me because I
 
06:11:14.150 --> 06:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
missed the chief uh we could do one of
 
06:11:17.350 --> 06:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
three things so let me ask is there
 
06:11:23.510 --> 06:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
anyone here who is wanting to work on an
 
06:11:25.990 --> 06:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
amendment okay we have one person who is
 
06:11:27.708 --> 06:11:27.718 align:start position:0%
wanting to work work on an amendment in
 
06:11:30.110 --> 06:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
which case that ends that we will wait
 
06:11:33.310 --> 06:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
two weeks and with that I will close the
 
06:11:38.230 --> 06:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill 162 we had five
 
06:11:41.788 --> 06:11:41.798 align:start position:0%
sign up in support six
 
06:11:44.468 --> 06:11:44.478 align:start position:0%
opposed no we've got a little bit of
 
06:11:48.948 --> 06:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
time so Mr representative Shapiro has
 
06:11:50.708 --> 06:11:50.718 align:start position:0%
had his hand up for quite some time and
 
06:11:53.430 --> 06:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
I think it related to that last bill
 
06:11:55.830 --> 06:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
well I didn't see it and nobody else did
 
06:11:57.750 --> 06:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
and nobody else told me but that's
 
06:12:00.190 --> 06:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
irrelevance so representative
 
06:12:02.868 --> 06:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
Shapiro I just wanted to say that um I
 
06:12:04.708 --> 06:12:04.718 align:start position:0%
was going to request that we wait before
 
06:12:07.230 --> 06:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
we EXA that bill but I do not
 
06:12:09.590 --> 06:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily um know that I will have an
 
06:12:12.310 --> 06:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
amendment um I just felt like I didn't
 
06:12:14.990 --> 06:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
get a full answer to my question about
 
06:12:17.910 --> 06:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
the work requirement and I've emailed U
 
06:12:20.230 --> 06:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
Mr Williams to ask him who I can speak
 
06:12:22.788 --> 06:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
to to get a fuller answer so I I would
 
06:12:24.910 --> 06:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
request the wait but I'm not suggesting
 
06:12:26.990 --> 06:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
that I'm necessarily going to have an
 
06:12:29.948 --> 06:12:29.958 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you very much and our
 
06:12:32.548 --> 06:12:32.558 align:start position:0%
next meeting will be Monday May 17th and
 
06:12:35.190 --> 06:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
that gives us two weeks to do that
 
06:12:37.670 --> 06:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes we just need to sit and think
 
06:12:39.548 --> 06:12:39.558 align:start position:0%
on something for a
 
06:12:43.190 --> 06:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
while with that I would like to ex go to
 
06:12:46.750 --> 06:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
exact the two bills from last time uh
 
06:12:49.948 --> 06:12:49.958 align:start position:0%
Amendments have come to us and I think
 
06:12:52.750 --> 06:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
we've all had a chance to see them and
 
06:12:55.788 --> 06:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
with that I open the executive session
 
06:12:57.830 --> 06:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
on Bill
 
06:13:02.110 --> 06:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
120 and I call on representative to mer
 
06:13:07.830 --> 06:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:10.590 --> 06:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you sir um yes I would
 
06:13:12.948 --> 06:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
like to bring forward amendment number
 
06:13:18.310 --> 06:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
11 187 which I mailed to the committee
 
06:13:22.230 --> 06:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
last week I think on Monday or Tuesday
 
06:13:23.270 --> 06:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
in any
 
06:13:27.350 --> 06:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
case this sorry
 
06:13:30.270 --> 06:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
I so I would move uh the amendment uh
 
06:13:32.990 --> 06:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
1187 and I'd like to speak to it if
 
06:13:35.230 --> 06:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
that's available allowed representative
 
06:13:38.350 --> 06:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
Marsh seconds it and representative KK
 
06:13:41.590 --> 06:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
coner excuse
 
06:13:47.070 --> 06:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
me okay yeah okay uh just simply um you
 
06:13:49.990 --> 06:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
I got together with uh a handful of
 
06:13:53.548 --> 06:13:53.558 align:start position:0%
people um representative Marsh Merchant
 
06:13:56.468 --> 06:13:56.478 align:start position:0%
Weber and then we got together with also
 
06:13:59.910 --> 06:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
the Pas particularly the VA uh person
 
06:14:02.190 --> 06:14:02.200 align:start position:0%
Richard laflam so that we went back and
 
06:14:03.590 --> 06:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
forth came up with what we thought was a
 
06:14:06.788 --> 06:14:06.798 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine one um put it out and um
 
06:14:08.510 --> 06:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
Gary Merchant gets the Eagle Eye award
 
06:14:10.350 --> 06:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
for picking out one more error that was
 
06:14:12.868 --> 06:14:12.878 align:start position:0%
still in that we processed that again
 
06:14:15.270 --> 06:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
and then came up with this final
 
06:14:17.670 --> 06:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment if you look at it it really
 
06:14:19.310 --> 06:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
basically it just replaces the whole
 
06:14:21.590 --> 06:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
bill the whole section one um and the
 
06:14:23.868 --> 06:14:23.878 align:start position:0%
point is that we just tidied up things
 
06:14:25.750 --> 06:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
saying that this didn't have to do with
 
06:14:27.868 --> 06:14:27.878 align:start position:0%
where they were from but licensed by
 
06:14:28.990 --> 06:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
this is line
 
06:14:31.310 --> 06:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
789 licensed by another state or
 
06:14:33.110 --> 06:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
territory United States or another
 
06:14:34.830 --> 06:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
country but that has to do with the PA
 
06:14:37.310 --> 06:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
not the physician or uh who's the
 
06:14:39.468 --> 06:14:39.478 align:start position:0%
supervising physician and then going
 
06:14:41.990 --> 06:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
down to lines uh oh sorry we also tidied
 
06:14:43.948 --> 06:14:43.958 align:start position:0%
up the issue that it was offering
 
06:14:46.310 --> 06:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
Services that's line 11 offered through
 
06:14:49.830 --> 06:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
the VA so it didn't have to be at the VA
 
06:14:51.708 --> 06:14:51.718 align:start position:0%
because sometimes it was uh offered
 
06:14:55.830 --> 06:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
elsewhere again n lines 14 through 19 um
 
06:14:58.590 --> 06:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
this is about the Pas who are employed
 
06:15:01.310 --> 06:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
by the VA offering their services and
 
06:15:04.070 --> 06:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
requesting licensure can be supervised
 
06:15:05.788 --> 06:15:05.798 align:start position:0%
by a physician license in any state or
 
06:15:08.230 --> 06:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
territory United States uh providing
 
06:15:09.910 --> 06:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
that that supervising physician has a
 
06:15:11.628 --> 06:15:11.638 align:start position:0%
license and good standing in that state
 
06:15:13.990 --> 06:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
or territory but we got rid of that word
 
06:15:15.830 --> 06:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
of our other countries because we did
 
06:15:18.030 --> 06:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
not want uh Physicians from other
 
06:15:18.040 --> 06:15:19.030 align:start position:0%
not want uh Physicians from other
countries

06:15:19.030 --> 06:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
countries
 
06:15:22.708 --> 06:15:22.718 align:start position:0%
supervising and um that was basically it
 
06:15:25.510 --> 06:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
the listing was again just this is z 223
 
06:15:27.548 --> 06:15:27.558 align:start position:0%
and four uh the listing is autostate
 
06:15:29.310 --> 06:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
licensed Physicians who accepting that
 
06:15:31.110 --> 06:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility that that information
 
06:15:35.590 --> 06:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
will be given uh to op oplc so that was
 
06:15:38.430 --> 06:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
all it just tidied up those few little
 
06:15:40.190 --> 06:15:40.200 align:start position:0%
problems that we identified again I
 
06:15:42.990 --> 06:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
thank the whole committee for that kind
 
06:15:46.750 --> 06:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
of segue that we did into an uh ad hoc
 
06:15:49.150 --> 06:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
executive session after the hearing uh
 
06:15:50.750 --> 06:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
when we kind of word Smith at the first
 
06:15:52.628 --> 06:15:52.638 align:start position:0%
bit but we did go back and make some
 
06:15:55.110 --> 06:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
changes and this is the final product of
 
06:15:55.120 --> 06:15:57.030 align:start position:0%
changes and this is the final product of
it

06:15:57.030 --> 06:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:15:59.350 --> 06:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak representative
 
06:16:02.910 --> 06:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:05.350 --> 06:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
06:16:07.030 --> 06:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
you representative kerk I might have
 
06:16:08.628 --> 06:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
missed this when we had our original
 
06:16:11.590 --> 06:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
discussion about this but does the PA in
 
06:16:14.990 --> 06:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
question have to be um requesting lure
 
06:16:16.670 --> 06:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire or can they just
 
06:16:18.590 --> 06:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
practice in New Hampshire given that
 
06:16:20.670 --> 06:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
they work for the
 
06:16:23.430 --> 06:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
VA my my understanding is they can
 
06:16:25.070 --> 06:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
practice since they work for the VA but
 
06:16:27.110 --> 06:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to get the license Ure we
 
06:16:30.150 --> 06:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
require that they be supervised by a New
 
06:16:32.990 --> 06:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire licensed physician and this
 
06:16:34.830 --> 06:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
was just allowing that it didn't have to
 
06:16:36.868 --> 06:16:36.878 align:start position:0%
default to that because their supervis
 
06:16:39.628 --> 06:16:39.638 align:start position:0%
supervising physician on site may be
 
06:16:41.830 --> 06:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
licensed for example in Massachusetts
 
06:16:44.708 --> 06:16:44.718 align:start position:0%
but not here thank you that is my
 
06:16:46.990 --> 06:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
understanding representative
 
06:16:51.510 --> 06:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
gay thank you um do we have to that's a
 
06:16:54.468 --> 06:16:54.478 align:start position:0%
changeing wording uh if we're talking
 
06:16:57.510 --> 06:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
about onsite that is really a different
 
06:16:59.548 --> 06:16:59.558 align:start position:0%
situation from what apparently is going
 
06:17:04.628 --> 06:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
on because the um man I mean I I sent
 
06:17:09.110 --> 06:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
yall all late this this last night my
 
06:17:12.510 --> 06:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
wording which is almost exactly what you
 
06:17:15.430 --> 06:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
are talking about but I left out the
 
06:17:16.868 --> 06:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
word on
 
06:17:20.590 --> 06:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
site which may not be in this either
 
06:17:22.390 --> 06:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
because that was a real issue of
 
06:17:25.670 --> 06:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
discussion do you need a supervisor if
 
06:17:26.990 --> 06:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
it was was a New
 
06:17:30.510 --> 06:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um a New Hampshire licensed
 
06:17:32.310 --> 06:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
person PA
 
06:17:35.708 --> 06:17:35.718 align:start position:0%
working in a regular Hospital not in
 
06:17:40.310 --> 06:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
VA we would require the onsite I think
 
06:17:42.590 --> 06:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
but because this is the VA they run by
 
06:17:46.310 --> 06:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
their own rules we don't put on site in
 
06:17:48.948 --> 06:17:48.958 align:start position:0%
there because apparently they're
 
06:17:53.548 --> 06:17:53.558 align:start position:0%
allowing a doctor from Main to
 
06:17:56.430 --> 06:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
supervise what was the fraction
 
06:17:59.948 --> 06:17:59.958 align:start position:0%
one4 or three4 of all
 
06:18:03.390 --> 06:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
Vaas are being supervised by
 
06:18:09.230 --> 06:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
somebody in main or at least uh at least
 
06:18:12.390 --> 06:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
not with them not with the Pas not
 
06:18:15.788 --> 06:18:15.798 align:start position:0%
physically with them so I thought onsite
 
06:18:16.990 --> 06:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
was a very
 
06:18:20.390 --> 06:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
interesting concept to discuss and to
 
06:18:22.990 --> 06:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
see whether you keep it or not it
 
06:18:26.670 --> 06:18:26.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like if it's the VA use on
 
06:18:31.270 --> 06:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
site if it's a New Hampshire PA licens
 
06:18:33.628 --> 06:18:33.638 align:start position:0%
to work anywhere in New Hampshire you
 
06:18:39.628 --> 06:18:39.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:42.110 --> 06:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
onite that I'm confused on what you're
 
06:18:44.270 --> 06:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
trying to say I I'm sorry but I really
 
06:18:47.270 --> 06:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't follow what what you're saying
 
06:18:50.628 --> 06:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry you just said on site in your
 
06:18:54.750 --> 06:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
last statement the supervisory position
 
06:18:57.990 --> 06:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
you said something about it on site um
 
06:19:00.708 --> 06:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if I did I think I misspoke uh
 
06:19:05.190 --> 06:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
what it is um The Otter State licensed
 
06:19:08.510 --> 06:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
Physicians um the that are going to
 
06:19:10.708 --> 06:19:10.718 align:start position:0%
supervise they have to provide have to
 
06:19:12.468 --> 06:19:12.478 align:start position:0%
have a license in good standing in their
 
06:19:14.990 --> 06:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
respective state or territory I don't
 
06:19:17.150 --> 06:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
think I we have no language in here that
 
06:19:19.868 --> 06:19:19.878 align:start position:0%
says it has to be onsite supervision
 
06:19:21.468 --> 06:19:21.478 align:start position:0%
what we did talk about was that the it
 
06:19:24.510 --> 06:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
was the care um offered on site that was
 
06:19:26.150 --> 06:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
confusing in the first what we changed
 
06:19:28.468 --> 06:19:28.478 align:start position:0%
it to was offered to the VA we had
 
06:19:30.110 --> 06:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
actually Wordsmith that together in the
 
06:19:32.948 --> 06:19:32.958 align:start position:0%
group because of the fact that the care
 
06:19:36.150 --> 06:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
may be given um not at the VA but
 
06:19:38.350 --> 06:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
through the VA to Veterans and we wanted
 
06:19:40.590 --> 06:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
to be sure it was covered for care that
 
06:19:44.070 --> 06:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
was given let's say as Home Care by a pa
 
06:19:46.310 --> 06:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
um or in a nursing home or something
 
06:19:48.948 --> 06:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
like that I think that's is that what
 
06:19:48.958 --> 06:19:50.510 align:start position:0%
like that I think that's is that what
you're

06:19:50.510 --> 06:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
you're
 
06:19:53.270 --> 06:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
saying yes I just wanted to clarify when
 
06:19:55.830 --> 06:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
you brought the words up on site I I
 
06:19:57.548 --> 06:19:57.558 align:start position:0%
thought you were talking about the
 
06:20:00.830 --> 06:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
supervision so I no the no that was had
 
06:20:02.628 --> 06:20:02.638 align:start position:0%
to do with where this where the services
 
06:20:04.830 --> 06:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
are offered I'm sorry not on the site at
 
06:20:08.430 --> 06:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
the VA but um through their
 
06:20:11.788 --> 06:20:11.798 align:start position:0%
system got it now I'm sorry anyone else
 
06:20:14.590 --> 06:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
with anything to ask or share we're an
 
06:20:17.270 --> 06:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
exec session it does not have to be a
 
06:20:19.110 --> 06:20:19.120 align:start position:0%

06:25:34.070 --> 06:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
shy I asked representative Merchant did
 
06:25:38.948 --> 06:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
you second that yes I did thank you
 
06:25:41.510 --> 06:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
you yeah to speak to the motion the
 
06:25:43.390 --> 06:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
hardest part of this amendment was to
 
06:25:45.868 --> 06:25:45.878 align:start position:0%
put in contingency language so whether
 
06:25:49.830 --> 06:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
or not U House Bill 2 becomes law and
 
06:25:51.670 --> 06:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not this Bill gets passed
 
06:25:54.548 --> 06:25:54.558 align:start position:0%
prior to or after House Bill 2 the
 
06:25:56.070 --> 06:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate line language that we want
 
06:25:58.310 --> 06:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
to put into place actually get put into
 
06:26:00.628 --> 06:26:00.638 align:start position:0%
place um the second issue that this
 
06:26:02.390 --> 06:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
amendment addresses is the issue of
 
06:26:04.910 --> 06:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
retired practitioners who we all agree
 
06:26:08.990 --> 06:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
ought not to be able to uh uh access the
 
06:26:13.270 --> 06:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
control drug prescription the pdmp uh
 
06:26:15.868 --> 06:26:15.878 align:start position:0%
without a reason to be accessing it uh
 
06:26:17.670 --> 06:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
and representative Merchant to help us
 
06:26:19.310 --> 06:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
with a good bit of that language
 
06:26:20.910 --> 06:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
therefore his name is on this amendment
 
06:26:22.750 --> 06:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
as well so those those are the two
 
06:26:24.190 --> 06:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
issues that are addressed by this
 
06:26:32.150 --> 06:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:34.590 --> 06:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
discussion somebody just say very
 
06:26:38.430 --> 06:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:40.350 --> 06:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
is would you
 
06:26:43.430 --> 06:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
just in 25 words or
 
06:26:47.110 --> 06:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
less about the control drugs all right
 
06:26:49.628 --> 06:26:49.638 align:start position:0%
well the the issue that's being changed
 
06:26:52.468 --> 06:26:52.478 align:start position:0%
by the amendment is at present time
 
06:26:54.430 --> 06:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
certain retired individuals would have
 
06:26:56.708 --> 06:26:56.718 align:start position:0%
no reason access in this database
 
06:26:58.150 --> 06:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
currently still have access to the
 
06:27:00.750 --> 06:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
database and it makes it so that they
 
06:27:03.868 --> 06:27:03.878 align:start position:0%
would not have access to the
 
06:27:06.990 --> 06:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
database and if I may there's people who
 
06:27:08.830 --> 06:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
retire but there also people who are
 
06:27:11.030 --> 06:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
working clinical people who work in
 
06:27:12.670 --> 06:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
administrative positions that no longer
 
06:27:14.350 --> 06:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
work clinically but have a clinical
 
06:27:17.230 --> 06:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
license so therefore would apply to them
 
06:27:18.788 --> 06:27:18.798 align:start position:0%
as well so anyone who doesn't have a
 
06:27:20.948 --> 06:27:20.958 align:start position:0%
reason to be into the program therefore
 
06:27:24.110 --> 06:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:24.120 --> 06:27:25.830 align:start position:0%
 
program

06:27:25.830 --> 06:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:27:30.110 --> 06:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
any further discussion questions
 
06:27:33.070 --> 06:27:33.080 align:start position:0%

conditions are except for the ones that
 
06:27:59.548 --> 06:27:59.558 align:start position:0%
are changed in the amendment the
 
06:28:01.270 --> 06:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
definitions remain what they are under
 
06:28:03.830 --> 06:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
current existing law and what what
 
06:28:06.910 --> 06:28:06.920 align:start position:0%
relationship do they have say if do they
 
06:28:08.310 --> 06:28:08.320 align:start position:0%

06:28:11.030 --> 06:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
irregular do they are they mandated
 
06:28:13.390 --> 06:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
someplace else to communicate with the

06:28:23.708 --> 06:28:23.718 align:start position:0%
where does it uh
 
06:28:26.708 --> 06:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
fall uh that I would have to look into
 
06:28:29.110 --> 06:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
