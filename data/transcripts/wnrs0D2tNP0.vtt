00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 align:start position:0%
place and uh it is questionable as to
 
00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
whether there's a cousin it on the
 
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
be all right I'm going to give this a
 
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:28.680 --> 00:05:51.270 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 align:start position:0%

to the costumes in our town the little
 
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.469 align:start position:0%
to the costumes in our town the little
kids

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:04.870 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
represent open a hearing
 
00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
on an amendment and this is a little bit
 
00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
Terror Incognito for many of us but when
 
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
an amendment is brought forward that is
 
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
deemed non- gerine it must have a
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
hearing this is the hearing on Amendment
 
00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 align:start position:0%
2351 on House Bill
 
00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:34.550 align:start position:0%
2351 on House Bill
185

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
185
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
now this the reason for having a hearing
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
is because it was posted in the calendar
 
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
and because it puts non-gain language
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
now into
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
play uh it will follow the rules of a
 
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
hearing in that the proponent the uh
 
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor will get a chance to say
 
00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
some things we will call on anyone who
 
00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:01.879 align:start position:0%
after you've heard what the sponsor says
 
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
still wishes to testify so the chair
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative ball to speak
 
00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
testify thank you chairman harison
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 185 has come before this
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
committee several times over the past
 
00:08:06.749 --> 00:08:06.759 align:start position:0%
several months with several different
 
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
amendments this particular amendment is
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
addressing two issues uh or two concerns
 
00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
that were brought before uh the
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
committee identified as two concerns um
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
one was the definition of fit parent and
 
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
the other one was adding in some
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
additional language to number two uh
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
section two number three representative
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
Molton and I worked on that language and
 
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
we came up with this amendment to
 
00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
address it however after um more
 
00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
reconsideration and getting some other
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
feedback uh we came to the conclusion
 
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
that this is still not ready for prime
 
00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
time people are still debating it and as
 
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
such um I would prefer not to bring
 
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
forward this amendment and I would
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
prefer to bring forward something that's
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
a little more
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
simple are both representative molon and
 
00:09:02.069 --> 00:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
I would like to do that thank you will
 
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
you take some questions from the
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
committee let me ask you one that the um
 
00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:17.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment you do wish to bring forth is
 
00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the original Bill yes
 
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
yes it is Sir and it simply
 
00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
changes two
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
phrases and could you speak to that
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
because it it will influence what we're
 
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
going to be discussing presently yes
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
chairman parison as a member of the
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
special committee to investigate Family
 
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
Court we looked into many different
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
areas of the family court and what we
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
found was at the Crux of the problem was
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
a differing of opinion of the phrasing
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
that is used in um the
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
original um law
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
which the number now escapes me I think
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
341 64 I can't remember it how about
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
4611 thank you I'm sorry one a and I
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
only know that because I'm reading it
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um so what we found is
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
that although we um and most people
 
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
thought there was an idea that when
 
00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
parenting decisions were made that it
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
was being done relatively close to a
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
5050 split we found that not all judges
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
were using that and that seemed to be um
 
00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
where we were recognizing that there was
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
some concerns um being brought forward
 
00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:37.639 align:start position:0%
and so that Amendment will now address
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
that particular concern with the hopes
 
00:10:43.069 --> 00:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
that that will alleviate a lot of
 
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
um concerns by our
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
constituents and to what degree was
 
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
their buyin across the spectrum of
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
uh I'm blanking the word people who care
 
00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:00.519 align:start position:0%
um well we did have uh judge king did
 
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
come and talk with us so he was one of
 
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
the people that gave us some advice on
 
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment um he gave that to the
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
special committee and um in speaking
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
with representative Molton and speaking
 
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
with our respective parties we had a
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
consensus in agreement that by doing
 
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
this in a smaller step and getting it
 
00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:22.519 align:start position:0%
across a Finish Line would be in the
 
00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
best interest of all involved so this
 
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
has buyin from both parties yes sir okay
 
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
chairman yes may I yes you may I just
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I'm looking at the
 
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
right document so this this is the
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
2378 we haven't presented that yet oh
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's the larger one right now we're only
 
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
considering um
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
2351 okay and uh then the question was
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
in the relative to
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
the uh uh Equalization of parenting time
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
is that spoken for in the new the uh
 
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
latest Amendment yes it is and where is
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
it where does that I'm passing the other
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that is probably going to be
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
brought forward I'm passing this around
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
now so the members of the committee can
 
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
take a look at
 
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
it I'm not I'm not doing
 
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to address it I
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
is okay thank
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
you uh we're not going to ask any
 
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
questions on the other Amendment but we
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
may look at it so
 
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
um we'll
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
Molton are going to be bringing forward
 
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
that's all we're doing we're not going
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%

complete understanding at this point
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
you're asking that we not move forward
 
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.710 align:start position:0%
you're asking that we not move forward
with

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
2351 which is this long one and that we
 
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
hold off until our exec and we talk
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
about the other one we're not voting
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
this is a hearing but she's asking that
 
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
when we get to the exec session

hopefully
 
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.160 align:start position:0%

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
brought forth you have that right you
 
00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:44.199 align:start position:0%

briefly

00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
for the uh record Mr chair uh Dana alra
 
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
you've heard me here many times four
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
wonderful children I wish I could see
 
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
them just for our
 
00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
audience uh if you could clarify we're
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
2351 which is not going to be brought
 
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
forth and what is the number that we're
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
hoping to
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
consider two three that will be
 
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
discussed during our executive session
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
right right right and during the
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
executive session is the committee able
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
to kind of mop up language from either
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
one of them if they think it's a good
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
idea or it's kind of up and down or one
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
or the other it is open for discussion
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you sir uh so in that
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
case I would just simply say that I
 
00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.030 align:start position:0%
case I would just simply say that I
think

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
23 excuse me 2351 is fine language I
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
would be happy to see it
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
passed with that said I understand that
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
there were probably people in the state
 
00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
who would oppose
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
this uh number of people earn a lot of
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
money you know
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
n and uh if we have to do what we have
 
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
to do to get something to get some kind
 
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
of shared parenting we have to do what
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
we have to do because I've gone seven
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
years and I'm a fit parent and while my
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
younger son is home sleeping off his
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
night at soup kitchen I haven't seen my
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
younger I've seen my younger three kids
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
probably 30 40 days total over the past
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
seven years M since my case started in
 
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
2016 so we've heard your testimony yeah
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
I uh just urg the committee to go
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
through the language of both of these
 
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
and do the best you can do thank you and
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%

because you helped prep Witnesses oh
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
because the credibility even if we agree
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
or disagree The credibility of how they
 
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
presented themselves was exactly what we
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
wanted and in part that was because of
 
00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:34.919 align:start position:0%
your prepping some of them so thank you
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%

choice good morning and thank you for
 
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:54.760 align:start position:0%

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
today yeah you got to be real cozy with
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
the mic
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the opportunity to speak
 
00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:03.559 align:start position:0%
today um as far as determining shared
 
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
custody um with RSA 461 A6 specifically
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
requiring the best interest of the child
 
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
to be taken into account when
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
determining parental rights and
 
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities how is that determined
 
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
whether or not a parent is using these
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
tactics and who is it that investigates
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
these claims I have years of documented
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
proof um which was something that judge
 
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:25.720 align:start position:0%
Hall couldn't be bothered to take a
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
glance at there should be some type of
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
formal process for the petitioner that
 
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:31.640 align:start position:0%
is constructed by a forensic
 
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
professional um who are well versed in
 
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
the signs of Parental alienation where
 
00:18:38.149 --> 00:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
in turn the said professional can make a
 
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
decision whether the the accusations
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
rise to the level of being heard by a
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
judge this process should allow evidence
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
attachments um this would eliminate a
 
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
judge's frustration in trying to
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
navigate through the hearsay and the he
 
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
said she said a judge would then have a
 
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
non-biased opinion of a qualified
 
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
professional as to any potential harm
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
being done to the children by one
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
parent's AC
 
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
um I have quite a few other points that
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
I think should be addressed um to start
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
from my own experiences some of these
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
issues are referencing a judge's bias as
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
to determining the the custody situation
 
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
according to New Hampshire state law the
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation protocol Section
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
3 C and D States ruling on motions or
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
making orders the evaluator shall not
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
rule on any motions nor make any orders
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
related to a case for which the
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
evaluator will be is or has been the
 
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
evaluator well judge poly Hall did
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
exactly this in my case my question here
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
is do we currently have a governing body
 
00:19:38.149 --> 00:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
appointed to oversee this and ensure
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
that the Judicial Code of Ethics is
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
being upheld and may I interrupt you to
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
answer that question this is the chair
 
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
speaking sorry over here sorry that's
 
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
okay um I also chair the special
 
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
committee on the uh Family Division of
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
circuit court and we have been having an
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
awful lot of conversation with
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
administrative judges on
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
evaluations and supervisions which is
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
being done but in the opinion of some of
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
us could be done more and when there is
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
a particular judge about whom there's a
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
numbers numbers of concerns you know
 
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
everybody has a bad day or every judge
 
00:20:18.909 --> 00:20:18.919 align:start position:0%
can have somebody who totally
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
misunderstands what's going on but when
 
00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:24.039 align:start position:0%
there's numbers of concerns of the same
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
sort going forward we believe the
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
Judiciary will take take considerably
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
more notice than they have been this is
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
where we've been moving in special court
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
so I I think there is some answer to
 
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
your concern um you're going to be happy
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
I think or at least somewhat yeah I mean
 
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
I watched the last um meeting on
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
September 12th I believe it was um where
 
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
they were stating the judges are making
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
decisions based on what they consider
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
facts which often times are not the case
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
it's simply details that were documented
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
incorrectly whether they're later
 
00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
corrected or not they remain f facts
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
that are strongly they strongly guide
 
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
future rulings and again in my case
 
00:21:05.149 --> 00:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
these facts were obtained during a
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation where again
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
protocol specifically states that no
 
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
other fact carried over to the hearing
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
and future
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
appearances um and presented to the
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
presiding judge aside from participants
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
date and whether or not they came to a
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
resolution the judge Hall was present
 
00:21:21.549 --> 00:21:21.559 align:start position:0%
and knew all the details that were later
 
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
understood to be fact and it determined
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
all of our future
 
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
hearings um I have a few other points of
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
contention um you you have this in
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
written testimony to us do you yes okay
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
good um since as I said we will not be
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
bringing this up this amendment up
 
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
nevertheless what you are offering I
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
think is very helpful both to this
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
committee and also to the special
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
committee so if we could have your
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
written testimony believe me we will
 
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
study it in this committee going forward
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
on this kind of issue and we'll
 
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
definitely be looking at it in the
 
00:21:57.269 --> 00:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
special committee so thank you for
 
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
detailing this but uh you do not need to
 
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
read all the rest of it um if you've
 
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
made a good impression on me I don't
 
00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:06.279 align:start position:0%
know about the rest of them but if you
 
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
could uh give to representative Bickford
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
your your copies um when when we're
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
questions was that a
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%

motion okay thank you so this bill um
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
initially working with the sponsor um
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
the intention was to um protect both um
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
parents and children going through
 
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
custody cases um by making sure that
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
judges are giving consideration towards
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
picking uh Mental Health Counselors who
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
are covered by the parents health
 
00:30:58.029 --> 00:30:58.039 align:start position:0%
insurance so we're not having um these
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
outof Network providers ordered and
 
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
parents having thousands of dollars in
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
bills that they can't afford um and then
 
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
she also was concerned about um judges
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
ordering certain um reunification
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
therapies that um don't act in the best
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
interest of children um so we needed to
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
get to a little bit of a a definition of
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
what what kind of services are we
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
worried about um and so we're worried
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
about Services um that as a condition
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
for participation um issue as a as a
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
matter of course no contact orders
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
transfer of custody threats Force um
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
coercion verbal or physical abuse or
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
isolation from the child's community and
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
so we're this bill is telling judges
 
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
that those are not appropriate Services
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
Arrangements any questions from the
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
committee to the amendment
 
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor you've got copies of it in front
 
00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:02.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
yep Mr chairman representative Bickford
 
00:32:10.509 --> 00:32:10.519 align:start position:0%
may I ask does this the shall not order
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
family reunification treatments
 
00:32:13.559 --> 00:32:16.789 align:start position:0%
family reunification treatments
programs

00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
so uh including but I'm trying to
 
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
understand it so is that out now or is
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
that on certain conditions like if the
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
insurance covers it or if the person
 
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
wants to pay for it themsel or so it
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
says the that part of the bill says that
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
um the the the court shall give due
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
consideration to selecting a counselor
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
who is recommended by the parties and is
 
00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
a participating provider it doesn't
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
prohibit the court from ordering a
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
provider who isn't accepted by the
 
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
insurance um but it asks them to look at
 
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
the insurance providers first because
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
there might be a situation where both
 
00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
parents agree we want this person to
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
provide the the treatment to our family
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
but they're not in our Network and the
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
judge can say yes to that um the idea is
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
to keep the judge from kind of going off
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
on their own and choosing somebody over
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
the objections of the parents who also
 
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
they can't afford um and then as far as
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
reunification therapies the judge can
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
order reunification therapies provided
 
00:33:20.909 --> 00:33:20.919 align:start position:0%
that they don't utilize these harmful
 
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
practices utilize what these harmful
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
practices that are listed in the bill so
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
it's did you spell that word what
 
00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
practices harmful harmful yes oh
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
harmful than I guess I guess I've been
 
00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
in New England too long now um so um so
 
00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:44.120 align:start position:0%
for example um there are reunification
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
therapies Who as a matter of course
 
00:33:49.629 --> 00:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
remove the child and place them in a
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
camp out of state um that's their
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
practice um there are um reun re
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
reunification therapies that that
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
utilize verbal and physical abuse or
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
isolating the child from their supports
 
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
as part of their practice with the idea
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
that this will help somehow breaking
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
down the child will build up their
 
00:34:10.589 --> 00:34:10.599 align:start position:0%
relationship with the other parent um
 
00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
and you know it's not in the best
 
00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:13.599 align:start position:0%
interest of child of children to have
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
their Spirits broken in an attempt to
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
repair a damaged relationship we ought
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
to be using some more evidence-based
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%

00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
and continued continuing contact with
 
00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
approximately equal parenting time in
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
two sections and why is that a good idea
 
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:07.640 align:start position:0%
461 what we have found in our
 
00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
investigation through the special uh
 
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
committee investigating family court is
 
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
that we have a very small number of
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
Judges who are not interpretate they do
 
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
not interpret frequent and continued
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
contact as as equal to 50/50 as possible
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
therefore parents and families that are
 
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
going into different cour houses are not
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
being treated equally because the law is
 
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:35.720 align:start position:0%
being read differently so we would like
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
to formalize and make sure that all
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
judges um are on equal footing and all
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
families get a fair um and Equitable
 
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
considerations in the cour houses any
 
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
molon thank you Mr chairman um I I've
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
been back and forth about this bill all
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
week and this is not a decision to take
 
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
lightly um that being
 
00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
said the language saying frequent and
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
continuing contact is very problematic
 
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
because it is not it is very vague it is
 
00:41:14.589 --> 00:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
not it doesn't say how it's going to
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
look for a particular family which I
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
understand is for that's for the judge's
 
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
discretion however that's when we get
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
into situations where
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
if one party interprets it that oh
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
frequent and continuing contact just
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
means phone calls then the other party
 
00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
can utilize that too and we do have
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
parties out there that will weaponize
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
this against the other person who will
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
interpret it according to how it's
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
written but then how they're taking
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
those words to mean and because our the
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
language doesn't have anything further
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
to direct the how the judges are
 
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to order it um then that's
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
where we run into a lot of problems and
 
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
we've we've heard multiple testimonies
 
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
of different problems that have been
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
that have gone through the courts so
 
00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
that and that includes my own um but I'm
 
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
not here to talk about my own situation
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
I'm also talking about like all the
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
testimonies that we've heard
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
so that being
 
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
said then there's then I yesterday I
 
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
heard testimony where this would
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
be problematic
 
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
for families that are going through
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
abuse and I recognize that domestic
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
violence has a lot of of of problems
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
legal problems that are that come along
 
00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.510 align:start position:0%
legal problems that are that come along
with

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
that however I told the person who was
 
00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
telling me this that the the purpose of
 
00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.990 align:start position:0%
telling me this that the the purpose of
this

00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
the the changes to the language is
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
to put boundaries up on the on what the
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
other person can utilize for harm so in
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
other words
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
if if one person is interpreting
 
00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
frequent and continuing contact as oh
 
00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
that they you know they can live with
 
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
this person but but then I can just do
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
phone calls the other person can use
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
that too because if there's not language
 
00:43:28.549 --> 00:43:28.559 align:start position:0%
saying that only one person can use it
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
then both parties can use that
 
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
language is everybody is that so that's
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
why you support the amendment you
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored so I just hang on but then
 
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:43.240 align:start position:0%
that's hang on Mr chairman H hang on Mr
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
chairman did you work on night last
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
night no I didn't this is me and my
 
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
natural I going to say you're very
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
coherent and that's that's always good
 
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
so my point is that if we if we can stop
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
the we ization of the language because
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
people are interpreting it willy-nilly
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
so to speak then then that is good and
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
that is protective in my opinion so I I
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
would love to hear what other people
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
would think
 
00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:13.839 align:start position:0%
about changing the language and we are
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
about to do just that the chair
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
recognizes the vice
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr chairman um yeah I
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
think approximately complicates it more
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh approximately Eco par morning time in
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
my mind has nothing to do with phone
 
00:44:32.349 --> 00:44:32.359 align:start position:0%
calls um at least continued contact
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
phone calls would be a contact so I can
 
00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:39.319 align:start position:0%
see judges being more perplexed on
 
00:44:41.549 --> 00:44:41.559 align:start position:0%
approximately um than the frequent and
 
00:44:41.559 --> 00:44:42.910 align:start position:0%
approximately um than the frequent and
continuing

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
continuing
 
00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.670 align:start position:0%
continuing
contact

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
contact
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
um I believe they're going to have their
 
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
own opinions on what approximate
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
is so if we're looking to
 
00:44:56.549 --> 00:44:56.559 align:start position:0%
narrow um you know the difference in
 
00:44:59.790 --> 00:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
that they're thinking um I don't I don't
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
believe this really does
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
it would the either sponsor care to
 
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
speak to that yes sir go
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
ahead I believe that the word
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
approximately is in there because we
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
cannot rip a baby in
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
half and that is by saying equal
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
parenting time that is what we are
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
attempting to do so we have to realize
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
that there are times when it way may not
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
not be exactly 5050 it might be
 
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
4951 for the simple reason once again
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get that weaponization
 
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
out because if a child let's say they
 
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
get to stay home from school one day
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
because it's a holiday now they have
 
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
three extra quotes parenting hours with
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
that parent and the other parent can
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
then turn around and say well you owe me
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
three hours or an hour and a half or
 
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to start dissecting this
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
down so small so if we say approximately
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
equal it in most Minds as is today that
 
00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
we're thinking 5050 that's what our goal
 
00:46:04.549 --> 00:46:04.559 align:start position:0%
is but we know we can never accomplish
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
Perfection and I think approximately
 
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
equal and it does say parenting time it
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
does not say contact it's parenting time
 
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that
 
00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
addresses that we're not talking just
 
00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.109 align:start position:0%
addresses that we're not talking just
phone

00:46:20.109 --> 00:46:20.119 align:start position:0%
phone
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
calls Mr chairman may I the hand in the
 
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.589 align:start position:0%
calls Mr chairman may I the hand in the
corner

00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
corner
 
00:46:28.589 --> 00:46:28.599 align:start position:0%
were you raising your hand or stretching
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
I was but I can well that's all right I
 
00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
can do this representative Raymond go
 
00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.230 align:start position:0%
can do this representative Raymond go
ahead

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
please okay thank you um thank you Mr
 
00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:36.870 align:start position:0%
please okay thank you um thank you Mr
chairman

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
so I I think that
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
um in modern times we all agree that um
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
kids do best when both parents are
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
actively involved in their lives and
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
they have a a healthy relationship with
 
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
both parents um I'm wondering how this
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
change um interacts with things where
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
there are cases of abuse or neglect but
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
then also um how it interacts with
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
families who um have significant um
 
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
physical distance between the parents or
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps the parents live in different
 
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
school districts um I'm thinking of like
 
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
my daughter's best friend uh her parents
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
are divorced and for a while it was
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
50/50 but now that they are entering
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
into high school like the 5050 is not
 
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
working for their family because of the
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
number of activities and stuff both
 
00:47:29.069 --> 00:47:29.079 align:start position:0%
loving wonderful parents um how does
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
does this give judges the flexibility to
 
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
be able to make determinations based on
 
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
individual um children's
 
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances did I does that make sense
 
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
representative ball you wish to address
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
that yes if I can address that I think
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
what what this does it's not that it
 
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
gives the judge it gives the parents the
 
00:47:50.829 --> 00:47:50.839 align:start position:0%
flexibility to create their own
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
parenting scheduling that works for them
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
um for their individual family this is
 
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
is not something where it says you have
 
00:47:59.549 --> 00:47:59.559 align:start position:0%
to do this it's just saying that the
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
judges are going to support it so it
 
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
can't be weaponized to keep a child from
 
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
a parent but if parents mutually agree
 
00:48:09.069 --> 00:48:09.079 align:start position:0%
that for their family unit it works best
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
to do it another way then that is the
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
way it is done it is the parents who
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
should be creating their parenting um
 
00:48:20.109 --> 00:48:20.119 align:start position:0%
plan I think I heard somebody request on
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
this side of the room did I no yes
 
00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
no yeah that was me yeah represent
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you for allowing me to speak
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
um I feel very um uncomfortable when
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes to this amendment because
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
that uh co-sponsor of this amendment
 
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
already said that you know uh this had a
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
little bit to do with her personal even
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
though that she said that she's not
 
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
going to speak about her personal but it
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
bothers me when someone involves her
 
00:49:04.349 --> 00:49:04.359 align:start position:0%
personal life when introduce something
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know we we here to uh work for the
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
community not for our personal
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
agenda would you wish to speak to the
 
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
Amendments and that's why I'm saying you
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
know I I would love to to say you know
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
that um parents you know should
 
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
to have the opportunity to be with the
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
kids and then in some cases parents you
 
00:49:34.829 --> 00:49:34.839 align:start position:0%
know they're not El or they should not
 
00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
be have
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
5050 because
 
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh people sometime get divorced because
 
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
of use relationship and and then
 
00:49:46.549 --> 00:49:46.559 align:start position:0%
sometimes parents should not or one one
 
00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
have the equal time when the other
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
bigon representative Greg thank you Mr
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
chairman we this is something that we've
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
um gone over a lot within the special uh
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
committee that we've been working on and
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things I do want to point out
 
00:50:16.589 --> 00:50:16.599 align:start position:0%
is that the court has been very clear
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
there are three judges that have not
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily been you know having this
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
presumption or whatever that they would
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
work with these particular judges to do
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
that I I think when we take something
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
like this and put it into law we
 
00:50:33.789 --> 00:50:33.799 align:start position:0%
have there's no easy way to say you know
 
00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
that divorce is never easy split it
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
sharing custody is never easy um
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
something has happened that makes it no
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
longer feasible to live together when we
 
00:50:44.109 --> 00:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
put something like this in law where we
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
say approximately equal parenting time
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
even though this is trying to kind of
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
soften those
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
edges it I believe it's going to create
 
00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
many more issues than the couple that it
 
00:50:59.710 --> 00:50:59.720 align:start position:0%
would solve um you know even from we had
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
somebody testify that you know trying to
 
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
say okay we know we say it's good
 
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
parents but there's approximately equal
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
time and a parent has to literally say
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
so I can't have my kid like 50 for you
 
00:51:14.109 --> 00:51:14.119 align:start position:0%
know half the time I can't so it
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
actually because of this so then you
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
know there's all these there's all these
 
00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
different issues with this so I think in
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
trying to solve a problem for a few and
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
and by the way there are a few then
 
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
those are valid concerns um where maybe
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been abuse there's just
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
been a misunderstanding by the court but
 
00:51:34.109 --> 00:51:34.119 align:start position:0%
by trying to solve a few things this
 
00:51:35.549 --> 00:51:35.559 align:start position:0%
particular language whether it be in
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
abuse cases whether it be in cases where
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
parents just have to work a lot more
 
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
than the other one we are complicating
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
an already complicated situation we
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
making it more complicated would lines
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
14 to6 mitigate that by saying if it's
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
not in the best interest of the child
 
00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:54.440 align:start position:0%
the court may make findings right uh
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
supporting the order I think that's a
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
way out of so that's one of those those
 
00:52:02.349 --> 00:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
um maybe an extra seat Bel in certain
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
areas the problem is specifically so you
 
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
know this isn't the case I mean there
 
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
are a lot of different reasons for each
 
00:52:10.589 --> 00:52:10.599 align:start position:0%
one of the things but if we're talking
 
00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
about um let's talk about abuse cases
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
because a lot of the ones that we're
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
hearing there are either allegations of
 
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
abuse or whatever else when something
 
00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
you have something like this in law that
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
says approximately equal parenting time
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
what that does to people who are in
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
abusive situations which it's a huge
 
00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
step to say I'm going to go from being
 
00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:31.960 align:start position:0%
married to this person where I'm in a
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
house I can kind of have an eye you know
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
on what's going on because even if
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
somebody doesn't realize they're an
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
abusive situation but they're in this
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
relationship they do know they're
 
00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
protecting their kids from certain
 
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
things so there are many cases in
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
abusive situations that to separate from
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
that parent is one thing but the Fear
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
Factor that comes into that is how much
 
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
much time will the child be with them
 
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
abusers will use this saying I'm going
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
to get that you know 50% of the time A
 
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
lot of times they do say I'm going to
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
take the kids away from you completely
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
um that's that's not going to happen
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
because we do have judges looking at
 
00:53:10.789 --> 00:53:10.799 align:start position:0%
this and they have the discretion right
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
now to make sure that they you know are
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
doing what's the best interest for the
 
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
child this something like this in law
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
will keep people in situations they
 
00:53:21.789 --> 00:53:21.799 align:start position:0%
should not be staying in and that's my
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
fear for the couple situations that we
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
could fix that are definitely innocent
 
00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
we are going to hurt a lot more people
 
00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:30.589 align:start position:0%
we are going to hurt a lot more people
representative

00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
ball I have not seen any data supporting
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh respectfully um I have not seen any
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
data supporting um that assertion I do
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
know a personal cases where people
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
actually stay in relationships because
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
they are afraid they were going to get
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
less than 50% of the time and could not
 
00:53:51.789 --> 00:53:51.799 align:start position:0%
leave their child um could not leave
 
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
this abusive situation because
 
00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:55.640 align:start position:0%
traditionally the court courts would
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
have ruled in favor of I hate to say it
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
but the mother um luckily our courts are
 
00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
now um recognizing that fathers and
 
00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
other um and
 
00:54:11.789 --> 00:54:11.799 align:start position:0%
mothers um equally love their children
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
and they should have equal access they
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
do not need to prove that they are fit
 
00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
parents they are fit parents unless they
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
are proved otherwise um and I believe
 
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
that having this it just says that you
 
00:54:26.349 --> 00:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
support it I believe that if parents
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
were told going into their divorce case
 
00:54:32.589 --> 00:54:32.599 align:start position:0%
that don't bother trying to get full
 
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
custody in a situation where there is no
 
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
abuse don't bother asking for that
 
00:54:39.069 --> 00:54:39.079 align:start position:0%
because the judge is going to support
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
5050 it's going to alleviate a lot of
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
tension a lot of anxiety a lot of fights
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
um and it allows the family to move
 
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:51.640 align:start position:0%
on obviously there is a carve out for
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
when we have child abuse and when we
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
have domestic violence that's all
 
00:54:58.789 --> 00:54:58.799 align:start position:0%
already in the law but in looking at the
 
00:55:02.349 --> 00:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
majority of cases which involved loving
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
families whose parents just no longer
 
00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
want to live together that we need to
 
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
allow that family to separate and allow
 
00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
equal access to both parents and for the
 
00:55:15.789 --> 00:55:15.799 align:start position:0%
best interest of the children thank you
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
representative Greg I would like to
 
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:19.480 align:start position:0%
point out that in the majority of the
 
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:21.640 align:start position:0%
cases where they do have loving parents
 
00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
they do not have um also the argument on
 
00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen with custody so
 
00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
in the majority of cases you're right
 
00:55:28.829 --> 00:55:28.839 align:start position:0%
where they have two loving parents they
 
00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
also do not have uh disagreements where
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
changed representative ball thank you
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
chairman person with all due respect we
 
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
just spoke of that there are three
 
00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:43.720 align:start position:0%
judges that do not start with 5050 so
 
00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
they at their own discretion decide
 
00:55:49.029 --> 00:55:49.039 align:start position:0%
where they're going to and divide up the
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
custody so therefore there is no quote
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
guarantee or anything going in and it's
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
not fair for families have a crapshoot
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
based on whether or not they get those
 
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
three judges a bigger concern is we are
 
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
now bringing in more judges to the
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
family court if those judges are then
 
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
mentored by the three judges who have a
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
different mindset we have now multiplied
 
00:56:11.029 --> 00:56:11.039 align:start position:0%
our problem and it's going to be
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
happening in every courtroom I still
 
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
believe that if Justice is blind then
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
every family under similar circumstances
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
should walk into every single courtroom
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and come out with the
 
00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
same results there shouldn't be a
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
crapshoot for parents and often times
 
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm hearing from my
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
constituents is oh my God I don't know
 
00:56:33.309 --> 00:56:33.319 align:start position:0%
which judge I'm going to get and they're
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
being um told by their attorneys or if
 
00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
they're working prosay it is it's all
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
going to matter what judge you happen to
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
get and that's just not fairness it's
 
00:56:42.799 --> 00:56:46.589 align:start position:0%
get and that's just not fairness it's
not

00:56:46.589 --> 00:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
Justice anyone else wish to speak on
 
00:56:53.069 --> 00:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
this representative Molton um I mean
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
representative ball thank you Mr
 
00:56:54.559 --> 00:56:55.470 align:start position:0%
representative ball thank you Mr
chairman

00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:56:57.549 --> 00:56:57.559 align:start position:0%
um representative ball hit a lot of the
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
points but we're just not seeing that
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
there's already a lot of complications
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
for if someone's going to leave an
 
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
abusive situation whether it's Financial
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
or you know the the fear uh aspect or
 
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
you know the violence there's all those
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
already exist I'm not necessarily
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
convinced that this is going to add to a
 
00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
problem that's already happening what we
 
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:24.200 align:start position:0%
actually need to solve that problem is
 
00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:25.750 align:start position:0%
actually need to solve that problem is
more

00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh law enforcement getting involved in
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
civil issues as opposed to you know just
 
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
telling them
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
to calm down or whatever you know they
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
end up saying to them
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
also um I'm not legislating based on my
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:50.029 --> 00:57:50.039 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
Bickford thank you Mr chair
 
00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
um well 20 years
 
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
ago there's a fellow named ol dunberger
 
00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
that came here and told us about Sweden
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
he came from Sweden he he says I can't
 
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
believe we're even talking about this he
 
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
says we automatically do equal do
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
equality in Sweden 20 years that was
 
00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
before 20 years ago they did it there
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
and and I filed a bill it was called HB
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
529 in 2005 very very similar to this
 
00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:25.839 align:start position:0%
started off with uh approximately or
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
equal time that should be the goal
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
poost and uh we went through five
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
amendments I think it was five anyway
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
and representative walls I don't know if
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
anybody knows representative walls
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
anymore she was near that long ago she I
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
think she chaired this committee for a
 
00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
while okay and uh so she came up with a
 
00:58:46.829 --> 00:58:46.839 align:start position:0%
bill that said comparable that was the
 
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:49.480 align:start position:0%
word she used we went and it went to the
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
Senate it passed 14 to zero from this
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
committee and when it went to the the
 
00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.039 align:start position:0%
Senate um they had changed it which
 
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
which disappointed me Senator Foster and
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
I were worked on it together but they
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
had ended up changing it to be may be
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
the court may do comparable and so we
 
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
ended up going to committee conference
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
and uh I was one of those that that
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
killed it but I know one of the Senators
 
00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
came to me and he says but at least
 
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
you're getting some language in there to
 
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:22.039 align:start position:0%
get started with and that's where we are
 
00:59:25.390 --> 00:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
again today 20 years later
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
I I'm willing to pay pass it just to get
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
started again
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
Greg oh
 
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:43.720 align:start position:0%
yes Vice chairman
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
long thank you Mr uh chairman um I get
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
coming quickly but to think that the
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
word approximately is not going to get
 
00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
us the same people coming with the same
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
issues it
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
is is not a is is not a fact I mean in
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
my opinion the crapshoot is still
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
approximately um so it it you know and
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
ammunition I'm traveling so I I can't
 
01:00:15.549 --> 01:00:15.559 align:start position:0%
have approximately equal parenting time
 
01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:20.839 align:start position:0%
and uh my ex tells my kid your dad has
 
01:00:23.029 --> 01:00:23.039 align:start position:0%
an expectation of approximately equal
 
01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
parenting time he didn't want it
 
01:00:27.069 --> 01:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
so talk about ammunition you know this
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
is building up more ammunition to think
 
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
that this is going to take care of the
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
problems we've been hearing um they in
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
my opinion just doesn't do so thank
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
you okay let's dra start drawing to a
 
01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
close here representative
 
01:00:47.029 --> 01:00:47.039 align:start position:0%
B in the states that have passed you're
 
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
welcome I'm sorry thank you chairman
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
Pearson in the states that have already
 
01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
passed uh equal parenting all the DB dat
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
has shown domestic violence has gone
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
down the animosities within the court
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
has gone down and the parents move on in
 
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
a better healthier fashion um with
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
regard to the word approximately I I as
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
I said there's no such thing is exact
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
and that was why as a committee we
 
01:01:16.829 --> 01:01:16.839 align:start position:0%
actually disgu we chose to use the word
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
approximately quite a while back um the
 
01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
fact that we're changing the contact to
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
Parenting Time I think is a big
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
difference it makes it very clear this
 
01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
is parenting time it's not FaceTime it
 
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
is parenting time
 
01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
much anybody who really hasn't brought
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
wants to bring up a point that really
 
01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
hasn't been brought up otherwise we're
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
just repeating
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
anyone what oh representative deimon
 
01:01:58.510 --> 01:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I think that one
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
of the things that hasn't been brought
 
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
up is the human aspect of a very
 
01:02:07.069 --> 01:02:07.079 align:start position:0%
difficult time in a family's
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
life approximate is the best we do
 
01:02:15.789 --> 01:02:15.799 align:start position:0%
unless you specifically split the child
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
or the
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
calendar exactly
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
5050 the rest according to Webster's
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
Dictionary is
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
approximate that's why the word is being
 
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
used The Human Condition is and the
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
human's lives are you cannot always
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
split 12
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
12 you cannot always split exact so
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
equal is the approximately the best we
 
01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:51.589 align:start position:0%
equal is the approximately the best we
can

01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
do and that's why approximately equal
 
01:02:55.119 --> 01:02:56.710 align:start position:0%
do and that's why approximately equal

the committee itl this representative

second all right
 
01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
discussion go
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
ahead based on the prime sponsor um you
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
know and kind of I think this had the
 
01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
best intentions whenever they first
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
filed it but as far as uh with what's
 
01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
going on federally with the laws and
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
stuff this is just not you know it's it
 
01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
could be making more problems but it's
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
not meeting what it was supposed to meet
 
01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
so I um fully support recommending that
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
we itl
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%

01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
471 an act relative to final disposition
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
hearings in divorce proceedings the
 
01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
chair makes the motion of
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
itl keep it down I'll I'll second and
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
the vice chair seconds it we can
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
understand why people want closure in a
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
divorce case it's emotional people want
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
to get on with their lives they would
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
like to put in their calendar the date
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
of the final disposition
 
01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
but to demand a final hearing be
 
01:10:59.709 --> 01:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
scheduled at the time temporary orders
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
in a divorce proceeding are issued is
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
not really realistic first of all every
 
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
case has its own issues and being early
 
01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
in a case we may not know how long the
 
01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
proceedings will take we hear from some
 
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
the demand that the court accept every
 
01:11:18.669 --> 01:11:18.679 align:start position:0%
piece of evidence
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
proferred yet we also hear from people
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
that some parties keep churning by
 
01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
demanding more than more than more which
 
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
is more likely to happen if the court
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
accepts e Peach of evidence offered how
 
01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
can you plan a terminal date if that
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
kicks in sometimes emergencies come up
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
in court an emergency hearing on
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
something that is extremely urgent and
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
by protocol everywhere that bumps
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
everything else down and that may mean
 
01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
your your final uh disposition date will
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
not be held even if everything else is
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
going smoothly also the bill to me seems
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
to be a bit contradictory to itself on
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
the one hand it demands the final
 
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
disposition hearing be
 
01:12:12.189 --> 01:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
scheduled but then it says it may be
 
01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
rescheduled for
 
01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
cause for Just Cause what are the just
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
causes doesn't Define them it could mean
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
any judge who has a cause believes that
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
judge to be just I don't think judges
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
believe themselves to be unjust so who
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
determines and what is the
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
determination and finally though the new
 
01:12:37.629 --> 01:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
budget is funded six more Circuit Court
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
judges it's still not enough to move
 
01:12:42.189 --> 01:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
things at a reasonable Pace we know that
 
01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of the testimony that we heard was
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
that those six new judges are going to
 
01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:48.990 align:start position:0%
that those six new judges are going to
help

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:12:52.629 --> 01:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
somewhat but the um study committee
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
outside stud study committee determined
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
there needed to be at least 20 new ones
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
we've made a good start we're hoping
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
more will be funded in the next budget
 
01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
but we have gotten
 
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
six and things are moving slowly because
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
there's too many things to
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
move as chairman of the special
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
committee on the Family Division of the
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court I've had several
 
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
conversations with the honorable David
 
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
King chief administrative judge of the
 
01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.470 align:start position:0%
King chief administrative judge of the
Circuit

01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
Circuit
 
01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
Court they agree
 
01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
that there are some judges who may have
 
01:13:29.629 --> 01:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
a weak spot here and
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
there judges will be helped along in
 
01:13:35.709 --> 01:13:35.719 align:start position:0%
such areas and if it seems a judge or
 
01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
two is in need of some continuing
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
education in the matter of better
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
scheduling I have sensed in my private
 
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
as well as public hearing contact uh
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
contact with the
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
judges um they will be looking more at
 
01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
judges who seem to be outliers in terms
 
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
of how they handle this or that so that
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
if there is a judge that really doesn't
 
01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
seem to quite know how to work a
 
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
schedule there will be some help
 
01:14:12.669 --> 01:14:12.679 align:start position:0%
provided continuing education so for all
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
of those reasons um while certainly
 
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
people would like to have a date um I am
 
01:14:22.629 --> 01:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
moving this bill in expedient to
 
01:14:22.639 --> 01:14:24.310 align:start position:0%
moving this bill in expedient to
legislate

01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:29.590 align:start position:0%
legislate
anyone

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.950 align:start position:0%
 
else

01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
right I know I hogged all the good
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
points yeah
 
01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:40.110 align:start position:0%
points yeah
sorry

01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
yes your back lit thank you Mr
 
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
chairman there you are just we oh the
 
01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
sunlight's behind me I thought it was a
 
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
an well what we had discussed earlier in
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
the year was that the if we want to just
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
move some of these cases along the
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
solution is not to put a end date right
 
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
away the solution is to hire more judges
 
01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.510 align:start position:0%
away the solution is to hire more judges
um

01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
because the the clog up is that the
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
cases take such a long time and we just
 
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
don't have enough judges to hear all the
 
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
cases in the time frame that they want
 
01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
to be heard so um
 
01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
that we're recognizing the same problem
 
01:15:38.629 --> 01:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
solutions seeing no further discussion
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
the action before us is um House Bill
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
471 the motion is inexpedient to
 
01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:49.960 align:start position:0%
legislate moved by the chair and
 
01:15:53.709 --> 01:15:53.719 align:start position:0%

objection to
 
01:16:33.629 --> 01:16:33.639 align:start position:0%
consent seeing none on to consent I
 
01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
think I've given you my committee report
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh I'll be happy to transcribe it onto
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
the form and sign it if you
 
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
471 there was a fiscal note to that Mr
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
you and there was another one yeah the
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
question the question arises sometimes
 
01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.510 align:start position:0%
question the question arises sometimes
if

01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
indeterminable VI means it cannot go on
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
consent so let me just say that if it
 
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
may go on consent that's where it's
 
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
going and if it may not go on consent it
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
isn't going on consent how's that
 
01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
huh and that way you can you can find
 
01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
and ah because it's itl
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
aha this is a continuing ed moment here
 
01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
what's that to be how does it feel to be
 
01:17:43.709 --> 01:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
perfect I don't know if I have a get
 
01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
there I'll let you know approximately
 
01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:48.229 align:start position:0%
there I'll let you know approximately
approxim

01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.350 align:start position:0%
 
equally

01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
equally
 
01:17:57.310 --> 01:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
okay where are we we've just did that
 
01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:00.760 align:start position:0%

01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
speak and then this is not the first
 
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
time and then you ignore and then you
 
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
ask who was raising the hand to speak
 
01:18:47.229 --> 01:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
when my hands was and then my microphone
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
was on like I say with all my respect I
 
01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
I I would love to have their son respect
 
01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:56.440 align:start position:0%

01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
able to ask a question or
 
01:19:02.629 --> 01:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
speak I'm going to go out on a limb and
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
wonder if when I don't see

um
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
01:22:23.709 --> 01:22:23.719 align:start position:0%
book called Rules of Evidence
 
01:22:23.719 --> 01:22:24.709 align:start position:0%
book called Rules of Evidence
from

01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it looks tattered and torn
 
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
torn and so on not because I bought it
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
in a used
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
bookstore but because I've read it four
 
01:22:36.669 --> 01:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
times with the
 
01:22:39.870 --> 01:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
footnotes with the subheadings with the
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
references to those law books over
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
there and uh the original Bill
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
40475 states that the right to present
 
01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
evidence shall not not be limited by
 
01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
anyone in charge or even limited by The
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
Evidence does the sponsor really mean
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
that a trial could go on and on and on
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
because the judge would not have the
 
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
power to stop someone from keeping on
 
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
admitting evidence
 
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
forever whereas The Rules of Evidence
 
01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:16.830 align:start position:0%
forever whereas The Rules of Evidence
give

01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
give
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
encouragement to the judge to say
 
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.070 align:start position:0%
encouragement to the judge to say
this

01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:23:25.629 --> 01:23:25.639 align:start position:0%
proferred rule this proferred piece of
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
evidence does not enhance the case it's
 
01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:29.830 align:start position:0%
evidence does not enhance the case it's
just

01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
repetitive it's being done to churn
 
01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:36.229 align:start position:0%
repetitive it's being done to churn
things

01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
also if there is no rules are no rules
 
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
in place guiding the
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
judges then something probative may be
 
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
out shown by something that is harmful
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
to the character in general of the
 
01:23:54.669 --> 01:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
person in
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
question well that was the original
 
01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
bill then uh there are people who wish
 
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
it to go into the opposite
 
01:24:06.510 --> 01:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
direction and if you've followed the
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
paper trail on Rules of Evidence that's
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
bills that have come before
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
us there needs to be some kind of
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
discretion on the part of the judge and
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
the Rules of Evidence in New Hampshire
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
are not mandatory in civil court if
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
you've been watching Law and Order for
 
01:24:29.550 --> 01:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
21 years like I
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
have uh you will realize that that's
 
01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:32.790 align:start position:0%
have uh you will realize that that's
criminal

01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
court if you've been watching Night
 
01:24:37.950 --> 01:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
Court as I have been it has got nothing
 
01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:45.310 --> 01:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
courts The Rules of Evidence are
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
guidance and judges are given some broad
 
01:24:52.590 --> 01:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
discretion the question keeps arising
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
how much
 
01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
discretion does this particular judge
 
01:24:59.470 --> 01:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
use and once again through the special
 
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
committee on the Family Division of the
 
01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.310 align:start position:0%
committee on the Family Division of the
Circuit

01:25:03.310 --> 01:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
Circuit
 
01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
Court I believe we have some good
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
interest on the part of the
 
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
administrative judges that if there's a
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
judge that seems to be way too
 
01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
permissive in letting things in and some
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
people object to that or a judge that's
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
way too restrictive to let
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
proferred evidence in and we have some
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
of that if somebody's really an outlier
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
this needs to come more before the
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
attention of the Justice Department's
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
Administration where again continuing
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
education bring us back into a good
 
01:25:44.669 --> 01:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
place and I think that one of the ways
 
01:25:48.189 --> 01:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
that that objective observers might see
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
where is a judge that is too far one way
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
or the other
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
is by the amendment that I'm suggesting
 
01:25:58.510 --> 01:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment simply replaces the bill
 
01:25:58.520 --> 01:25:59.310 align:start position:0%
the amendment simply replaces the bill
by

01:25:59.310 --> 01:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:26:03.109 --> 01:26:03.119 align:start position:0%
saying if the court admits evidence or
 
01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
testimony over the objection of one of
 
01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.109 align:start position:0%
testimony over the objection of one of
the

01:26:08.109 --> 01:26:08.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
parties or if the Cho the court chooses
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
not to admit evidence or testimony
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
offered by one of the parties the court
 
01:26:19.950 --> 01:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
shall note in the record the reason for
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
its decision in other words judge you
 
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
just can't wander around doing what you
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
feel like if you're going to either
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
accept or reject something and you're a
 
01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
good judge you'll have a good reason and
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't be afraid to note it and I
 
01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:37.400 align:start position:0%
think what this winds up doing is
 
01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
letting the judges continue to have the
 
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
discretion that you have to have in
 
01:26:41.679 --> 01:26:43.350 align:start position:0%
discretion that you have to have in
circuit

01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
circuit
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
court but
 
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
say if you go too far this way or that
 
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
way little continuing education time
 
01:26:55.229 --> 01:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't hurt so I think this amendment
 
01:26:58.270 --> 01:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
um accomplishes what many of the people
 
01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
testifying before us would like to do
 
01:27:04.149 --> 01:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
without putting undo restrictions on a
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Raymond thank
 
01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um if we pass this um
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment as it is if it becomes law
 
01:27:21.790 --> 01:27:21.800 align:start position:0%
will that open the door for people who
 
01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
feel that they were treated unfairly to
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
have an Avenue for appeal if they have
 
01:27:29.109 --> 01:27:29.119 align:start position:0%
something from the judge saying why they
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
didn't admit the evidence it will if
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
they object according to the proper way
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
to object when evidence or testimony is
 
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
proferred okay which is why again prosay
 
01:27:44.229 --> 01:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
which is 80% of family
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
court I'm willing to bet most of them
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
haven't read this right because there
 
01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
are rules and on when and how you make
 
01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
an objection and if you don't you don't
 
01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
have grounds for appeal on what you
 
01:27:59.629 --> 01:27:59.639 align:start position:0%
failed to object to in a timely manner
 
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
and if on another matter a point of law
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
or protocol procedure you do have
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
grounds for objection you cannot I mean
 
01:28:08.910 --> 01:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
for appeal you cannot bring in an
 
01:28:11.149 --> 01:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
objection you didn't make in the initial
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
case the initial trial okay so assuming
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
that that a person the the judge makes
 
01:28:19.629 --> 01:28:19.639 align:start position:0%
his decision the person says I
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
disagree with or I object to your
 
01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
decision the judge says well I'm writing
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
down why based on this new law why I'm
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
making it at that point the person would
 
01:28:34.109 --> 01:28:34.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:36.510 --> 01:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
appeal grounds for
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
appeal are based on grounds for a
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
complaint perhaps improper understanding
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
or improper ruling at law and there's
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
something about protocols too I mean
 
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
there's two reasons you can object and
 
01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
you have lots of lawyers in the family
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
what what are the two reasons you may
 
01:28:56.430 --> 01:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
object from Circuit Court represent it
 
01:28:58.189 --> 01:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't get passed on by Blood so I have
 
01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
no idea but I do know based on the
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard that this would
 
01:29:02.239 --> 01:29:03.030 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard that this would
be

01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:29:05.149 --> 01:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
something the one of the problems that
 
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
they were having with the appeal process
 
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
is that you know they have all this
 
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
evidence and there was nothing to say um
 
01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
and representative long might might be
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
able to help me along with this but
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
there was nothing for them to be able to
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
say like oh I had this because once you
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
don't have the evidence in it can't go
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
into an appeal but if part of it is the
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
judge saying I'm not going to allow this
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
and then he writes it down then that can
 
01:29:31.070 --> 01:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
be part of from what I understand but I
 
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
am not a lawyer
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
so you just have Bunches of them around
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
signal how many judges write how much
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
down because if there's a judge
 
01:29:53.229 --> 01:29:53.239 align:start position:0%
that people realize okay that was fair
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
um even though somebody objects and the
 
01:29:58.350 --> 01:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
judge writes it down
 
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
and an objective observer looks at it
 
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
and said yeah well that's right yeah the
 
01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
judge was right to do that the judge was
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
right to do that we fine but if we get a
 
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
situation where there's too many I don't
 
01:30:11.229 --> 01:30:11.239 align:start position:0%
think the judge was right to do that
 
01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
says a supervising lawyer then there's
 
01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
some continuing education that needs to
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
happen we're not opening the floodgates
 
01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:23.800 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a way to say you can
 
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
object to one way or the other you have
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
to give the reason if you object you
 
01:30:31.550 --> 01:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
have to give a reason not just it's
 
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
hurting my case not just I don't like it
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
but why would this piece of evidence be
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
inadmissible then you can argue
 
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
probative is lesser than attacking
 
01:30:46.270 --> 01:30:46.280 align:start position:0%
another party you could argue that the
 
01:30:49.229 --> 01:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
piece of evidence proferred is does not
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
enhance the case I mean there's numbers
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
of reasons
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
um and that's how this has to be based
 
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
on as those reasons and it has to be
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
noted representative Greg and I think
 
01:31:03.310 --> 01:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things um thank you uh
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson one of the things that
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
we talked about over and over that we
 
01:31:09.149 --> 01:31:09.159 align:start position:0%
heard about over and over in the special
 
01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
um committee which it's hard to always
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
remember what we talked about in there
 
01:31:14.189 --> 01:31:14.199 align:start position:0%
and what we talked about in here but um
 
01:31:17.629 --> 01:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
that we were hearing a lot is that there
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
was an overarching thing that people
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
weren't being heard that they felt like
 
01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
they especially our post Sal it against
 
01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
that they felt like they didn't so this
 
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
you know we do do not want to bog down
 
01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
the judges either but for whatever
 
01:31:32.189 --> 01:31:32.199 align:start position:0%
reason they're not allowing stuff in or
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
they are they're thinking it you know
 
01:31:35.229 --> 01:31:35.239 align:start position:0%
they have something so just to write
 
01:31:37.109 --> 01:31:37.119 align:start position:0%
down so that people have a true
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
understanding so they at least know they
 
01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
were heard and because I think a lot of
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
what we were hearing is that people just
 
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
feel like they weren't heard like their
 
01:31:47.709 --> 01:31:47.719 align:start position:0%
evidence was dismissed but the judge
 
01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
does have a reason so this is just
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
having them log kind of what they
 
01:31:53.709 --> 01:31:53.719 align:start position:0%
thought so that they have a reason to
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
try to um help those prosay litigants
 
01:31:59.149 --> 01:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
you know a little bit more to understand
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
the court system it's not our job
 
01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
certainly to or the judge's job to you
 
01:32:05.109 --> 01:32:05.119 align:start position:0%
know give them a full law degree but
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
certainly in that one area where they're
 
01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
already thinking it we can at least put
 
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
it in writing so they have it so I think
 
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
that was kind of part of the thought
 
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
process on that the issue of Rules of
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
Evidence was one of the four major
 
01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
topics in the special committee and I
 
01:32:24.189 --> 01:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
picked to be the committee subcommittee
 
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
of five looking at evidence the five of
 
01:32:29.229 --> 01:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
us who are on both committees so that
 
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
we've already done this at some length
 
01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.629 align:start position:0%
we've already done this at some length
um

01:32:33.629 --> 01:32:33.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:37.400 align:start position:0%
and we were also the study
 
01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
committee out of this committee to look
 
01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
at it so anything else anybody else on
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
499 and it is relative to the admission
 
01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
of certain
 
01:35:36.910 --> 01:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
evidence in Family
 
01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:39.790 align:start position:0%
evidence in Family
Court

01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
Court
 
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
proceedings and the
 
01:35:46.109 --> 01:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
chair moves let's see are there any
 
01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
amendments coming forth on this I
 
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
haven't been given any there were a few
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
that bounced around around a long time
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
ago but I don't know if anybody you know
 
01:35:58.669 --> 01:35:58.679 align:start position:0%
amendments can be printed and done out
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
of os but they don't have to be moved
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
and you know usually they let me know if
 
01:36:05.709 --> 01:36:05.719 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to move something and
 
01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
nobody did I want to give you one more
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
shot at it in case if it's ready to
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
go uh so I guess that's going to be
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
a so House Bill 499 the chair moved
 
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
moves ought to excuse me the chair moves
 
01:36:27.629 --> 01:36:27.639 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
legislate I'll second and representative
 
01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
long will second
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
it take a minute if you would to reread
 
01:36:37.679 --> 01:36:39.790 align:start position:0%
it take a minute if you would to reread
the

01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:41.950 align:start position:0%
the
original

01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.280 --> 01:37:20.189 align:start position:0%
 
somewhere

01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.199 --> 01:37:39.910 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.229 --> 01:37:41.239 align:start position:0%
all right I think you've had a shot at
 
01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
reading it uh this bill requires the
 
01:37:46.109 --> 01:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
court in the Family Division cases to
 
01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
admit any evidence or testimony in any
 
01:37:54.510 --> 01:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
form and do we mean
 
01:37:58.109 --> 01:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
that once again what about the probative
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
evidence that should not be admitted for
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
good cause what about evidence that is
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
simply churning the process so that the
 
01:38:06.189 --> 01:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
case goes out for two or three years
 
01:38:08.189 --> 01:38:08.199 align:start position:0%
because there's always another motion to
 
01:38:08.199 --> 01:38:13.189 align:start position:0%
because there's always another motion to
admit

01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
evidence trial court must use a
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
balancing test to make a determination
 
01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
and again if they lean one way or the
 
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
other I've been referencing some
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
continuing education to help you know
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
you get somebody who's a real estate
 
01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
lawyer I and has practiced real estate
 
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
law for 10 years gets nominated to be a
 
01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
judge and gets put in Family Court I
 
01:38:40.990 --> 01:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
think this committee probably knows at
 
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
least as much as that judge who's
 
01:38:45.790 --> 01:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
probably going to be a good judge but is
 
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
just starting at step
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
one so they need the continuing educ
 
01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:53.159 align:start position:0%
education and I'm very happy that
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
they're quite amenable to
 
01:38:58.910 --> 01:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
this the bill says that it is not the
 
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
judge that will make the determination
 
01:39:02.589 --> 01:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
but the
 
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
respondent in the original Bill section
 
01:39:08.669 --> 01:39:08.679 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2 it says the court shall
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
apply New Hampshire Rules of
 
01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
Evidence to enhance the predictable
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
orderly fair and reliable presentation
 
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
first of all that's kind of what we have
 
01:39:22.030 --> 01:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
now secondly we've moved from the
 
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
respondent making the determination to
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
the court now making the determination
 
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:28.360 align:start position:0%
and which is it the bill seems to
 
01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:29.750 align:start position:0%
and which is it the bill seems to
contradict

01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
contradict
 
01:39:34.430 --> 01:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
itself research and you know I I thank
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
God for Wednesday Adams and all the
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
great work she's done for us research
 
01:39:40.990 --> 01:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
has shown that there are a handful of
 
01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
states that demand all evidence offered
 
01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
be accepted and the Rules of Evidence
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
also include the various procedures in
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
this so so I did a little snooping in
 
01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
one of the states that
 
01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
allows what this bill would want and and
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
what I discovered is since most family
 
01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
court cases have one or both parties
 
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
going prosay that is to say representing
 
01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
themselves it requires those not trained
 
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
in the law or who have read this several
 
01:40:12.589 --> 01:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
times to understand what all the rules
 
01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
are one party seeks to admit a piece of
 
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
evidence and the other party thinks
 
01:40:18.830 --> 01:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
according to the Rules of Evidence this
 
01:40:20.470 --> 01:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't happen but the judge does it
 
01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:22.030 align:start position:0%
shouldn't happen but the judge does it
anyway

01:40:22.030 --> 01:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
the motion must be made immediately
 
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
challenging the ruling of the judge and
 
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
reasons must be articulated as to why
 
01:40:30.589 --> 01:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
the judge ER based on chapter law
 
01:40:32.270 --> 01:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruling case law and
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
procedures if a litigant goes home and
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
does research or talks to someone he
 
01:40:38.189 --> 01:40:38.199 align:start position:0%
understands what he or she should have
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
said it's too late it should have been
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
done at that time was that means you
 
01:40:45.709 --> 01:40:45.719 align:start position:0%
kind of have to know all of this stuff
 
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
so once
 
01:40:50.189 --> 01:40:50.199 align:start position:0%
again when we have a judge who seems to
 
01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
be leaning to far to one side or the
 
01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
other to favor men rather than woman or
 
01:40:55.709 --> 01:40:55.719 align:start position:0%
the reverse or whatever or seems to
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
exclude too much or seems to include too
 
01:41:00.669 --> 01:41:00.679 align:start position:0%
much or not too much it would be
 
01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
impossible to pass a law to say exactly
 
01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
how it must be done so therefore the
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
Judiciary amendable to the suggestion
 
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
that one or another judge seems to be
 
01:41:13.070 --> 01:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
going a little bit to one way or the
 
01:41:15.470 --> 01:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
other a retired judge sitting in a
 
01:41:17.709 --> 01:41:17.719 align:start position:0%
courtroom where there have been a little
 
01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
too many complaints made against a judge
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
or else what ing televised recordings of
 
01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
certain hearings the Judiciary will be
 
01:41:30.270 --> 01:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
willing to do some further training most
 
01:41:34.109 --> 01:41:34.119 align:start position:0%
of the um papers that different ones
 
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
sent us had some variation of we
 
01:41:41.470 --> 01:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
understand what he's trying to get but
 
01:41:44.669 --> 01:41:44.679 align:start position:0%
we really don't think this will be
 
01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
practical so again that's my my two
 
01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
cents worth on Rules of Evidence anybody
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
else want to weigh in or did I take all
 
01:41:56.430 --> 01:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
the good points in you oh all the points
 
01:41:58.589 --> 01:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
good points thank you well next time I'm
 
01:42:00.669 --> 01:42:00.679 align:start position:0%
gonna save some good points field okay
 
01:42:03.070 --> 01:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
I'll take it I was on a roof I'm sorry
 
01:42:05.189 --> 01:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
you're getting close to Perfection I am
 
01:42:07.470 --> 01:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
not getting close to Perfection maybe on
 
01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
rules of careful be very careful I'm
 
01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:14.030 align:start position:0%
rules of careful be very careful I'm
getting

01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:17.229 --> 01:42:17.239 align:start position:0%
close I do want to meet the judge we
 
01:42:18.669 --> 01:42:18.679 align:start position:0%
spoke about I
 
01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:27.629 --> 01:42:27.639 align:start position:0%

amendment
 
01:45:54.990 --> 01:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
yes um just to speak on this a little
 
01:45:56.510 --> 01:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
bit no you're got to make a motion yes
 
01:45:59.070 --> 01:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make a motion to first
 
01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:00.790 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make a motion to first
first

01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
to uh ought to pass that's a good thing
 
01:46:06.669 --> 01:46:06.679 align:start position:0%
good very good that's it and
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford second that okay
 
01:46:11.790 --> 01:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
go you sure you didn't work all last
 
01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
night no this is just me in my natural
 
01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
form okay um that's why she worked night
 
01:46:21.149 --> 01:46:21.159 align:start position:0%
shift I know right so this was B
 
01:46:24.189 --> 01:46:24.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative Bickford and I just he
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
educated me on just some language
 
01:46:28.270 --> 01:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
cleanup on this and honestly I don't
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
even remember I'd have to refresh my
 
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
memory as to where it was
 
01:46:36.030 --> 01:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
um but it it was literally just just
 
01:46:37.470 --> 01:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
cleaning up some
 
01:46:40.990 --> 01:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
words so that's all we were
 
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
doing Amendment cleans up words may I Mr
 
01:46:47.629 --> 01:46:47.639 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah may speak to it better
 
01:46:49.229 --> 01:46:49.239 align:start position:0%
because he was the one that language
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative big
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
I unfortunately I left my my uh copies
 
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
at home I guess I picked up the wrong
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
stuff but what it is the first section
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
was about extending uh
 
01:47:04.669 --> 01:47:04.679 align:start position:0%
aages uh a period of reage from one
 
01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
month to two months and the problem is
 
01:47:09.629 --> 01:47:09.639 align:start position:0%
federal law says it has to be one month
 
01:47:11.870 --> 01:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
and if we and if we don't do what the
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
feds tell us to do then they will uh
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
penalizes in 4D money which you see 21
 
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
million but and it may be only a portion
 
01:47:23.950 --> 01:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
of that but uh anyway we decided not to
 
01:47:26.750 --> 01:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
go down that road it just wasn't worth
 
01:47:29.229 --> 01:47:29.239 align:start position:0%
the fight right now uh so that's what's
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
removed and the other thing that's
 
01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
removed is the word divorce because they
 
01:47:34.750 --> 01:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
started off by calling it divorce
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
hearing so we're taking out that word
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's but we did like the idea that
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services would uh give
 
01:47:47.550 --> 01:47:47.560 align:start position:0%
a form to people explaining to them how
 
01:47:49.589 --> 01:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
the wage assignment works and that they
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
can get a w W from it there is a method
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:47:56.589 --> 01:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
that which I'm very much in favor
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
of if you recall the hearing
 
01:48:03.229 --> 01:48:03.239 align:start position:0%
representative Spain moved this bill to
 
01:48:06.430 --> 01:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
us because um there have been a few
 
01:48:09.589 --> 01:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
cases where a day
 
01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
late is a problem and how can we work
 
01:48:15.589 --> 01:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
around sincere good faith efforts
 
01:48:18.510 --> 01:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
without running a file of the law and I
 
01:48:22.669 --> 01:48:22.679 align:start position:0%
think his his bill with the amendment
 
01:48:25.629 --> 01:48:25.639 align:start position:0%
before us accomplishes what he wants I
 
01:48:30.109 --> 01:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
don't you don't no this just informative
 
01:48:32.229 --> 01:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
I he I remember he came here and said
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
well I didn't know anything about I
 
01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:35.719 align:start position:0%
never heard of anything about I could
 
01:48:38.589 --> 01:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
establish me me and Mom could establish
 
01:48:40.709 --> 01:48:40.719 align:start position:0%
an account a separate account and go
 
01:48:42.270 --> 01:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
through them rather than having to go
 
01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
through health andher services so that's
 
01:48:47.189 --> 01:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
what we're accomplishing with this that
 
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
that the knowledge would be out there uh
 
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
I think the one month may have helped
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
him a little bit in that
 
01:48:55.709 --> 01:48:55.719 align:start position:0%
respect I think so we we I think we all
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
got a little lost on the other part on
 
01:48:59.790 --> 01:48:59.800 align:start position:0%
the pport thing I tried to find out more
 
01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
information on it they did change it
 
01:49:05.629 --> 01:49:05.639 align:start position:0%
from $5,000 to $2500 not all that many
 
01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
years ago but I can't I I just don't
 
01:49:09.589 --> 01:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
know about the
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
passport representative
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
grman thank you chairman Pearson um I
 
01:49:18.070 --> 01:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
guess this question so the Department of
 
01:49:19.629 --> 01:49:19.639 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and the
 
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
division of child support do they
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
support have have you heard feedback
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
from them about creating this form and
 
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
whether they interesting they they never
 
01:49:31.229 --> 01:49:31.239 align:start position:0%
came I did call and leave messages uh
 
01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
with them and uh trying to think the
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
woman's name over there uh but Matt
 
01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
Hayes of course takes some of the calls
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
and ask him to come by or let me know or
 
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
anything any any issues but nobody
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:49.119 --> 01:49:51.149 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:49:51.149 --> 01:49:51.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:49:53.950 --> 01:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
next time there's any question with
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services relating to
 
01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
any member of this committee um talk to
 
01:50:02.109 --> 01:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the Health and Human
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
Services oversight committee and I will
 
01:50:06.510 --> 01:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
be very happy to call them on your
 
01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
behalf the chairman of the over
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
oh so yeah I mean they're they're
 
01:50:19.149 --> 01:50:19.159 align:start position:0%
underst staffed by about 250 people over
 
01:50:20.669 --> 01:50:20.679 align:start position:0%
there they tell us so
 
01:50:22.669 --> 01:50:22.679 align:start position:0%
if this serves to be a problem just just
 
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
let me know there I'm trying to the
 
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
woman's name over there that uh I'm
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
sorry I I escaped me but his boss and
 
01:50:32.430 --> 01:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
she's incredibly responsive to my calls
 
01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
such but still okay did I see a hand way
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
down in the corner representative
 
01:50:39.149 --> 01:50:39.159 align:start position:0%
Raymond you know we really do need to
 
01:50:41.430 --> 01:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
get you a styrofoam that's what I think
 
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
I need you know one of those fingers
 
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah all right put it on your
 
01:50:47.470 --> 01:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
Christmas list very professional looking
 
01:50:50.589 --> 01:50:50.599 align:start position:0%
I think um so this one I'm confused by
 
01:50:53.510 --> 01:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
this because my notes from the last time
 
01:50:57.390 --> 01:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
we heard this um showed that um Child
 
01:50:59.550 --> 01:50:59.560 align:start position:0%
Support Services did come it was two
 
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
individuals and their concern with this
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
bill was about who makes the form and
 
01:51:07.790 --> 01:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
they were saying that like my notes were
 
01:51:10.669 --> 01:51:10.679 align:start position:0%
child support can't make a a form for
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch so the judicial the
 
01:51:16.350 --> 01:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
court system has to make their own forms
 
01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
and so that was my my note from the last
 
01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:20.550 align:start position:0%
and so that was my my note from the last
time

01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm reluctant to pass
 
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
something having child support make a
 
01:51:30.189 --> 01:51:30.199 align:start position:0%
form for the judicial branch if that is
 
01:51:31.709 --> 01:51:31.719 align:start position:0%
not the
 
01:51:34.149 --> 01:51:34.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate um vehicle to do that
 
01:51:35.669 --> 01:51:35.679 align:start position:0%
although I'm in support of a form I
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
think a form would be helpful I just
 
01:51:38.910 --> 01:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
think that it's
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
usually the judge the uh court system
 
01:51:43.310 --> 01:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
that does that well you have child
 
01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
support referees today I believe and
 
01:51:48.589 --> 01:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
child support pretty much controls that
 
01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
so I uh that's interesting I that it
 
01:51:55.109 --> 01:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
would require court and I can't read my
 
01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
own chicken scratch about people's names
 
01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:02.149 align:start position:0%
 
apologize

01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:52:05.229 --> 01:52:05.239 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else we could always take
 
01:52:06.669 --> 01:52:06.679 align:start position:0%
out the
 
01:52:10.229 --> 01:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
um who makes the form just say I was
 
01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
questioned using the standard well the
 
01:52:14.069 --> 01:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
word standard even needed to be in there
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:21.709 align:start position:0%
 
quoted

01:52:21.709 --> 01:52:21.719 align:start position:0%
quoted
 
01:52:21.719 --> 01:52:27.390 align:start position:0%
quoted
further

01:52:27.390 --> 01:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.669 --> 01:52:30.679 align:start position:0%
discussion representative long uh thank
 
01:52:34.830 --> 01:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um so in essence I this
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
really isn't a form it's more of a
 
01:52:42.109 --> 01:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh piece of liter literature explaining
 
01:52:45.709 --> 01:52:45.719 align:start position:0%
what it is yeah so it's not really a
 
01:52:49.470 --> 01:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
form um but I because I I have the same
 
01:52:51.629 --> 01:52:51.639 align:start position:0%
notes has representative Raymond had
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
that uh Division of Child Support
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
Services Health and Human Services said
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
that the court system should be making
 
01:53:01.149 --> 01:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
forms but it's not really a form that
 
01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
you would fill out it's it's just
 
01:53:07.470 --> 01:53:07.480 align:start position:0%
a pamplet information pamphlet telling
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
you well we could certainly take that
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
out I think we have time enough to well
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
if you look at lines 14 156 that seems
 
01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
to Define what the form is I I don't
 
01:53:18.589 --> 01:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
have in front of me it's in the
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
amendment which should have even have
 
01:53:21.119 --> 01:53:24.510 align:start position:0%
amendment which should have even have
that

01:53:24.510 --> 01:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:32.589 --> 01:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
coming Mr CH Mr chairman I'm at the end
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
of the trail who's so it would have to
 
01:53:36.189 --> 01:53:36.199 align:start position:0%
be representative Molton thank you
 
01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
you're welcome um it would have to be a
 
01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
form that it that they fill out because
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
it says in on line 15 allowing for both
 
01:53:46.069 --> 01:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
parties to detail their preferred form
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
of payment all right that's
 
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
true so the question is whether DHHS
 
01:53:54.510 --> 01:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
makes the form is that your question
 
01:53:57.310 --> 01:53:57.320 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford no that was uh
 
01:53:59.550 --> 01:53:59.560 align:start position:0%
represent Raymond's question I or yeah
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
that is the question right now that is
 
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
the question um I I think it would be
 
01:54:04.990 --> 01:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
how Serv because they they're the ones
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
that sit down with a party and talk to
 
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
them about what it's going to be and if
 
01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
they don't like it then they go to then
 
01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
you go to court on it you're you're
 
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
under the context of court but
 
01:54:18.109 --> 01:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
you're that's my understanding they have
 
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
child sport referees that you go to
 
01:54:22.229 --> 01:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
before you go into court and this way
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
this would show
 
01:54:27.709 --> 01:54:27.719 align:start position:0%
up who wants to speak representative
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
Raymond Raymond thank you Mr chairman
 
01:54:32.430 --> 01:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
but the but the bill
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
says this form is for the hearing at the
 
01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
final hearing so like this the bill
 
01:54:40.830 --> 01:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't talk about what happens at child
 
01:54:42.669 --> 01:54:42.679 align:start position:0%
support before court happens right
 
01:54:44.830 --> 01:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
because that's child support this bill
 
01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
talks about um at the final hearing
 
01:54:49.709 --> 01:54:49.719 align:start position:0%
that's when this form will be thing
 
01:54:52.069 --> 01:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
thing so it's already been it's actually
 
01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
the word is supposed to be prior to they
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
they left that out uh final hearing oh
 
01:55:01.629 --> 01:55:01.639 align:start position:0%
okay you recall that that we
 
01:55:04.270 --> 01:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
said huh do you have a copy
 
01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
of when you're when you wrote it I
 
01:55:09.189 --> 01:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
didn't tell them to do that no I only
 
01:55:11.069 --> 01:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
did the things you saw me fill out the
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
email that I sent to OS yeah I thought
 
01:55:16.109 --> 01:55:16.119 align:start position:0%
we put in Prior does anybody have a copy
 
01:55:18.589 --> 01:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
of the original Bill handy it's on the
 
01:55:21.910 --> 01:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
website bu at the final in a way
 
01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
supposed to be before the final hearing
 
01:55:24.669 --> 01:55:24.679 align:start position:0%
or at
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
least could the original bill doesn't
 
01:55:30.270 --> 01:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
say that either so no that's something
 
01:55:33.430 --> 01:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
we uh we added I believe yeah the
 
01:55:37.709 --> 01:55:37.719 align:start position:0%
original bill on online on legis scan
 
01:55:39.669 --> 01:55:39.679 align:start position:0%
says at the final hearing as well at the
 
01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
final divorce hearing and you struck
 
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
divorce right but it still says at the
 
01:55:46.589 --> 01:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
final hearing I guess I'm just we we
 
01:55:49.069 --> 01:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
struck the word divorce because not all
 
01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
not all child support hearings have to
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
do with divorce no that's totally
 
01:55:54.189 --> 01:55:54.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate I agree completely and I
 
01:55:56.669 --> 01:55:56.679 align:start position:0%
agree a form should happen I'm just
 
01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
right and the original bill it does have
 
01:56:00.990 --> 01:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
at the end DHHS Division of Child
 
01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
Support Services shall develop a
 
01:56:05.550 --> 01:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
standard form to be presented at the
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
final strike out the word divorce
 
01:56:10.109 --> 01:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
hearing so the the the
 
01:56:14.069 --> 01:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
dhs's role in developing a
 
01:56:18.149 --> 01:56:18.159 align:start position:0%
form um is uh constant all the way
 
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
through this process whether it's
 
01:56:23.390 --> 01:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
question yeah they
 
01:56:29.830 --> 01:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
they it should have been before by the
 
01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:31.870 align:start position:0%
they it should have been before by the
final

01:56:31.870 --> 01:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
final
 
01:56:34.030 --> 01:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
hearing because that was his concern he
 
01:56:36.589 --> 01:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
says nobody ever told me anything
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
anywhere during my my uh was the sub
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
committee divorce I guess it was when we
 
01:56:47.950 --> 01:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
met Mr chairman yes yeah may I yes thank
 
01:56:51.310 --> 01:56:51.320 align:start position:0%
you I I'm Wonder wondering if um
 
01:56:53.069 --> 01:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
is the right vehicle for this form child
 
01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
support forms are filled out in
 
01:57:04.510 --> 01:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
court not at DHHS the final disposition
 
01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
from the court in so far as garnishment
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
of wages or private pay W um child
 
01:57:19.470 --> 01:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
support comes from the court to DHHS so
 
01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if this particular form in
 
01:57:26.069 --> 01:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
which we speak should be this verbiage
 
01:57:28.589 --> 01:57:28.599 align:start position:0%
should be added to the child support
 
01:57:28.599 --> 01:57:30.229 align:start position:0%
should be added to the child support
calculation

01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
01:57:35.629 --> 01:57:35.639 align:start position:0%
form or an addendum to as opposed to a
 
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
form that DHHS would have to develop
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
themselves so D Simone yes sorry the
 
01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
chair would like to suggest we uh put a
 
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
hold on this hearing and then then we do
 
01:57:52.270 --> 01:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
some research and call over to
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
dhs's Children's people thingy and see
 
01:57:58.270 --> 01:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
what they say about this and put a few
 
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
phone calls out and we'll come back to
 
01:58:04.990 --> 01:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
this so we're going to uh um I want to
 
01:58:08.350 --> 01:58:08.360 align:start position:0%
use the correct term not do this anymore
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
a recess a recess thank
 
01:58:13.550 --> 01:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
you all right so we're recessing
 
01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:16.189 align:start position:0%
you all right so we're recessing
618

01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:16.199 align:start position:0%
618
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
and I don't
 
01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's no we're just
 
01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
recessing we're not doing anything in
 
01:58:24.910 --> 01:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
terms of determination we're just
 
01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
putting it on the side so we can do some
 
01:58:29.669 --> 01:58:29.679 align:start position:0%
little bit of research here and would
 
01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:35.510 align:start position:0%
 
researcher

01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
researcher
 
01:58:37.709 --> 01:58:37.719 align:start position:0%
you would you
 
01:58:43.350 --> 01:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
call the relevant division within
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
things and ask them please the question
 
01:58:55.390 --> 01:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
that we have been discussing are they
 
01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
the appropriate party to um to do this
 
01:59:03.390 --> 01:59:03.400 align:start position:0%

problem

02:25:34.790 --> 02:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
I just spoke to one number that referred
 
02:25:38.429 --> 02:25:38.439 align:start position:0%
me to another number that referred me to
 
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
a third number that referred me to a
 
02:25:41.950 --> 02:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
fourth number that referred me to
 
02:25:44.269 --> 02:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
attorney Susan
 
02:25:47.309 --> 02:25:47.319 align:start position:0%
bristen who is attorney with the
 
02:25:49.190 --> 02:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
Division of Child Support
 
02:25:52.910 --> 02:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
Services yeah me
 
02:25:58.110 --> 02:25:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:01.550 --> 02:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
doing it's not that I don't trust you
 
02:26:03.150 --> 02:26:03.160 align:start position:0%
it's just you've been in this place long
 
02:26:04.950 --> 02:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
enough to get a direct
 
02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
line and our mutual answer from the
 
02:26:10.269 --> 02:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
attorney is she doesn't think that the
 
02:26:12.309 --> 02:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
department is the agency that will do
 
02:26:14.830 --> 02:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
this he thinks it's the courts as a wise
 
02:26:16.870 --> 02:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
man recently once said before all of
 
02:26:19.269 --> 02:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
this transpired
 
02:26:23.469 --> 02:26:23.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:27.630 --> 02:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
that I didn't hear well put your mic on
 
02:26:30.190 --> 02:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you
 
02:26:34.230 --> 02:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
huh what did the counselor tell
 
02:26:37.110 --> 02:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
you counselor told me that she thought
 
02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
it should be the court because not
 
02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
everybody comes before the child support
 
02:26:44.550 --> 02:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
officer or referee would you believe she
 
02:26:46.590 --> 02:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
just told me the same thing that's good
 
02:26:48.910 --> 02:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
I I love consistency well at least we're
 
02:26:50.790 --> 02:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
coming into consensus so what does it do
 
02:26:51.750 --> 02:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:26:54.309 --> 02:26:54.319 align:start position:0%
amendment she also said that on the
 
02:26:57.070 --> 02:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
unified child support
 
02:27:01.309 --> 02:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
uh form that number seven talks about
 
02:27:02.670 --> 02:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
wage assignment whether you wanted to
 
02:27:04.630 --> 02:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
wage assignment uh no not why you want
 
02:27:06.150 --> 02:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
to but there is a wage assignment then
 
02:27:08.030 --> 02:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
number eight says do you want to suspend
 
02:27:08.040 --> 02:27:09.269 align:start position:0%
number eight says do you want to suspend
wage

02:27:09.269 --> 02:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
wage
 
02:27:11.550 --> 02:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
assignment good as uh representative
 
02:27:13.110 --> 02:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
ball pointed out well maybe somebody
 
02:27:15.309 --> 02:27:15.319 align:start position:0%
thinks that's not to pay child support
 
02:27:17.590 --> 02:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
but um anyway that
 
02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
representative Spain came to us and said
 
02:27:22.429 --> 02:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
well I never knew about it I was unaware
 
02:27:24.389 --> 02:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
that's why he felt that something should
 
02:27:28.309 --> 02:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
be enumerated to explain um more about
 
02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
it anyway it would appear that
 
02:27:32.950 --> 02:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative Spain is not the close
 
02:27:35.389 --> 02:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
friend with attorney Susan that you and
 
02:27:39.389 --> 02:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
I are I I actually don't know Mr we know
 
02:27:41.349 --> 02:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
her more than representative Spain us
 
02:27:42.630 --> 02:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
probably yeah
 
02:27:46.429 --> 02:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
yeah so um committee here we are what
 
02:27:48.030 --> 02:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
let's just have an informal little
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
chitchat before we go forward as to what
 
02:27:52.750 --> 02:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
we might do going forward anybody want
 
02:27:53.790 --> 02:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
to pipe
 
02:27:56.990 --> 02:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
in representative Molton well it sounds
 
02:27:59.630 --> 02:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
like we should go to the office of
 
02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
legislative services and get this
 
02:28:04.830 --> 02:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
changed to what that to say that the
 
02:28:08.469 --> 02:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
court should develop the form and uh
 
02:28:10.910 --> 02:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
that they should put it in as an amendm
 
02:28:13.030 --> 02:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
to the child support calculation form
 
02:28:15.269 --> 02:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
because as as representative D Simone
 
02:28:18.830 --> 02:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
and I were mentioning the lawyers have
 
02:28:21.630 --> 02:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
access to the child support calculation
 
02:28:23.389 --> 02:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
form so if if we make this as an
 
02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
amendment to the child support AC uh
 
02:28:28.349 --> 02:28:28.359 align:start position:0%
calculation form then the lawyers would
 
02:28:31.550 --> 02:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
have access to it and then because there
 
02:28:33.790 --> 02:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
are some cases that get resolved outside
 
02:28:37.150 --> 02:28:37.160 align:start position:0%
of court so if that's the case with the
 
02:28:39.190 --> 02:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
lawyers then then they can have access
 
02:28:41.110 --> 02:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
form how does that sound to
 
02:28:47.870 --> 02:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
everybody because just that in writing
 
02:28:53.670 --> 02:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:55.870 --> 02:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
well we're going to break for lunch a
 
02:28:57.870 --> 02:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
little bit and would you like to trot
 
02:28:59.710 --> 02:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
over to OSS and see if they can crank
 
02:29:01.950 --> 02:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
out of 30 minute specials when we come
 
02:29:05.110 --> 02:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
back she there was another thing that
 
02:29:07.630 --> 02:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
she said that should be a uh it should
 
02:29:10.190 --> 02:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
be presented at the temporary not the
 
02:29:14.389 --> 02:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:19.389 --> 02:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:23.550 --> 02:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
um it is line 12 in your Amendment yeah
 
02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
change the word final to
 
02:29:28.309 --> 02:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
Temp yeah and we questioned about the
 
02:29:28.319 --> 02:29:30.830 align:start position:0%
Temp yeah and we questioned about the
word

02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:34.269 --> 02:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
form it is that was okay because they
 
02:29:36.190 --> 02:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
the parties have to fill out information
 
02:29:38.429 --> 02:29:38.439 align:start position:0%
we mentioned that before because they
 
02:29:42.269 --> 02:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
have to put in that what their preferred
 
02:29:45.349 --> 02:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
for form of payment is so the parties do
 
02:29:47.110 --> 02:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
have to impart information so therefore
 
02:29:49.389 --> 02:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
it is a
 
02:29:49.399 --> 02:29:51.110 align:start position:0%
it is a
form

02:29:51.110 --> 02:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
form
 
02:29:56.190 --> 02:29:56.200 align:start position:0%
she did caution me about looking at
 
02:29:58.670 --> 02:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
the uniform
 
02:30:02.309 --> 02:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
support order form and if that is
 
02:30:03.469 --> 02:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
sufficient enough but that's the one
 
02:30:08.950 --> 02:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:12.030 --> 02:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
suspend in other words it could be ented
 
02:30:15.510 --> 02:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
in that area if we had wanted it instead
 
02:30:19.110 --> 02:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:22.349 --> 02:30:22.359 align:start position:0%
for I would say maybe we should do it as
 
02:30:25.230 --> 02:30:25.240 align:start position:0%
an as a as an addendum because some of
 
02:30:27.190 --> 02:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:30:30.550 --> 02:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
just thank you some of it is just
 
02:30:32.070 --> 02:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
information that the other party is
 
02:30:34.269 --> 02:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
given but the only part is that they
 
02:30:36.590 --> 02:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
just have to put in what their preferred
 
02:30:39.469 --> 02:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
form of payment is so we should have it
 
02:30:40.950 --> 02:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
completely separate from the child
 
02:30:40.960 --> 02:30:42.990 align:start position:0%
completely separate from the child
support

02:30:42.990 --> 02:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:30:45.950 --> 02:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
calculation okay that's okay with me
 
02:30:48.230 --> 02:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to input and I've
 
02:30:50.349 --> 02:30:50.359 align:start position:0%
given you the
 
02:30:54.590 --> 02:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
attorney's private line number so um I
 
02:30:56.349 --> 02:30:56.359 align:start position:0%
wrote it out because I don't want it to
 
02:30:59.469 --> 02:30:59.479 align:start position:0%
be P made public and um so after we
 
02:31:00.790 --> 02:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
break for
 
02:31:04.469 --> 02:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
lunch um you can see what you can come
 
02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
up with and we'll look at it as the last
 
02:31:09.910 --> 02:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
item of business so there it is I want
 
02:31:12.990 --> 02:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
to do one more for just to maintain our
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
record of
 
02:31:15.359 --> 02:31:16.990 align:start position:0%
record of
speed

02:31:16.990 --> 02:31:17.000 align:start position:0%

open the hearing on Senate Bill 253
 
02:31:22.990 --> 02:31:23.000 align:start position:0%

checking if if there were you'd know it
 
02:31:40.590 --> 02:31:40.600 align:start position:0%

02:31:46.040 --> 02:31:47.550 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative patrino for a
motion

02:31:47.550 --> 02:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:31:50.389 --> 02:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I make a motion to
 
02:31:53.950 --> 02:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
itl Senate Bill 253 and I second it
 
02:31:57.469 --> 02:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion please yes upon uh
 
02:31:59.469 --> 02:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
looking carefully at this
 
02:32:03.110 --> 02:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
U proposal uh the issue really isn't a
 
02:32:05.510 --> 02:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
matter of parents having access to their
 
02:32:07.389 --> 02:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
minor child's medical records it really
 
02:32:10.710 --> 02:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
seems to be a matter of uh access to the
 
02:32:14.150 --> 02:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
patient portal after the age of uh 12 it
 
02:32:17.349 --> 02:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
really is an issue of uh the software
 
02:32:19.950 --> 02:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
which makes it impossible to isolate
 
02:32:22.389 --> 02:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
certain information in accordance with
 
02:32:25.230 --> 02:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
federal and state laws so really this is
 
02:32:27.349 --> 02:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
not a matter of legislation it can only
 
02:32:30.150 --> 02:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
be resolved um if and when uh the
 
02:32:33.710 --> 02:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
technology advances accordingly so uh
 
02:32:35.550 --> 02:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
other than that parents do have access
 
02:32:38.150 --> 02:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
to their minor child's medical records
 
02:32:39.950 --> 02:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
except with this difficulty concerning
 
02:32:43.950 --> 02:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
the patient portal so we recommend itl
 
02:32:46.469 --> 02:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
anyone else to speak to this uh
 
02:32:49.110 --> 02:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt who was the Prime
 
02:32:52.429 --> 02:32:52.439 align:start position:0%

02:32:55.349 --> 02:32:55.359 align:start position:0%

Human Services that's right how soon
 
02:33:01.790 --> 02:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
they forget uh HB 406 and they'll be
 
02:33:03.870 --> 02:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
taking a different kind of stab at it
 
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
but the prime sponsor when this came
 
02:33:10.950 --> 02:33:10.960 align:start position:0%

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:36.670 align:start position:0%
 
Raymond

02:46:36.670 --> 02:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:43.990 --> 02:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:44.000 --> 02:47:04.030 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:47:04.030 --> 02:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:12.670 align:start position:0%
 
ORS

02:47:12.670 --> 02:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:17.030 --> 02:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
ATT yeah we yeah yeah we we wouldn't put
 
02:47:19.790 --> 02:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
that in language I mean you know an
 
02:47:21.590 --> 02:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
attorney getting paid to represent
 
02:47:23.670 --> 02:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
somebody I would hope they'd want to go
 
02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:24.710 align:start position:0%
somebody I would hope they'd want to go
visit

02:47:24.710 --> 02:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
visit
 
02:47:27.510 --> 02:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
them um you know that that's an
 
02:47:30.269 --> 02:47:30.279 align:start position:0%
assumption I think that we we assume
 
02:47:32.790 --> 02:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
02:47:35.190 --> 02:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
that that a that an attorney
 
02:47:37.309 --> 02:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
representing a child would go to court
 
02:47:41.790 --> 02:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
and say I haven't visited the child um I
 
02:47:44.269 --> 02:47:44.279 align:start position:0%
I don't see that happen is there
 
02:47:46.870 --> 02:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
anything that would prohibit the judge
 
02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:49.030 align:start position:0%
anything that would prohibit the judge
from

02:47:49.030 --> 02:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:47:51.550 --> 02:47:51.560 align:start position:0%
um assigning a different attorney or
 
02:47:53.590 --> 02:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
reassigning attorney if it comes to
 
02:47:55.190 --> 02:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
light that the attorney for whatever
 
02:47:57.269 --> 02:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
reason hasn't been making those regular
 
02:47:59.950 --> 02:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
visits um I'm asking because I Come From
 
02:48:02.110 --> 02:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
New York where I worked in the family
 
02:48:03.910 --> 02:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
court system there and frequently
 
02:48:06.309 --> 02:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
attorneys became overburdened and we'd
 
02:48:08.389 --> 02:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
have attorneys that met with the child
 
02:48:10.630 --> 02:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
for five minutes before the court case
 
02:48:12.630 --> 02:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
um and it just it wasn't effective
 
02:48:15.550 --> 02:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
representation um and so I
 
02:48:19.469 --> 02:48:19.479 align:start position:0%
I I worry about um that circumstance
 
02:48:21.630 --> 02:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
happening here okay I mean I I could I
 
02:48:23.389 --> 02:48:23.399 align:start position:0%
could only see I could only see that
 
02:48:27.269 --> 02:48:27.279 align:start position:0%
happening if if if there's a uh
 
02:48:30.950 --> 02:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
um I mean if an attorney's appointed and
 
02:48:32.429 --> 02:48:32.439 align:start position:0%
they're not visiting a child so they
 
02:48:34.309 --> 02:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
don't have any idea of the expressed
 
02:48:36.469 --> 02:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
interest of the child I would think
 
02:48:38.030 --> 02:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
they'd want to step down and tell the
 
02:48:40.870 --> 02:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
judge I'd like to resign myself from
 
02:48:42.670 --> 02:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
this because I don't have the time to
 
02:48:45.230 --> 02:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
visit the child um and and then the
 
02:48:47.630 --> 02:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
judge would appoint somebody else uh but
 
02:48:49.670 --> 02:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
to say I still want to be the attorney
 
02:48:52.510 --> 02:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
although I'm not going to visit the
 
02:48:56.190 --> 02:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
child you know I don't see any attorney
 
02:48:59.110 --> 02:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:02.670 --> 02:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:06.429 --> 02:49:06.439 align:start position:0%
B thank you Vice chair um correct me if
 
02:49:08.309 --> 02:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong but I believe we had this
 
02:49:11.309 --> 02:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
discussion um and what it was said to us
 
02:49:13.349 --> 02:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
is if the if the attorneys know that
 
02:49:14.870 --> 02:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
there is work for them then the
 
02:49:16.790 --> 02:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
attorneys will be trained to do this
 
02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
work and they will be available so this
 
02:49:20.550 --> 02:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
would actually increase the number of
 
02:49:23.870 --> 02:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys willing to do this hard work
 
02:49:27.269 --> 02:49:27.279 align:start position:0%
right yeah we that's a very good point
 
02:49:29.510 --> 02:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
we're also told that there are attorneys
 
02:49:32.590 --> 02:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
that are interested in children uh
 
02:49:35.590 --> 02:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
representing children so it wouldn't be
 
02:49:38.190 --> 02:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
looking for people that that they're
 
02:49:43.710 --> 02:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:46.670 --> 02:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
interested anyone
 
02:49:52.190 --> 02:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:58.510 --> 02:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:01.830 --> 02:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
idea uh let let let me ask this question
 
02:50:05.429 --> 02:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
I I can do that um if this is going to
 
02:50:09.550 --> 02:50:09.560 align:start position:0%

thingy

02:51:13.550 --> 02:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:13.560 --> 02:51:24.950 align:start position:0%

so I'll just be loud oh there it goes
 
02:51:28.750 --> 02:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
all right so anyways at The Advisory
 
02:51:29.950 --> 02:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
Board they were saying it would have
 
02:51:33.429 --> 02:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
been helpful to some of our kids who are
 
02:51:35.030 --> 02:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
appoint who are placed out of state to
 
02:51:37.229 --> 02:51:37.239 align:start position:0%
have an attorney to represent them um
 
02:51:39.309 --> 02:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
and I won't I won't go into details CU
 
02:51:41.910 --> 02:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
there were things on the news um but
 
02:51:43.990 --> 02:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
that seemed to be something that um The
 
02:51:47.349 --> 02:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:49.630 --> 02:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
recommending representative
 
02:51:52.429 --> 02:51:52.439 align:start position:0%
Nelson um regard uh thank you Mr
 
02:51:52.439 --> 02:51:54.150 align:start position:0%
Nelson um regard uh thank you Mr
chairman

02:51:54.150 --> 02:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:51:58.510 --> 02:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
um is it okay for me to say that there
 
02:52:02.030 --> 02:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
might be something down the line that
 
02:52:07.630 --> 02:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
would address representative Raymond's
 
02:52:12.349 --> 02:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:15.269 --> 02:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
yeah um I think think there might be
 
02:52:18.269 --> 02:52:18.279 align:start position:0%
something in that's going to be um
 
02:52:21.830 --> 02:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
presented in legislation this session
 
02:52:30.070 --> 02:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:33.950 --> 02:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
issues okay any hidden hands there is a
 
02:52:37.349 --> 02:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
Hidden Hand we got to do a round table
 
02:52:40.630 --> 02:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
next time representative Grossman thank
 
02:52:44.030 --> 02:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
you chairman Pearson just to piggyback
 
02:52:45.790 --> 02:52:45.800 align:start position:0%
on that I think that's one of the most
 
02:52:49.070 --> 02:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
important carve outs in this amendment
 
02:52:52.389 --> 02:52:52.399 align:start position:0%
is for those children that are possibly
 
02:52:54.510 --> 02:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
being placed in a group home or Child
 
02:52:56.990 --> 02:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
Care institution out of the states that
 
02:52:58.870 --> 02:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
they have voice and
 
02:53:01.710 --> 02:53:01.720 align:start position:0%
representation um so in terms of this
 
02:53:05.469 --> 02:53:05.479 align:start position:0%
amendment that's one of the key points
 
02:53:11.070 --> 02:53:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:15.349 --> 02:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
you there is a um
 
02:53:20.190 --> 02:53:20.200 align:start position:0%
bill that was given to me by the child
 
02:53:23.830 --> 02:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
advocate right after the big stink show
 
02:53:27.389 --> 02:53:27.399 align:start position:0%
in Tennessee broke into the public and
 
02:53:30.190 --> 02:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
they did it on the on the the very
 
02:53:33.790 --> 02:53:33.800 align:start position:0%
quick um like just about when Bill
 
02:53:36.990 --> 02:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
filing season was over and what I've
 
02:53:39.389 --> 02:53:39.399 align:start position:0%
done is because I really wanted Buy in
 
02:53:41.670 --> 02:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
by at least the
 
02:53:45.190 --> 02:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
Departments uh dcyf and also the
 
02:53:47.510 --> 02:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
children's services at
 
02:53:51.190 --> 02:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
DHHS as well as office of child advocate
 
02:53:53.349 --> 02:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
I took the language that was given to me
 
02:53:54.910 --> 02:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
by the child
 
02:53:58.150 --> 02:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
advocate and got it over to the two
 
02:54:00.469 --> 02:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
agencies at the Department of Health and
 
02:54:04.830 --> 02:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
Human Services and I asked them to work
 
02:54:07.309 --> 02:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
together to come up with language they
 
02:54:09.550 --> 02:54:09.560 align:start position:0%
could both be happy with all all three
 
02:54:13.389 --> 02:54:13.399 align:start position:0%
groups could be happy with and um
 
02:54:15.389 --> 02:54:15.399 align:start position:0%
they're really working very hard on that
 
02:54:19.429 --> 02:54:19.439 align:start position:0%
I've signed off solo really on the
 
02:54:23.630 --> 02:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
original bill that Cassandra gave to uh
 
02:54:25.830 --> 02:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
me simply because I had to I had a
 
02:54:28.269 --> 02:54:28.279 align:start position:0%
deadline but we hope that by the final
 
02:54:32.550 --> 02:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
sign off we will have that
 
02:54:35.910 --> 02:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
consensus language and whether we do or
 
02:54:37.950 --> 02:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
not of course that bill would most
 
02:54:40.990 --> 02:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
likely come to us uh next January
 
02:54:43.389 --> 02:54:43.399 align:start position:0%
February at which point we can amend it
 
02:54:45.990 --> 02:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
to make it exact L better than it has
 
02:54:49.990 --> 02:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:53.349 --> 02:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
so so there's stuff in the pipeline I
 
02:54:54.469 --> 02:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's what you were
 
02:54:58.389 --> 02:54:58.399 align:start position:0%
referring to but yes it was um Mr
 
02:55:00.349 --> 02:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
chairman I just didn't know if it was
 
02:55:02.389 --> 02:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
Germaine to our conversation right now
 
02:55:04.630 --> 02:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
so that's why I was I well if it's not
 
02:55:06.950 --> 02:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
Germaine just forget everything I just
 
02:55:10.910 --> 02:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
say okay yes uh representative
 
02:55:13.030 --> 02:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
Molton thank you Mr chairman I'm just
 
02:55:16.630 --> 02:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
wondering who is paying for the attorney
 
02:55:19.990 --> 02:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:22.790 --> 02:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
child that's not our
 
02:55:26.150 --> 02:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
St we're the policy committee I'm not
 
02:55:27.990 --> 02:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
sure who's going to pay and it'll go to
 
02:55:31.710 --> 02:55:31.720 align:start position:0%
finance so this is going to just just to
 
02:55:33.389 --> 02:55:33.399 align:start position:0%
clarify my understanding I'm not
 
02:55:34.990 --> 02:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
contentious about it or anything I'm
 
02:55:37.750 --> 02:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
just curious so because this is it
 
02:55:39.870 --> 02:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like there's a lot of different
 
02:55:41.550 --> 02:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
types of children that would be served
 
02:55:44.630 --> 02:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
by this amendment so so some of them are
 
02:55:45.910 --> 02:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
going to be foster some of them are
 
02:55:48.830 --> 02:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
going to be you know in group homes it
 
02:55:50.389 --> 02:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
says some of them are going to be in
 
02:55:52.469 --> 02:55:52.479 align:start position:0%
institutions and maybe some of them are
 
02:55:56.389 --> 02:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
private so so I is that just based on
 
02:55:58.670 --> 02:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
the judge's discretion who pays for it
 
02:56:01.990 --> 02:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
or that's why that's why I just don't
 
02:56:04.229 --> 02:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
know it doesn't
 
02:56:07.429 --> 02:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
say yeah and there's no fiscal note and
 
02:56:09.309 --> 02:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
it's not a late Bill well there is a
 
02:56:11.150 --> 02:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal note yeah oh there is on the
 
02:56:13.110 --> 02:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
original one what does it
 
02:56:16.550 --> 02:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
say is there
 
02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:20.070 align:start position:0%
say is there
yes

02:56:20.070 --> 02:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:22.790 --> 02:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
where this is the amendment I don't see
 
02:56:36.030 --> 02:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:38.309 --> 02:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah it's our friend the
 
02:56:38.319 --> 02:56:39.950 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah it's our friend the
indeterminable

02:56:39.950 --> 02:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
indeterminable
 
02:56:42.389 --> 02:56:42.399 align:start position:0%
amount so I mean I really think somebody
 
02:56:43.670 --> 02:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
else is going to have to worry about
 
02:56:45.429 --> 02:56:45.439 align:start position:0%
this and not
 
02:56:48.630 --> 02:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
US Representative
 
02:56:51.670 --> 02:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
ball when we um talked about this we did
 
02:56:55.510 --> 02:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
have representatives and uh Vice chair
 
02:56:57.630 --> 02:56:57.640 align:start position:0%
long maybe could refresh my memory but
 
02:56:59.269 --> 02:56:59.279 align:start position:0%
we had them and they came from either
 
02:57:01.110 --> 02:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
the finance committee or from the
 
02:57:04.670 --> 02:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
Judiciary but not from the and they came
 
02:57:06.710 --> 02:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
and they spoke to it and said if we
 
02:57:09.710 --> 02:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
don't pass this it will not be put into
 
02:57:12.229 --> 02:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
the budget if we pass it it will be and
 
02:57:15.030 --> 02:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
that we can't do it on speculation and
 
02:57:17.190 --> 02:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
they were actually pretty much in
 
02:57:19.950 --> 02:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
support of it from what I was told and I
 
02:57:21.590 --> 02:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
also just want to remind I didn't know
 
02:57:24.269 --> 02:57:24.279 align:start position:0%
about anything else coming um down the
 
02:57:26.070 --> 02:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
pipeline but just to remind you that we
 
02:57:30.190 --> 02:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
do have six um groups that represent the
 
02:57:32.429 --> 02:57:32.439 align:start position:0%
juvenile rights policy group as well as
 
02:57:34.590 --> 02:57:34.600 align:start position:0%
the state agency of the office of the
 
02:57:36.990 --> 02:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
child advocate that put this particular
 
02:57:39.389 --> 02:57:39.399 align:start position:0%
version together and is in support of
 
02:57:41.710 --> 02:57:41.720 align:start position:0%
it anyone
 
02:57:44.070 --> 02:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
else thank you representative balette
 
02:57:45.630 --> 02:57:45.640 align:start position:0%
that answered my
 
02:57:48.950 --> 02:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
question this is about 90% of what I
 
02:57:51.190 --> 02:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
would like and I don't want the 10% that
 
02:57:53.710 --> 02:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
isn't to be the enemy of the 90% that is
 
02:57:56.670 --> 02:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to take the win I think
 
02:57:59.710 --> 02:57:59.720 align:start position:0%
when I vote and then when we discover
 
02:58:01.790 --> 02:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some changes we can do
 
02:58:04.710 --> 02:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
that that's just me anybody
 
02:58:08.510 --> 02:58:08.520 align:start position:0%

of the playground thank
 
02:59:55.710 --> 02:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
you and um any further discussion
 
02:59:58.630 --> 02:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
because this is what we just adopted as
 
03:00:01.429 --> 03:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
the amendment is the bill but your
 
03:00:03.750 --> 03:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
second chance at it if you
 
03:00:06.429 --> 03:00:06.439 align:start position:0%
want yes representative Bickford I'll
 
03:00:08.910 --> 03:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
just reiterate my my concern which is
 
03:00:11.389 --> 03:00:11.399 align:start position:0%
the the word expressed and I feel that
 
03:00:14.030 --> 03:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
that limits the court and now it's wide
 
03:00:16.309 --> 03:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
open for the court to do what they want
 
03:00:18.229 --> 03:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
and so that's I don't want to limit the
 
03:00:20.429 --> 03:00:20.439 align:start position:0%
court in this case so that'll be my
 
03:00:22.750 --> 03:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
reasoning for voting no one okay
 
03:00:24.469 --> 03:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate thank
 
03:00:27.070 --> 03:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
you any further discussion
 
03:00:27.080 --> 03:00:28.910 align:start position:0%
you any further discussion
representative

03:00:28.910 --> 03:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:00:33.830 --> 03:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
Molton thank you Mr chairman um so that
 
03:00:35.670 --> 03:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
that would imply that the child is the
 
03:00:38.429 --> 03:00:38.439 align:start position:0%
one doing the expression or the attorney
 
03:00:42.070 --> 03:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
on their behalf
 
03:00:45.990 --> 03:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
so so you know they're they they
 
03:00:51.750 --> 03:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
can't unless unless unless a in sorry
 
03:00:53.389 --> 03:00:53.399 align:start position:0%
unless an interest of the child is
 
03:00:55.590 --> 03:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
implied because they are too young to
 
03:00:57.990 --> 03:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
speak otherwise the kid kids are very
 
03:01:00.389 --> 03:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
good at at letting you know what they're
 
03:01:02.349 --> 03:01:02.359 align:start position:0%
what they want so whether or not it's
 
03:01:04.630 --> 03:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
feasible is another thing but but kids
 
03:01:05.830 --> 03:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
are good at letting you know what they
 
03:01:10.790 --> 03:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
want well you know that sorry so in in
 
03:01:13.910 --> 03:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
response if I may I I just don't agree
 
03:01:15.830 --> 03:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
that that much I want the court to be
 
03:01:18.309 --> 03:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
able to ask whatever they want of the
 
03:01:20.429 --> 03:01:20.439 align:start position:0%
attorney that's representing the child
 
03:01:22.550 --> 03:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
and this says uhuh if a child can't
 
03:01:25.750 --> 03:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
represent can't express them then they
 
03:01:28.429 --> 03:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
they're ignored and I that's my concern
 
03:01:29.870 --> 03:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's my point is that it they're
 
03:01:32.630 --> 03:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
speaking by like Age Two so and then
 
03:01:34.110 --> 03:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
other than that they just need to be
 
03:01:36.309 --> 03:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
like fed and clothed and housed and
 
03:01:37.710 --> 03:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
things like that and love that's not
 
03:01:39.190 --> 03:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
good enough for
 
03:01:43.790 --> 03:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
me okay well representative long H yeah
 
03:01:46.190 --> 03:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um yeah I'm not
 
03:01:49.150 --> 03:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
getting where you're confused with the
 
03:01:52.910 --> 03:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
express it's the attorney is for what
 
03:01:54.790 --> 03:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
the child expresses not the best
 
03:01:56.229 --> 03:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
interest of the child it's what the
 
03:01:58.750 --> 03:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
child expresses and that's the attorney
 
03:02:01.110 --> 03:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
so where is the issue with the court not
 
03:02:02.870 --> 03:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
having leeway to do
 
03:02:06.030 --> 03:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
what uh my my concern is that the child
 
03:02:08.510 --> 03:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
may not be able to express themself and
 
03:02:10.469 --> 03:02:10.479 align:start position:0%
it's not unusual for a disabilities
 
03:02:13.349 --> 03:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
child or whatever to need to have the
 
03:02:16.229 --> 03:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
job judge of the court to be able to say
 
03:02:20.030 --> 03:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
I want you to represent this child
 
03:02:22.550 --> 03:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
ex the broad spectrum of the child not
 
03:02:24.630 --> 03:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
just what the child expresses or cannot
 
03:02:28.030 --> 03:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
express is unable to express I want the
 
03:02:32.229 --> 03:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
court to have uh the broad picture of
 
03:02:33.630 --> 03:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
what they want to get they know what
 
03:02:35.630 --> 03:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
they want I don't but that's current
 
03:02:38.070 --> 03:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
that's what happens currently yes and
 
03:02:40.550 --> 03:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
what this adds is not only does that
 
03:02:43.030 --> 03:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
happen but will also the court will also
 
03:02:45.670 --> 03:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
know what the child expresses I don't
 
03:02:48.550 --> 03:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
see that I just see that it has to be
 
03:02:50.790 --> 03:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
expressed that's how I read
 
03:02:53.429 --> 03:02:53.439 align:start position:0%
it he said he
 
03:02:58.990 --> 03:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
said okay okay representative
 
03:03:01.269 --> 03:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
ball since you mentioned the special
 
03:03:04.110 --> 03:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
education and what I'm thinking is even
 
03:03:06.630 --> 03:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
a nonverbal child can express themselves
 
03:03:10.750 --> 03:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
through pictures um through use of dolls
 
03:03:12.790 --> 03:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
through there are many ways to do it and
 
03:03:14.710 --> 03:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
I believe what is trying to say is that
 
03:03:16.389 --> 03:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
the attorney can't stand up there and
 
03:03:20.110 --> 03:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
say what the attorney thinks but he must
 
03:03:22.469 --> 03:03:22.479 align:start position:0%
represent the expressed interest how
 
03:03:23.990 --> 03:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
they get that to express whether the
 
03:03:26.349 --> 03:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
attorney has to hire an interpreter
 
03:03:28.830 --> 03:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
because the child is deaf or a sign
 
03:03:31.190 --> 03:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
language or whatever it is that the
 
03:03:33.950 --> 03:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
attorney is there specifically to
 
03:03:36.790 --> 03:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
represents the child's interests and not
 
03:03:39.190 --> 03:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
to represent anyone else's or his own
 
03:03:41.990 --> 03:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
personal viewpoints is how I'm reading
 
03:03:45.229 --> 03:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
it I thank you yeah I I still see it as
 
03:03:47.309 --> 03:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
a limitation on the
 
03:03:50.990 --> 03:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
court I like the old language better so
 
03:03:56.429 --> 03:03:56.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:59.750 --> 03:03:59.760 align:start position:0%

wrong any objection to consent
 
03:05:12.269 --> 03:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
representative this fin
 
03:05:14.990 --> 03:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
answer this will be a finance included
 
03:05:16.550 --> 03:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
so we probably should be on regular
 
03:05:18.990 --> 03:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
account all right let's put it
 
03:05:22.870 --> 03:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
well it's in determinant and it wasn't
 
03:05:26.870 --> 03:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
an early bill but it's an F so fin it's
 
03:05:29.190 --> 03:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
that all right um well then let's leave
 
03:05:32.110 --> 03:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
it off consent and have it go to regular
 
03:05:34.750 --> 03:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
calendar so representative long if you
 
03:05:36.349 --> 03:05:36.359 align:start position:0%

she's good oh sorry and seconded I'd
 
03:43:35.309 --> 03:43:35.319 align:start position:0%
like a republican to second that please
 
03:43:39.149 --> 03:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
to keep our bipartisan deimon that seems
 
03:43:41.550 --> 03:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate since this was mostly this
 
03:43:43.630 --> 03:43:43.640 align:start position:0%
was mostly the recommendations of
 
03:43:46.710 --> 03:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
Representative D Simone and well it's
 
03:43:49.510 --> 03:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
true um be because of our Collective
 
03:43:52.229 --> 03:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
efforts to figure out how this is would
 
03:43:54.189 --> 03:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
would actually work so that we're not
 
03:43:57.349 --> 03:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
held up by semantics so what this
 
03:44:01.189 --> 03:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
amendment is doing is having the courts
 
03:44:03.630 --> 03:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
develop the form because that's what
 
03:44:06.750 --> 03:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
we've came to find out is appropriate
 
03:44:10.149 --> 03:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
and we are going to have it be presented
 
03:44:13.070 --> 03:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
prior to the temporary hearing because
 
03:44:14.510 --> 03:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
that is what we collectively thought
 
03:44:16.110 --> 03:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
would be the best
 
03:44:18.550 --> 03:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
process so that's what we
 
03:44:22.910 --> 03:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:25.309 --> 03:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
discussion you know we did this in uh
 
03:44:27.269 --> 03:44:27.279 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services all the time
 
03:44:29.830 --> 03:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
we do it in real time during which is
 
03:44:31.910 --> 03:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
why we the best Committee in the house
 
03:44:35.750 --> 03:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
and you keep pushing us along to at
 
03:44:38.429 --> 03:44:38.439 align:start position:0%
least tie Health and Human Services as
 
03:44:40.189 --> 03:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
best committee and this this just
 
03:44:42.630 --> 03:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
enhances that so thank you cuz we're all
 
03:44:45.070 --> 03:44:45.080 align:start position:0%

03:44:47.710 --> 03:44:47.720 align:start position:0%

representative D Simon you know I never
 
03:47:19.630 --> 03:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
knew how to pronounce your name until I
 
03:47:22.630 --> 03:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
met the gentleman to my left Italian to
 
03:47:26.349 --> 03:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
the my grandmother's made a
 
03:47:29.389 --> 03:47:29.399 align:start position:0%
name any further
 
03:47:33.349 --> 03:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
discussion now you are in order
 
03:47:36.550 --> 03:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
sir um I'm concerned with the the word
 
03:47:41.510 --> 03:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
prior to the temporary hearing
 
03:47:44.229 --> 03:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
no it was prior to the final hearing
 
03:47:47.990 --> 03:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
which the Susan Bron said have it done
 
03:47:49.870 --> 03:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
at the temporary because I'm not sure
 
03:47:51.990 --> 03:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
what comes prior to Temporary but maybe
 
03:47:53.309 --> 03:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
someone else does
 
03:47:56.670 --> 03:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
here I can help with that who who can
 
03:47:59.990 --> 03:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
help representative Molton for a help so
 
03:48:02.469 --> 03:48:02.479 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
03:48:06.110 --> 03:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
that let me just gather my thoughts um I
 
03:48:08.070 --> 03:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
don't know that that is necessarily a
 
03:48:11.670 --> 03:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
problem with saying prior to because
 
03:48:13.630 --> 03:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
that can I I
 
03:48:16.910 --> 03:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't let me gather my
 
03:48:19.990 --> 03:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts things are only problematic if
 
03:48:22.110 --> 03:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
you bring them to the court saying like
 
03:48:23.990 --> 03:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
oh my God they didn't follow this policy
 
03:48:28.149 --> 03:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
right if the lawyers have the the whole
 
03:48:31.590 --> 03:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
reason why we wanted it to be
 
03:48:34.630 --> 03:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
the uh addendum to the child support
 
03:48:38.030 --> 03:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
calculators because the lawyers put that
 
03:48:41.710 --> 03:48:41.720 align:start position:0%
together prior to the temporary hearing
 
03:48:44.070 --> 03:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
and then you give it to the other side
 
03:48:47.110 --> 03:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
and they you know they have the same
 
03:48:51.229 --> 03:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
mechanism for um for calculating as well
 
03:48:52.830 --> 03:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
and and ideally they should come up with
 
03:48:55.630 --> 03:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
the same numbers and the what the
 
03:48:58.750 --> 03:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
parties are doing is that they're imp
 
03:49:01.349 --> 03:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
what this bill is doing is the parties
 
03:49:03.870 --> 03:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
are just implementing what do they want
 
03:49:06.590 --> 03:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
as a payment option so do they want a
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
check in the mail do they want it vend
 
03:49:11.269 --> 03:49:11.279 align:start position:0%
mode do they want it direct deposited do
 
03:49:13.590 --> 03:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
they want it cash in nickels like they
 
03:49:18.309 --> 03:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
they can say how they want it and
 
03:49:21.269 --> 03:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
I if they did it at the works I'm good
 
03:49:23.389 --> 03:49:23.399 align:start position:0%
with it if they did it at the the the
 
03:49:25.149 --> 03:49:25.159 align:start position:0%
thing is that if someone is
 
03:49:27.910 --> 03:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
prosay then the court is directing them
 
03:49:29.349 --> 03:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
and like here's all your papers and
 
03:49:30.790 --> 03:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to get like a packet of
 
03:49:33.309 --> 03:49:33.319 align:start position:0%
papers and then they can just fill it
 
03:49:35.550 --> 03:49:35.560 align:start position:0%
out at the same time as they're filling
 
03:49:37.189 --> 03:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
out all their other papers so the
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
Court's just going to give them the
 
03:49:41.229 --> 03:49:41.239 align:start position:0%
papers okay and I think if they appeared
 
03:49:43.149 --> 03:49:43.159 align:start position:0%
at the temporary hearing with it and
 
03:49:44.750 --> 03:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
didn't give it prior to I don't
 
03:49:46.189 --> 03:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily think it's going to be a
 
03:49:47.830 --> 03:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
problem because it's only a problem if
 
03:49:49.710 --> 03:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
it gets escalated to the judge and the
 
03:49:51.269 --> 03:49:51.279 align:start position:0%
judge thinks it's so much of a problem
 
03:49:52.950 --> 03:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
that they have to rule
 
03:49:56.510 --> 03:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
against so if if the prior two versus at
 
03:49:58.469 --> 03:49:58.479 align:start position:0%
the temporary hearing I don't
 
03:50:00.349 --> 03:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily think that that's a problem
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
only for someone who wants to really
 
03:50:05.910 --> 03:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
nitpick and a judge that's willing to to
 
03:50:08.229 --> 03:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
rule in their
 
03:50:08.239 --> 03:50:11.830 align:start position:0%
rule in their
favor

03:50:11.830 --> 03:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:14.030 --> 03:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
anything further on
 
03:50:19.349 --> 03:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:23.469 --> 03:50:23.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:26.469 --> 03:50:26.479 align:start position:0%
question the motion before is a to pass
 
03:50:26.479 --> 03:50:28.070 align:start position:0%
question the motion before is a to pass
