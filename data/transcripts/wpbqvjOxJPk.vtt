testimony from the New Hampshire

giving me the
 
00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity so we are concerned with
 
00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:00.759 align:start position:0%
just the space liit limitations on the
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
current driver license with the amount
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
of real estate that we have and the
 
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
amount of items that we are required to
 
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440 align:start position:0%

Vehicles might have shared an image with
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
the chair or intended to just to give
 
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
you an idea of what we have for our
 
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
limitations and the other concern that
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
we would have is we would need to
 
00:08:24.909 --> 00:08:24.919 align:start position:0%
determine what the proper documents
 
00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
would be for us to accept to prove what
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
their blood type is because with without
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
that verification step we just feel that
 
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
the data would be unreliable um if we
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
didn't have some kind of proof as to
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
what that um individual's blood type
 
00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
would be so those are just our concerns
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire DMB
 
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
standpoint okay thank you very much
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
everyone well I guess we're off to an
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
easy start I see nobody else signed up
 
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
to speak um and nobody else has uh
 
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
pre-signed up to speak so with that I'm
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing on 393
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
one with the hand up did we get did we
 
00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:17.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
sorry it was kind of a mistake I put it
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
back down but my question would be um
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
does this need to be on the the front of
 
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
the license rather than the rear of the
 
00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:30.870 align:start position:0%
the license rather than the rear of the
license

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
that I do not
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
know thank you a question for DMV we can
 
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
try to get before we exec this
 
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.550 align:start position:0%
try to get before we exec this
apparently

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
uh said something about the space
 
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
problem so it could be on either side of
 
00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
the license yeah typically every time we
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
get a bill that requests something else
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
to go on the license the real estate on
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
the license is an issue if I'm not
 
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
mistaken without me pulling mine out I
 
00:09:59.310 --> 00:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
believe most of the medical information
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
is on the back uh but I could be wrong
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
let's confirm that before we just P my
 
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
IDE out yeah yeah let's confirm that
 
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
before we exec the
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
bill it list medical conditions on the
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
back okay seeing no other people to
 
00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:15.079 align:start position:0%
speak um I'm going to close the public
 
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
legislation this
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
legislation is um another one that had
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
passed the House and Senate last term it
 
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
was um it was before Health and Human
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
Services committee last time this time
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
it chose to to bring it before
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation let me just give you a
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
little bit of context on
 
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
it uh if you look at the at the bill
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's pretty straightforward pretty
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
simple common sense um amendment in in
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
the bold that um you know it it it
 
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
refers to a person's decision to make a
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
donation that
 
00:26:18.269 --> 00:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
person's organs tissue and so forth and
 
00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
just adds the Lang A Little Bit Stronger
 
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919 align:start position:0%
language that uh after honored and may
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
not be revoked or amended by anyone
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
after such individual's death in the
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
absence of a revocation or amendment by
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
the individual Pride to death so it
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
strengthens the current
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
law it um it doesn't make a past
 
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
judgment on whether you're an organ
 
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
donor or not I I found out when I first
 
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
brought this legislation
 
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
forward that you can you can have an
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
emotional argument with people on this
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
topic and so in some states uh DMV
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
um there's a requirement that when you
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
when you get your driver's license if
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
you don't make a a a decision the state
 
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
makes the decision for you this doesn't
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
do this do that and I would never be
 
00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
interested in doing that whatever
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
decision you make is your decision and
 
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
what this bill does it strengthens that
 
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
decision so if you are an organ donor
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
and and you decide in life that you want
 
00:27:26.909 --> 00:27:26.919 align:start position:0%
to be an organ donor that on your
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
passing some can't turn around and
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
change what your essence your desire
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
your will was uh in that regard now the
 
00:27:39.389 --> 00:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
reason I brought this forward was I had
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
a constituent I used to coach a high
 
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
school ski team and it was a young man
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
that I coached that had cystic vibrosis
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
and he was up for a donation for a um
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
for a life-saving
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
operation um with a lung transplant
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh it was an individual that had passed
 
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:03.640 align:start position:0%
was 20 years of age um had
 
00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
um consented to donate his organ they
 
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
were prepping this individual to surgery
 
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
the parents changed the decision
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
afterwards he ended up passing he's the
 
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
parents have testified before in this
 
00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
bill um and
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
so I kind of reached out to them and
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
asked what what can I do as a legislator
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
to solve that problem and this is what I
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
came up with so um this is something
 
00:28:34.029 --> 00:28:34.039 align:start position:0%
that I I think it's a common sense thing
 
00:28:36.909 --> 00:28:36.919 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't again pass judgment on on
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
what your decision is it doesn't affect
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
your ability to change your
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
mind every day one day you want might
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
want to be an organ donor a week lady
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
say no I don't want to you can you can
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
change it to the DMV now there's a Mis
 
00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
Noma there that when you have the heart
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
that have that symbol in your license
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's what they go by no the DMV has
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
written document on this and that's
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
actually what they go by obviously that
 
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
alerts people the first respond is that
 
00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:02.519 align:start position:0%
you're that that's what you've decided
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
so let's say you have that on your
 
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
license because you wanted to be a donor
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
and a month later you changed your mind
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
and you haven't get your license renewed
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
they're not going to take your organs if
 
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
if youve changed your your decision so
 
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
um I know this has come up before about
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
what about minors this is for consenting
 
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
adults and I know it's not clear when
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
you look at the language it's it's in
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
the RSA and
 
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
um but I would would would just suggest
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
to you when you're cons consing adult
 
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
and depending on what you're doing in
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
this state and federally these different
 
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
ages for different things um it
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
certainly uh upon anybody's passing the
 
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
last thing you you have left is whatever
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
your will was in the case of organ
 
00:29:51.509 --> 00:29:51.519 align:start position:0%
donation it can save lives if you choose
 
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
to to make that um your choice in life
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
so just like this bill says you can't
 
00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
change if you're an ogan donor uh upon
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
your passing somebody can't change it it
 
00:30:07.149 --> 00:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
this the reverse is is true too if you
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
decideed you don't want to be a donor
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
somebody can't turn around and change it
 
00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:13.799 align:start position:0%
on your death and decide that your organ
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
is going to be donated so
 
00:30:20.509 --> 00:30:20.519 align:start position:0%
um with that um I'll open up to any
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
questions you may have and I'm asking
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
for your support for a of pass out of
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
committee because I think it's um it's
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
potentially thank you represent Roan uh
 
00:30:39.389 --> 00:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:42.679 align:start position:0%
committee repres Crawford thank you Mr
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
chair um so you said it's in the statute
 
00:30:51.509 --> 00:30:51.519 align:start position:0%
that um miners don't have I mean that
 
00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:54.039 align:start position:0%
they can it says in the statute that a
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
minor if he puts that on his license
 
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
that parents can revoke it does it say
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
that in the Statue or does it just
 
00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:04.519 align:start position:0%
because I'm concerned about 16 and 17
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
year olds putting that on their
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
application having it on their license
 
00:31:10.029 --> 00:31:10.039 align:start position:0%
with their parents without their
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
parents' permission and then God forbid
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
something happens to them and then all
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
of a sudden they're notified that their
 
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
son or daughter has become a donor or or
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
put down that they were a donor and they
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
were not aware of it would they be able
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
to revoke it um well so it's not it
 
00:31:29.789 --> 00:31:29.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't come out and say specifically
 
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
minors are excluded but the statute says
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of things in the courts have
 
00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:35.799 align:start position:0%
recognized situations like that when
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
it's a minor that in other words this m
 
00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.190 align:start position:0%
it's a minor that in other words this m
just

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:31:42.629 --> 00:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
strengthens that that content it doesn't
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change the RSA per se as to
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
what what the rule is and and the courts
 
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
have allowed in the case of a minor that
 
00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:52.519 align:start position:0%
parents can have a say in that and I
 
00:31:54.509 --> 00:31:54.519 align:start position:0%
don't know if you hear when I testified
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
before Health and Human Services the
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
organ donation people have testified IFI
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
on on on that fact and other aspects of
 
00:32:02.669 --> 00:32:02.679 align:start position:0%
what the law says so so whether you
 
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
adopt my Amendment or not it doesn't
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
change a Minor's position under the law
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change it at all it it simply
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
says when you it simply strengthens what
 
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
the language is if you're a
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
donor follow up thank you so the only
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
thing I'm concerned about is the
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
language that you've put in here it says
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
amend by anyone I I I I'm just concerned
 
00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
about 16 and 17 year olds um with that
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:41.559 align:start position:0%
all representative Gorski I see you next
 
00:32:43.389 --> 00:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and and thank you
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
representative toosan for taking my
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned that you know if
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
someone on their license says Okay I
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
want to be an organ donor and they
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
decide okay I changed my mind can you
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
just elaborate on what that process is
 
00:33:00.629 --> 00:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
that that person just does in order to
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
kind of make that
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
happen yeah so um you need to contact
 
00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
the DMV and um there's usually a form
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
you can fill out but if if you don't get
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
to that point if you have a strong
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
desire to change your mind you can
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
contact them um you know over the
 
00:33:20.669 --> 00:33:20.679 align:start position:0%
telephone or verbally obviously like
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
most things in life you'd want to make
 
00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
the the written change to make sure it's
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
recorded properly um but just like when
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
you when you decide when you first get
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
your license or when you re renew your
 
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
license whether you uh want to be an
 
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
organ donor or not it's really the same
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
process but my point is that you don't
 
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
have to wait till the next time you
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
renew your license There's No Limit
 
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
there's no um requirement to um to wait
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
you could do it right away um if you
 
00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
have a change your heart and and really
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
my my bill doesn't really change that
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
that's in law now the reason I bring it
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
up is there was some confusion when I
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
first testified on this is to most
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
people think when that Hots on your
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
license that's it not the case um it's
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
it's the written document that backs up
 
00:34:09.069 --> 00:34:09.079 align:start position:0%
that symbol on your license that's that
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
the DMV holds thank you
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
welcome I see representative tarki
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
next thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr representative
 
00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
troan um I really appreciate this um
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
attempt because I can see issues when it
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
comes to perhaps
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
older children or even um parents who um
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
say my 22-year-old son passed and wanted
 
00:34:43.629 --> 00:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
his wish was to donate his organs and I
 
00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
personally didn't believe in that I
 
00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
could revoke his wishes which I'm not
 
00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:50.919 align:start position:0%
sure that that's appropriate but that
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
leads me to my question do you aware of
 
00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:56.919 align:start position:0%
other states that have a statute that's
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
specifically protects the donor's wishes
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
like this um bill would do here in New
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yeah yeah thank you for the uh
 
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
question representative um yeah many
 
00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:10.839 align:start position:0%
states now have gone to um you know this
 
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
is something that's evolved over time um
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
and many states have um have
 
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
strengthened the language from what they
 
00:35:21.069 --> 00:35:21.079 align:start position:0%
had in years past
 
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
um in and overall this this
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
state the RSA as it's written is it's
 
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
pretty it's pretty good RSA this this
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
just strengthens it a little bit more so
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
that there's you know there's
 
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
no nothing left to to u to doubt as to
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
what the person's decision was um so I
 
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
hope I answered the
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
you representative oara oh I'm sorry
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
I'll get to L represent thank you Mr
 
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
chair so just a quick question about um
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
so my example I have an organ donor on
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
my my license I put it on there because
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
I know my next to Ken could revoke it if
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
that was their wish because I would
 
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
rather my next to Ken choose for me I
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
don't I would rather donate my organs
 
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
but if my next wants to doesn't believe
 
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
in that wants to keep my organs together
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
I would like them to have that choice
 
00:36:16.309 --> 00:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
after I pass is that something I could
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
put in my my will on my license yeah you
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
could um and that's that's interesting
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
I've never never had that question
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
before um you know you can you can do
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
that if you decide based on your
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
discussion with you next to Ken that
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
it's not a good idea that they're
 
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
against it you you can simply change in
 
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
want representative pataro thank you Mr
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative froan
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
for uh bringing this forward um going
 
00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
back a little bit to the earlier
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
discussion about um changing the the
 
00:36:59.710 --> 00:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
resident changing your mind um I'm
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
having difficulty resolving what I
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
believed up until now to be the whole
 
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
point of putting the the the badge on
 
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
the license plate and that if there is a
 
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
catastrophic accident we're talking
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
about harvesting human or organs my
 
00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:17.599 align:start position:0%
understanding was time is of the essence
 
00:37:20.349 --> 00:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
so I I don't I'm not an expert in this
 
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
so I don't have the I can't visualize
 
00:37:26.829 --> 00:37:26.839 align:start position:0%
what the mechanics are of um uh tap
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
sorry this is delicate take taking a
 
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
body and and harvesting the organs
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
making sure they're suitable care core
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
and then I thought the whole point of
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
the badge was to expedite that process
 
00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
you're saying that no no um the the
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
First Responders might call the DMB
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
first to verify or might call the
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
probate court to verify what's in the
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
web did you elaborate on this not sure
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
sure so really what and thanks for the
 
00:37:54.119 --> 00:37:55.150 align:start position:0%
sure so really what and thanks for the
question

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:37:57.069 --> 00:37:57.079 align:start position:0%
representative what it mean means is
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
that if you if you have that that symbol
 
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
in your license First Responders
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
obviously know that as far as they can
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
tell from the license that's your your
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
desire to donate your organs so there's
 
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
certain things first not necessarily
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
First Responders but I guess there may
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
be something they do but that medical
 
00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
folks do if you're an organ donor to
 
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
preserve the organ
 
00:38:22.309 --> 00:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
now in this day and age of pretty rapid
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
communication one can ascertain quite
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
quickly with the DMV whether or not
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's still your desire and just
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
because they preserve you in a way maybe
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit different than they might
 
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it's going to be carried
 
00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
out that they're going to harvest your
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
organs if if if the document again the
 
00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:45.079 align:start position:0%
legal document that allows that to go
 
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
forward is what's youly with the DMV
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
what's on your license isn't the legal
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
document it's just the symbol to allow
 
00:38:53.069 --> 00:38:53.079 align:start position:0%
first respondents to know that you want
 
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
to try to
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
preserve that individual in a way that
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
they can be done but they but it's
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
always and I think if you get testimony
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
from anybody the organ donation folks or
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
the DMV I think you'll hear that that um
 
00:39:08.309 --> 00:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
that's the process you know that the
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
legal document has to be you know thank
 
00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
honored representative aen thank you uh
 
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
troan for taking my
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
question I'm interested to know how
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
often it happens that
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
um a family decides differently than
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
what's indicated on the
 
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
license and also I have um a second
 
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
question F to follow that okay so start
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
with the first one I mean I don't have
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
question I don't have statistics to how
 
00:39:46.109 --> 00:39:46.119 align:start position:0%
often that happens I know that
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
um my discussions and I I've had many
 
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
and I've consulted with with the oran
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
donation New England or donation folks
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
and their in their legal staff that many
 
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
um obviously it's an emotional situation
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
for everybody involved particularly
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
parents I mean whether you're 17 or
 
00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
you're 20 or 25 as a parent that's an
 
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
emotional time and and they have those
 
00:40:14.589 --> 00:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
those discussions and
 
00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:16.839 align:start position:0%
um from what I understand again I can't
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
give you a number it's it's you know
 
00:40:21.309 --> 00:40:21.319 align:start position:0%
it's two out of every 10 cases or
 
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
whatever it is uh in most cases it's
 
00:40:26.589 --> 00:40:26.599 align:start position:0%
honored um uh there is a discussion
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
often times in the in the initial phase
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
of what happened because this kind of
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
situation is usually something that
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's a sudden death obviously and um
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
the motional time for parents and there
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
was often times thought that they don't
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
know if they want
 
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
to have the individual donate but um
 
00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:50.839 align:start position:0%
again and I'm you'll hear from them more
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
because I don't have the the the
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
personal experience there they do that
 
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
um most parents U are glad
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
went if the initial thought was I don't
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
want to do that because they think about
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
the aspect of what's happening to the
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
body afterwards
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
um but in their follow-up discussions uh
 
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
almost without exception parents are
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
glad that that was a choice that their
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
their loved one made it was
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
honored thank you follow well if if it
 
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
may help we do have somebody signed up
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
to speak from New England donor Services
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
they might be able to help with that
 
00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
kind of statistical questions okay but I
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
do have another question um thank you Mr
 
00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
toosan again um so I also have a
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
question with regard to
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
um that that the orgon
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
donation um should be honored but what
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
happens in the case of perhaps the
 
00:41:58.109 --> 00:41:58.119 align:start position:0%
medical community not wanting the
 
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
organ refuse because it's not suitable
 
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:01.790 align:start position:0%
organ refuse because it's not suitable
or

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:42:05.069 --> 00:42:05.079 align:start position:0%
something right so um thank you again
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative for the fall question the
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
um and you'll hear from the organ
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
donation folks on that certainly they're
 
00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
not going to if there's a disease
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
situation or a damage of some sort I
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
mean that doesn't this doesn't supersede
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
that in other words it's it's your
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
decision but if the Argan isn't suitable
 
00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
nothing in this language says they're
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
going to use a a non-suitable or an
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
organ that's that's not viable I guess
 
00:42:34.109 --> 00:42:34.119 align:start position:0%
is how we would state that so this
 
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
whether you adopt my Amendment here or
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
you don't that doesn't change the fact
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
that they're not going to use an organ
 
00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.829 align:start position:0%
that they're not going to use an organ
that's

00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:42:44.109 --> 00:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
potentially okay thank
 
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
you I see representative
 
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
Hill uh yes thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
question um I'm I'm the next of k for uh
 
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
an elderly Uncle um who donated his body
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
to Harvard he thought it was the only
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
way he was ever going to get into
 
00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
Harvard I am um I am wondering whether
 
00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
this um um legislation of yours is
 
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
dealing strictly with donation for um
 
00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
and I I'm not a fan of the word
 
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
harvesting but um if this is for medical
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
purposes but also for um anatomical
 
00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:33.640 align:start position:0%
Gifts of that nature uh to study for
 
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
science um is that something that's
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
that's dealt with in this legislation as
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
well do you know um probably not so
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
question probably not so much I mean
 
00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
again that I'm assuming he's he's put
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
this in his his uh will of life or last
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
will in Testament however you want to
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
say it and that's a a decision decision
 
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
he's made that he's put it into
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
um into a written legal document so that
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
his wishes are carried out this is
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
is as you can kind of see reading it has
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
to to do with primarily the aspect of
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
those that make the decision to donate
 
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
the organs they will be done um to
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
individuals that need them so um
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
I I I think in you you'd probably get a
 
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
better answer out of the New England
 
00:44:34.549 --> 00:44:34.559 align:start position:0%
Oran donation folks but I not so much
 
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
this is specifically for for people that
 
00:44:40.589 --> 00:44:40.599 align:start position:0%
um that have an untimely death not
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily untimely but pass and um
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
they they feel that in their death their
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
organs can can save and give people uh
 
00:44:52.109 --> 00:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
life that may not get it otherwise
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
that's really the intent quick followup
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
sure follow up um so are you saying that
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
um if I didn't want him to go to to
 
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
Harvard um I wanted him to go to
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
Colombia instead or something else are
 
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
you saying because of this I wouldn't be
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
able to change um his mind is that is
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
this covered under that same statute I
 
00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:22.839 align:start position:0%
guess as M question um thanks again for
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
the followup uh no I'm not saying that
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
at all um if that if he's made that
 
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
clear in a written document um it it
 
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
would it should be honored most likely
 
00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
would be honored because of the legal
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
contract um this this wouldn't change
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
that e you know either way whether you
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
adopt the language change here or not
 
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
would wouldn't really change is my
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
opinion in the scenario you just uh laid
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%

hb421 um my name is Sean Fitzpatrick I'm
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
senior vice president of public affairs
 
00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:38.559 align:start position:0%
for New England donor Services uh New
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
England donor Services uh runs the organ
 
00:46:44.109 --> 00:46:44.119 align:start position:0%
procurement organization which is uh
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
federally designated with the
 
00:46:48.549 --> 00:46:48.559 align:start position:0%
responsibility to recover organs and
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
tissues in New England uh including in
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
new uh New
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we we support this bill uh
 
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
it is important for folks to know that
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
already uh in New Hampshire law uh the
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
Uniform Anatomical Gift Act um it is uh
 
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:10.839 align:start position:0%
an individual's right in New Hampshire
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
to make the decision as to whether or
 
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
not they wish to be an organ and tissue
 
00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
donor uh and they have the ability to
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
make that designation known through the
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicles uh and so
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
that is an exist in law right now uh
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
what was what this bill seeks to do is
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
to put it in um the legal uh
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
terminology in a way that a Layman who
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
is reading the Uniform Anatomical Gift
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
Act in New Hampshire uh would more
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
clearly understand and although New
 
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
England donor Services works with uaas
 
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
in all of our six states often and it's
 
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
very clear to us we always think it's a
 
00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
great idea when we can make the legal
 
00:47:59.230 --> 00:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
language as plain to those people who
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
are interested in it as as possible and
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
so for that reason we support uh the
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
bill we don't object to it uh we think
 
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
it clarifies what already is in
 
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
existence and which has already been
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
passed uh by the New Hampshire
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
legislature and passed into law um I'm
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
happy to say that all 50 states in the
 
00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
US uh have revised the Uniform
 
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
Anatomical Gift Act uh to reflect the
 
00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
idea that individuals have the right to
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
make their own decision when it comes to
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
organ and tissue donation um and um to
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
kind of answer some of the questions
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
that were brought up um the uh the
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
process and Kelly if she's still on when
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
when you speak to somebody from the DMV
 
00:48:45.549 --> 00:48:45.559 align:start position:0%
she might be able to give you more
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
particulars of the of the process but um
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
the DMV has a computerized list of
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
individuals who have said that they want
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
to be donors and when they say they wish
 
00:49:00.789 --> 00:49:00.799 align:start position:0%
to authorize themselves to be donors an
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
indication is put on their license
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
however if somebody does decide to
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
change their mind um then they will
 
00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
change DMV will change the computerized
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
list to not include that person so even
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
though somebody might have the it on
 
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
their driver's licens we as New England
 
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
donor Services always go by what the DMV
 
00:49:28.109 --> 00:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
has on their computerized list and to
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
give it a quick overview when somebody
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
dies in a hospital Federal Regulations
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
require that death or impending death to
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
be reported to New England donor
 
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
services so we get a call when somebody
 
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
dies and we have the opportunity to
 
00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:45.559 align:start position:0%
check the donor registry in New
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to see if whether the person
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
who died um was registered or not the
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
symbol uh is really just a reminder for
 
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
the individual that they're Reg
 
00:49:58.750 --> 00:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
registered um ambulance drivers are not
 
00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
trained to look for it or do anything
 
00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
different uh emergency room uh
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
Physicians are not trained to look for
 
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
that designation or do anything
 
00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
different um and so it really is only at
 
00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
the point of death where somebody will
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
check the donor registry uh to determine
 
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
uh whether or not the individual had had
 
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
registered or not um the UAG is also
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
clear that uh whether or not a minor is
 
00:50:28.829 --> 00:50:28.839 align:start position:0%
registered it's the family that the and
 
00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
the parents that have the decision to
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
make the decision about donation up
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
until the age of 18 after the age of 18
 
00:50:38.349 --> 00:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
uh an individual who was registered
 
00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:41.799 align:start position:0%
their decision to donate will be will be
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
honored um and uh as well is um you know
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh is it rare for the a family to uh
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
object yes it is you know a handful of
 
00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:53.839 align:start position:0%
times a year in New England we'll have a
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
situation where a family disagrees with
 
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:01.480 align:start position:0%
the individual who who died um but the
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
the law is clear and I think that we
 
00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
have a duty to honor the decision of the
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
deceased uh in uh even in the um in the
 
00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
face of some family discomfort with
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
their their loved ones decision to to
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
save someone else's life um but
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
fortunately those occurrences are are
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
rare and usually even when you do get
 
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
some opposition by the end of the
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
process the family is often engaged and
 
00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
wanting for a a good outcome for those
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
who who receive the organs um and
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
because the decision to donate is um
 
00:51:39.069 --> 00:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
falls under gift law um that uh the
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
decision to donate is a gift but as the
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
caretakers of the of the organ we work
 
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
with transplant centers to determine
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
medical suitability of the organ and so
 
00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
if the organ is not medically suitable
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
for transplant the gift will be declined
 
00:51:57.549 --> 00:51:57.559 align:start position:0%
uh and the the organ will not be uh
 
00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
recovered also in regards to this law it
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
does not include whole body donation
 
00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
this is about uh donation uh in the
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
context of organs and tissues for the
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
purposes of transplant uh and so for
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
that reason it does not include a whole
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
body uh donation um so if there are any
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
other questions I'd be happy to uh
 
00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.950 align:start position:0%
other questions I'd be happy to uh
answer

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
THS thank you sir uh any questions from
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
the committee I see when represent
 
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
pararo thank you Mr chair and um thank
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr Fitzpatrick for coming very
 
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
helpful information by the way
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
um my question is about an individual's
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
last will and testament
 
00:52:45.309 --> 00:52:45.319 align:start position:0%
um and the hypothetical scenario in
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
which that might say they want to be
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
buried intact but the DMV might say in
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
their computer system that they're a
 
00:52:56.349 --> 00:52:56.359 align:start position:0%
donor um I'm imag imagining that the
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
DMV's computer system would come first
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
in the process and the the last will
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
would be read in Probate Court months
 
00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:06.839 align:start position:0%
later is is that a correct
 
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
assumption yeah I you know in in reality
 
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
um it is the fact that when somebody
 
00:53:18.789 --> 00:53:18.799 align:start position:0%
dies what is known at the hospital is is
 
00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
usually what what is is is followed and
 
00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
um we do the best we can obviously ly to
 
00:53:29.549 --> 00:53:29.559 align:start position:0%
understand the wishes of an individual
 
00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
and in that case the you know the law is
 
00:53:34.789 --> 00:53:34.799 align:start position:0%
clear that if somebody has died and it
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
is clear that they're in uh that they're
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
that they have already authorized
 
00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
donation uh through their driver's
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
license then the the process of donation
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
will go forward so I think and that's
 
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:49.720 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why it's really
 
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
important that even though we go by the
 
00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
computerized system is that the the the
 
00:53:56.789 --> 00:53:56.799 align:start position:0%
symbol is on the license because it
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
really does remind somebody what they
 
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
told the DMV they wanted to have happen
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
so um in the case of somebody who um who
 
00:54:10.829 --> 00:54:10.839 align:start position:0%
has different decisions on different
 
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
legal instruments of authorization it's
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
probably important for them to align
 
00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
those uh so that it's clear to the
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
family and to all those involved what
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
their uh what what their authorization
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair and thank you for that Mr
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
Fitzpatrick and I just wanted to take
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
this opportunity since you are
 
00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
representing a expert organization I I
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
just want clarification on one of my
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this is that we've been
 
00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
talking a lot about the scenarios of um
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
young people dying in car accidents or
 
00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
what have you is it true that the
 
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
elderly or um old people who die have
 
00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
natural causes their organs and their
 
00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
tissues would be viable candidates for
 
00:54:54.359 --> 00:54:56.230 align:start position:0%
tissues would be viable candidates for
donation

00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
donation
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
um organ donation um occurs rarely uh in
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
fact fewer than 2% of all hospital
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
deaths are uh considered medically
 
00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
suitable for donation for organs and
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
because you have to recall that somebody
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
has to have survive um have uh suffered
 
00:55:16.109 --> 00:55:16.119 align:start position:0%
some sort of a head trauma whether by
 
00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
accident or stroke or uh or deprivation
 
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
of oxygen due to looks at a heart attack
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
and that individual has to be um uh
 
00:55:27.069 --> 00:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
brought to the hospital stabilized in
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
the ER brought up to an ICU and on a
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
ventilator when uh while on a ventilator
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's determined that they have passed
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
away or the family makes the decision to
 
00:55:40.349 --> 00:55:40.359 align:start position:0%
withdraw the ventilator and allow their
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
loved one to pass away that occurrence
 
00:55:49.029 --> 00:55:49.039 align:start position:0%
is quite uh rare and so um you uh no
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
matter your age if you have um if you
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
die on a ventilator within the hospital
 
00:55:59.549 --> 00:55:59.559 align:start position:0%
context um you can be considered for
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
donation provided that you have good
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
organ function you're cancer free and
 
00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
and other types of uh
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
um uh medical history uh issues that
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
that that are looked at closely um but I
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
will tell you that um the major we have
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
more donors in their 50 their 40s and
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
50s than we do have uh Young age donors
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
um with the Advent of seat belts and
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
airbags and helmets and like that
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
fortunately the death of younger people
 
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh is is uh is not common uh but we do
 
00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
have many people in their 40s and 50s
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
who suffer stroke and heart attack and
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
we have more donors from stroke and
 
00:56:50.589 --> 00:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
heart attacks than we do uh from car
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
accidents thank you so
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%

in the last U hearing I just asked the
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
committee members to to try to keep it's
 
00:59:57.789 --> 00:59:57.799 align:start position:0%
a sensitive issue that's why I let it go
 
00:59:59.789 --> 00:59:59.799 align:start position:0%
but keep your questions if you can to
 
01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
what the changes in the bill actually
 
01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
are uh it's nice to get information in a
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
broad spectrum when we have these
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
experts but in fact we are really just
 
01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the change to the law so you

01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
Jose cell I am a state representative
 
01:00:51.549 --> 01:00:51.559 align:start position:0%
for Marat County District 9 representing
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
the towns of Canterbury and Lowden uh I
 
01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
would also like to add that there is an
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that will be put forth on this
 
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
bill uh basically changing the language
 
01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
from kidneys to organs um having said
 
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
that I speak to you today on behalf of
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
HP 583 as a person that just received
 
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
the lifesaving kidney transplant this
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
past February 26 2020 I was excessively
 
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
blessed to receive this gift as I had
 
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
already been on dialysis and on the
 
01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
transplant list for over four and a half
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
years I'm sponsoring this bill as a way
 
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
to pay it forward by advocating for our
 
01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens that are still
 
01:01:32.349 --> 01:01:32.359 align:start position:0%
waiting for life-saving
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
organs in our current state system New
 
01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire drivers designate whether they
 
01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:39.400 align:start position:0%
want to be an organ donor because
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses are legal documents in
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this bill would merely
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
extend those desires legally to be
 
01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
directed towards New Hampshire residents
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
first and our State Drivers I'm sorry
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
our state driver's licenses are just
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
like a will it is legal document taking
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
it a step further this bill enables a
 
01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
neighbor to help one's neighbor a
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
tradition which has been a trait of all
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents since the
 
01:02:07.069 --> 01:02:07.079 align:start position:0%
establishment of the colony if asked I
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
truly believe that potential donors
 
01:02:11.549 --> 01:02:11.559 align:start position:0%
would unequivocally want the choice for
 
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:13.240 align:start position:0%
their organs to be given to a New
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident first there's a
 
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
precedence for this type of donation The
 
01:02:21.549 --> 01:02:21.559 align:start position:0%
Uniform Anatomical organ Gift Act of
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
1983 84 said that Ed donation of one's
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
organs at the time of death is
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
acceptable and encouraged furthermore
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
the concept of allowing States the
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to find their citizen organs
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
from donors from their respective state
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
was implemented in our region in the
 
01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.750 align:start position:0%
was implemented in our region in the
early

01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
early
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
1990s I will point out that our New
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
England region includes Maine New
 
01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Connecticut Rhode Island
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and half of
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
Vermont the Act was modified by giving
 
01:02:56.269 --> 01:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
extra points for distances closest to
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
the donor a rule known as the verdict
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
plan this provided more organs for our
 
01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:03.640 align:start position:0%
citizens in New Hampshire because New
 
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a donor State what I mean
 
01:03:09.069 --> 01:03:09.079 align:start position:0%
by that is that proportional to our
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
population we donate 40% more organs
 
01:03:15.309 --> 01:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
than Massachusetts and 30.4% more than
 
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
Connecticut as an example the berdick
 
01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
plan allowed for shorter time that the
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
organs were without blood supply and
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
also reduced the damage to organs from
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
longer time being spent on the ice that
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
they were backed in Dr shabanian the
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
program and medical director of the
 
01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
transplant program at Dartmouth tells me
 
01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
that in the late 1990s in the early part
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
of the century dartmouth's cold esmic
 
01:03:43.789 --> 01:03:43.799 align:start position:0%
time that is the time that an organ is
 
01:03:46.029 --> 01:03:46.039 align:start position:0%
out of the body and on Ice used to
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
average four to five hours now it is
 
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
almost always greater than 12 hours and
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
in many cases nearly 24 or more hours
 
01:03:56.589 --> 01:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
this results in the damage of to the
 
01:03:58.990 --> 01:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
organs because there is a finite time
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
necessary to implant them into the
 
01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
recipient unfortunately the verdict plan
 
01:04:06.269 --> 01:04:06.279 align:start position:0%
was abandoned because it was felt that
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
states not designated as donor states
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
were at a
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
disadvantage The Uniform Anatomical Gift
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
Act is a regulation not a federal law it
 
01:04:17.789 --> 01:04:17.799 align:start position:0%
dictates the distribution of organs in
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
the United States it is regulated by an
 
01:04:22.269 --> 01:04:22.279 align:start position:0%
agency contracted by the federal
 
01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
government known as Unos United Network
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
for organ sharing their function is
 
01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
simply to implement and monitor organ
 
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
distribution with all transplant centers
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
who are
 
01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
members nowhere in their regulation does
 
01:04:38.309 --> 01:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
it say that when agreeing to become an
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
organ donor that a person gives up the
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
right to whom the organs may go if we if
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
one looks at our state constitution and
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
our Bill of Rights individual rights
 
01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
preclude those of the state or country
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
when it involves personal decision
 
01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
making such as freedom of speech
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
religion or assembly organs belong to
 
01:04:59.470 --> 01:04:59.480 align:start position:0%
the individual and a decision to decide
 
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
where one's organs go to at the time of
 
01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:04.119 align:start position:0%
death belong with that individual so why
 
01:05:07.269 --> 01:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
would anyone argue against an individual
 
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
giving the individual a right and a
 
01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
choice to designate their organs to
 
01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
their fellow State
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
citizens there is also there are also
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
important medical issues to consider for
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
example for every year a person is on
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
dialysis waiting for a kidney transplant
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
there's a 7% chance he or she will die
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
this risk is cumulative so in other
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
words seven years on dialysis an
 
01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
individual has a 49% chance of dying the
 
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
longer person is on the weight list the
 
01:05:35.789 --> 01:05:35.799 align:start position:0%
more likely that they will die before
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
getting a life-saving organ this is true
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
for every organ this bill will allow
 
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
more of our citizens to be transplanted
 
01:05:45.309 --> 01:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that we are a donor
 
01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
State again we have a higher percentage
 
01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
of donors relative to population in our
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
surrounding states sadly Dr shabanian
 
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
has informed me that the waiting times
 
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
are increasing and have been for the
 
01:05:59.269 --> 01:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
last decade Advanced Medical therapies
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
have extended the average life
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
expectancy of our citizens more people
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
are being listed for transplants every
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
day the need for donated organs has
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
never been
 
01:06:11.069 --> 01:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
greater in advantage of passing this
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
bill in our state will be to address the
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
needs of our citizens directly by
 
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
allowing our citizens to choice to help
 
01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:20.359 align:start position:0%
fellow Citizens first if other states
 
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
follow our lead and adopt this process
 
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
then neighbors can feel good about
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
giving organs to their neighbors the
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
whole concept of paying it forward can
 
01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
become a process for unprecedented
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
donations of course if the donor organs
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
cannot be matched to fellow citizens in
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
our state then they obviously will be
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
offered to other nearby states there
 
01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
would be no discarding of organs because
 
01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
change in New Hampshire we are currently
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
averaging 40 donors annually that's 80
 
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
lungs 80 kidneys 40 Hearts 40 pancreases
 
01:06:58.109 --> 01:06:58.119 align:start position:0%
40 livers 40 guts and 80 corneas along
 
01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
with innumerable skin and cartilage uses
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
there are approximately 150 to 200 or
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
more citizens listed for organs
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
throughout the Six States of our New
 
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
England region no matter where a New
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizen is listed within that
 
01:07:15.069 --> 01:07:15.079 align:start position:0%
Region's medical transplant centers this
 
01:07:16.829 --> 01:07:16.839 align:start position:0%
bill would give them a much better
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to receive an organ from a
 
01:07:21.069 --> 01:07:21.079 align:start position:0%
fellow New Hampshire citizen that has
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
designated New Hampshire first in close
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill New Hampshire will
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
be leading the way for other states to
 
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
encourage promote and increase donations
 
01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
Nationwide making every state and local
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
a donor State thank you very
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
committee none thank you very much we
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
have hold
 
01:07:53.309 --> 01:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
on from the committee yeah
 
01:07:53.319 --> 01:08:00.950 align:start position:0%
on from the committee yeah
representative

01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.109 --> 01:08:04.119 align:start position:0%
chairman I didn't your blend your hand
 
01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
was hiding in the window that's oh okay
 
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
sorry about that just one quick question
 
01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:12.200 align:start position:0%
um if I understood the testimony
 
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
correctly um and thank you for taking my
 
01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
question Mr cambrose um this is based on
 
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
citizenship not the location of the
 
01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:24.839 align:start position:0%
patient uh what I was wondering about is
 
01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
if if a New Hampshire citizen in France
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
for instance is receiving medical help
 
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
in a Boston hospital this is really
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
based on their New Hampshire citizenship
 
01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
not based on the geography of where uh
 
01:08:41.709 --> 01:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
the transplant is taking place is that
 
01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct in the sense
 
01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
that the it is still a New Hampshire
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
citizen they may have been registered in
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
Boston because people are allowed to do
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
that it's within the region um but but
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh they would this would give them an
 
01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
advantage because they do live in New
 
01:08:59.789 --> 01:08:59.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and therefore they would be
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
closer to the uh to the organ donor who
 
01:09:06.030 --> 01:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
would have passed away in new
 
01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
here thank
 
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
you and I would like to if I could just
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
make one more comment that uh as you
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
heard an earlier earlier testimony in an
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
earlier Bill uh there was a concern
 
01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
about taking up uh real estate on the
 
01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
license this wouldn't do that there was
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
already a heart icon on the license and
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
as as you heard from New England donor
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh the the this change would only need
 
01:09:34.349 --> 01:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
to take effect by making the designation
 
01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:37.400 align:start position:0%
in the DMV registry so that's a simple
 
01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh again written document and it would
 
01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.349 --> 01:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
lki thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:09:54.669 --> 01:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative kimal
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
I just need you to clarify something
 
01:09:58.110 --> 01:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
because I I didn't catch it if you
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
stated it will if this bill passes will
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
residency supersede medical medical need
 
01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
so if I need a a kidney but I'm not as
 
01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
sick a patient in LOL Massachusetts the
 
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
patient in LOL is sicker would my
 
01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
residency supersede that person's need
 
01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:27.590 align:start position:0%
residency supersede that person's need
in

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts yeah thank you for the
 
01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
question representative uh if I may uh
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
may I defer that question to a future
 
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
speaker Dr shanian because he has he has
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
all any questions regarding to data and
 
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
statistics and that of that nature he
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
will be able to speak to and I'm happy
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
to take any questions from a personal
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
perspective having been a donor having
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
been a recipient myself thank you thank
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
you very
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%

01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned something about that you were
 
01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:09.640 align:start position:0%
going to submit an amendment what was
 
01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
you wanted to
 
01:11:13.229 --> 01:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
change uh the amendment has been
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
presented to the committee and simply it
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
has changed the the word kidney and
 
01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
kidneys to organ and organs and and I
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
had apologize for uh when the bill was
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
introduced we were on a time limit and
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%

recipient I put the word I use the word
 
01:11:36.189 --> 01:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
kidneys inadvertently I should have put
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
organs and that is what the amendment
 
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
will will
 
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:43.480 align:start position:0%

representative

01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
you looking for Dr once again Dr Michael
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%

again great well thank you for the
 
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uhh testify on behalf of
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
this bill uh I'll get to uh
 
01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.550 align:start position:0%
this bill uh I'll get to uh
representative

01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh's uh question in a minute um this
 
01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
this idea I find is rather
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
unique uh New Hampshire was be the first
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
state in all 50 states to make this a
 
01:12:33.070 --> 01:12:33.080 align:start position:0%
option for citizens to provide
 
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
life-saving organs for fellow citizens
 
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
but it wouldn't detract in any way shape
 
01:12:42.669 --> 01:12:42.679 align:start position:0%
or form uh whether or not somebody else
 
01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
who is not a citizen of the State uh to
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
get a life-saving organ now that would
 
01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
be up to changes that would be made at
 
01:12:57.229 --> 01:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
the uh organ bank or our orgon
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
procurement organization which is New
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
England donor
 
01:13:03.149 --> 01:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
Services uh there would be decisions
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
made about prioritizing and we do that
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
all the time so for example if a person
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
needed a heart kidney transplant that's
 
01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
uh considered life saving because the
 
01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
heart is a organ that is absolutely
 
01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
mandatory to make any other organ
 
01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
functional so if you needed a heart
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
kidney and you were on a um high
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
priority list or a liver kidney or a
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
lung kidney you would certainly be given
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
that opportunity to get that organ prior
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
to somebody uh for kidney alone uh why
 
01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
is that because dialysis uh is a way to
 
01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
replace kidney function it's certainly
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
not adequate adequate to extend a per
 
01:13:50.629 --> 01:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
person's life like a transplant would be
 
01:13:54.189 --> 01:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
but it certainly would be um uh a sort
 
01:13:56.669 --> 01:13:56.679 align:start position:0%
of a bridge toward waiting for that
 
01:13:59.229 --> 01:13:59.239 align:start position:0%
person to get a kidney so individuals
 
01:14:03.149 --> 01:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
who uh currently are listed are listed
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
as if kidney alone or kidney with other
 
01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
organs and it's the other organ that
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
makes a decision now let's take for
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
example the person who is a New
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident who is listed at Mass
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
General looking for a liver and a kidney
 
01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
well that would uh you know as long as
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
the other people ahead of that person
 
01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
would not need that combination that
 
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
person could get a liver kidney
 
01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
sooner and again why because uh New
 
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a donor State I think the
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
most important thing to discuss and this
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
idea is uh truly remarkable because uh
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative cell came to me and it
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
was obvious to me that his uh being so
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
grateful for having had the opportunity
 
01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
to get a transplant where other people
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
do not uh he came to me with this idea
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
that he had to do something uh to pay
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
back as he said he's so elent he said in
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
his speech and I think uh if one thinks
 
01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
about the uniqueness of this uh
 
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
possibility it is the individual's right
 
01:15:23.629 --> 01:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
that the only time that a organ
 
01:15:23.639 --> 01:15:25.229 align:start position:0%
that the only time that a organ
procurement

01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
procurement
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
organization excuse me or a uh or the
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
federal regulations in this particular
 
01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
matter would
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
supersede uh that individual's right uh
 
01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
would be under these circumstances as uh
 
01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
representative tersi said uh that there
 
01:15:47.790 --> 01:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
would be an issue with other organs but
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
I think it is the person's right and I
 
01:15:53.229 --> 01:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
think Jose I don't want to say Jose I
 
01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
know him very well we're friends uh but
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative cambrell what he is
 
01:16:02.189 --> 01:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
saying is uh that it it is an
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
individual's right to even decide uh for
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
that person to decide whether or not
 
01:16:11.310 --> 01:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
their organ should go to a neighbor uh
 
01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
it is their right uh there has been uh
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
precedents before as he said with
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
directed donation where you actually
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
name that person but in this particular
 
01:16:25.709 --> 01:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
uh uh point it's uh basically name
 
01:16:29.229 --> 01:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
naming your neighbor as a potential
 
01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
recipient on your behalf and that it
 
01:16:35.709 --> 01:16:35.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh it doesn't Prejudice the
 
01:16:35.719 --> 01:16:36.910 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh it doesn't Prejudice the
decision

01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
to uh give that kidney to a person of a
 
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
certain race a person's sex uh sexual
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
orientation uh it doesn't uh preclude
 
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
any of that uh it's basically saying I
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
would rather
 
01:16:56.910 --> 01:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
uh make the choice of somebody in my
 
01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
state having that
 
01:17:02.669 --> 01:17:02.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh first if every other
 
01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
parameter fits like it's appropriate
 
01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
number one the person is a good
 
01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
candidate number two no matter where
 
01:17:13.149 --> 01:17:13.159 align:start position:0%
that candidate is listed number three
 
01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
and whether or not uh there is other
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances such as uh
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
life-threatening circumstances where
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
somebody who wasn't a resident of the
 
01:17:25.709 --> 01:17:25.719 align:start position:0%
state should be able to receive that uh
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
that life saving gift as well and there
 
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
would be exceptions and that those
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
exceptions would have to be determined
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
at the organ procurement level uh uh
 
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
through New England donor services or
 
01:17:41.229 --> 01:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
through the New England or uh through
 
01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
United networ for orgon sharing but I
 
01:17:49.149 --> 01:17:49.159 align:start position:0%
think one last word I do believe that uh
 
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
I've been here since 1997 I've spent uh
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
40 years in transplant and I can tell
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
you this is an amazing state for
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
donation rates and you should all be
 
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
proud of all your citizens for providing
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:16.629 --> 01:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
representative um rep this is
 
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
representative Sy did you call on me
 
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
chairman yes I did okay that that that
 
01:18:26.629 --> 01:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
last piece who you were calling I missed
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
it I do have a question of the chair um
 
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's pretty clear to me that there
 
01:18:35.229 --> 01:18:35.239 align:start position:0%
are two broad policy issues that work
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
here one clearly belongs before this
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
committee which is the real estate and
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
how to designate
 
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
um this intent on the driver's
 
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
license but there's also a lot of
 
01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
questions about the Health and Human
 
01:18:53.550 --> 01:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
Services aspect of this this and I
 
01:18:56.629 --> 01:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
wonder is this bill going to a second
 
01:19:00.629 --> 01:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
committee uh it's we have no bills uh I
 
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
sh you concern gotten it or not I ask
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
but is not going to at this
 
01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
committee

01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:24.510 align:start position:0%
committee
representative

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:25.270 align:start position:0%
representative
thank

01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
my question goes
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
to uh does this
 
01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
law is this kind in law saying that if I
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
have my donor I'm a donor person which I
 
01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
am uh on my license that I have the
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
option of making sure that my organ only
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
goes to a New Hampshire person or does
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
this law make it
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
so me as a donor I am going to not allow
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
first choice of whoever needs it most
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
but they have to be in New Hampshire
 
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
person is that a question to me or to
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
this the speaker this is to whoever
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
could answer the question as far as I
 
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
understand it's still a choice you don't
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to uh check the box
 
01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
that says New Hampshire only right this
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
would be if you choose to go to New
 
01:20:30.189 --> 01:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire only that would be your
 
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
choice thank
 
01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%

Alexandra Glazer I'm the president and
 
01:21:09.629 --> 01:21:09.639 align:start position:0%
CEO of New England donor services and I
 
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
know my colleague Sean Fitzpatrick has
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
already provided the committee with some
 
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
information regarding our organization
 
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
New England donor Services were
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
responsible for the Oregon procurement
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
organization that covers the six New
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
England States including New Hampshire
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the opportunity to
 
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
speak today about House Bill
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
583 and I want to make sure that I
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
provide the committee some really
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
critical information regarding how the
 
01:21:39.790 --> 01:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
system of organ allocation currently
 
01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
functions and why um this bill would
 
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
actually be preempted by federal law so
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
first I do want to just say that um the
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have this discussion is
 
01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
really important and that we we share
 
01:21:55.709 --> 01:21:55.719 align:start position:0%
the concerns uh and the views generally
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
that were raised in terms of the
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
importance of ensuring that organs are
 
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
available for New Hampshire residents
 
01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
that are in need of any transplantation
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
as it already mentioned for those New
 
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents seeking heart
 
01:22:11.709 --> 01:22:11.719 align:start position:0%
transplantation liver transplantation
 
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
lung transplantation they are traveling
 
01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
out of state and that sets the stage for
 
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that we really um operate organ
 
01:22:23.229 --> 01:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
donation and transplantation as a awide
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
Network and with some regionality as
 
01:22:27.790 --> 01:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
well our own organization serving the
 
01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
Six States in recognition of the fact
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
that both donors and patients in need of
 
01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
transplant really aren't in one location
 
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh they they travel everywhere in our
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
region we've had a 46% increase in organ
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
donations since
 
01:22:45.629 --> 01:22:45.639 align:start position:0%
2015 and I'm pleased to say that all of
 
01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
our states have contributed to that I
 
01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
did hear some statistics earlier that I
 
01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
do want to correct um New Hampshire has
 
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
an excellent trans uh donation rate but
 
01:22:58.510 --> 01:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
it is actually similar and lower than
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um New Hampshire had 29
 
01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
donors for example in 2020 which is
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
fantastic Massachusetts had
 
01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
177 when you calculate that as donors
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
per million population Massachusetts is
 
01:23:13.709 --> 01:23:13.719 align:start position:0%
at about
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
84.8 donors per million and New
 
01:23:17.709 --> 01:23:17.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is at
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
73.6 and I'm raising this information um
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
only to say that I think think all of
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
our states in New England have excellent
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
donation rates let me talk a little bit
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
about the national system the um there's
 
01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
a federal statute the uh it's called
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
Nota the national organ transplant act
 
01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:39.400 align:start position:0%
it's at 42 USC
 
01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
273 and what that did was it established
 
01:23:44.189 --> 01:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
a national system of donation and
 
01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
transplantation a number of decades ago
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
and directs the optn and as already
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned that's run by Unos United
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
Network for organ sharing to uh maintain
 
01:23:56.430 --> 01:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
the national weight list for all those
 
01:23:58.110 --> 01:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
patients who are in need of
 
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
transplantation and then also to provide
 
01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
and establish a national system to match
 
01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
the organs that become available to the
 
01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:07.719 align:start position:0%
individuals who are listed for
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
transplantation regardless of where
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
they're listed the uh primary
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the OPN and allocation
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
policies is to ensure that all organs
 
01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
that are recovered are allocated to all
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
patients in need and specific
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
that they be distributed quote this is
 
01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
in federal law as broadly as possible uh
 
01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
in Geographic areas as feasible and to
 
01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
balance principles of both utility
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
meaning which patients are in the most
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
need for example who's most acutely ill
 
01:24:42.270 --> 01:24:42.280 align:start position:0%
most severely in need of an immediate
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
transplant as well as principles of
 
01:24:46.109 --> 01:24:46.119 align:start position:0%
equity meaning how long that they've
 
01:24:49.870 --> 01:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
been waiting so um the the national
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
framework for organ allocation preempt
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
State based allocation which is
 
01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
essentially what this bill would be
 
01:25:01.109 --> 01:25:01.119 align:start position:0%
seeking to do prioritize patients
 
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
waiting based on their their place of
 
01:25:07.709 --> 01:25:07.719 align:start position:0%
residence rather than their medical need
 
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh or how long that they've been waiting
 
01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
so I do want to address the fact that
 
01:25:14.189 --> 01:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
the uaga which has already been
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned the Uniform Anatomical Gift
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
Act is a state-based law New Hampshire
 
01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
has the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act as
 
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
does every other state and that does
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
allow individuals to direct a donation
 
01:25:29.070 --> 01:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
of their organs to a particular
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
individual and this decision uh in the
 
01:25:35.149 --> 01:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
Uniform Anatomical Gift Act of state law
 
01:25:38.189 --> 01:25:38.199 align:start position:0%
was made in recognition of the fact that
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
um directing organs to a group of
 
01:25:43.149 --> 01:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
individuals could have very significant
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
and concerning consequences we do not
 
01:25:48.189 --> 01:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
want individuals directing organs based
 
01:25:50.990 --> 01:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
on as already mentioned either sex or
 
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
race Maybe political views uh or or
 
01:25:56.830 --> 01:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
anything else that there's a recognition
 
01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
that to best serve Nationwide the
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
patients who are waiting for transplant
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
regardless of where they live is to
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
prioritize those patients who are
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
sickest and have been waiting the
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
longest and so essentially um I also
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
want to mention that there's been
 
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
National Gallop polls as recently as
 
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
2019 that show overwhelmingly that the
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
public wants to donate their organs to
 
01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
those most in need versus those that
 
01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
live closest to them and so I think we
 
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
need to you know keep that in mind but
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
most importantly recognize that this is
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
a federal system of allocation and that
 
01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
statute thank you very
 
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
much I see you pointing I was just
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
raised my hand oh okay uh questions from
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
the committee I see representative har
 
01:26:54.189 --> 01:26:54.199 align:start position:0%
can I ask a question to the chair real
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
quick sure um is this this bill just
 
01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
makes it optional right it doesn't
 
01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
require every kidney or organ to go to
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first if they choose to donate
 
01:27:05.310 --> 01:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
their organs that is my understanding so
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
if someone wants their organs to be
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
spread out for everyone they can choose
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:18.430 --> 01:27:18.440 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
Graford thank you Mr chair I just need
 
01:27:23.229 --> 01:27:23.239 align:start position:0%
some clarification on Mr bler do you
 
01:27:24.669 --> 01:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
have written
 
01:27:27.070 --> 01:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
testimony yes uh we submitted written
 
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
testimony this
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
morning it was
 
01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
submitted to the committee yes it was
 
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
submitted online I
 
01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
believe I did not receive it do you
 
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
think you could send it again um
 
01:27:42.430 --> 01:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely we could we could make sure
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
to do that I'll Sean Fitzpatrick uh I
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
believe submitted it for us and I'm just
 
01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
checking with him I know that it went
 
01:27:51.629 --> 01:27:51.639 align:start position:0%
this morning electronically but I will
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
confirm and the written testimony
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
includes the citations to the federal
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
statute and
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
regulation I have it I can send it to
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
you if you want I I have Sean
 
01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
Fitzpatrick I wanted her testimony is
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
that the Yes mine a separate one on
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:19.709 --> 01:28:19.719 align:start position:0%
you represent thank you Mr chair and
 
01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Glazier for uh taking my
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
question so um can you clarify a little
 
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
bit again U about so somebody passes
 
01:28:33.870 --> 01:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
away and their their organs are
 
01:28:37.629 --> 01:28:37.639 align:start position:0%
available how is it determined or where
 
01:28:42.109 --> 01:28:42.119 align:start position:0%
those organs end up because if somebody
 
01:28:45.629 --> 01:28:45.639 align:start position:0%
of who's in need is further away than
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
someone who perhaps is in less of need
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
that is closer by um you know time is of
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
the essence to get those organs
 
01:28:58.109 --> 01:28:58.119 align:start position:0%
transplanted so who determines where it
 
01:29:00.750 --> 01:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
goes yes great question I'd be happy to
 
01:29:03.550 --> 01:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
answer that um under the federal statute
 
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
the direction is for the optn um which
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
is the organ procurement and Transplant
 
01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
Network created by that statute and is
 
01:29:13.109 --> 01:29:13.119 align:start position:0%
currently run by the United Network of
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
organ sharing Unos as you already
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned to develop allocation policies
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
that distribute the organs primarily
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
based on as I me mentioned medical need
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
so urgency how urgent is the patient's
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
need uh as well as Equity factors like
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
for example with kidneys how long the
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
patient has been waiting but taking into
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
account your point about distribution
 
01:29:38.229 --> 01:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
there are Geographic limitations on the
 
01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:41.119 align:start position:0%
circles so to speak of distribution of
 
01:29:43.229 --> 01:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
where that organ would be offered so
 
01:29:46.270 --> 01:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
that is what prevents for example if an
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
organ is available in New Hampshire for
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
it being offered to a highly urgent
 
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
patient that's in Cal California because
 
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
the organ would not be viable to travel
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
all that way to California but it
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
certainly would be viable to travel to
 
01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
Boston uh or to other areas that are
 
01:30:05.229 --> 01:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
within um a proximity that's been
 
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
calculated by the medical experts to
 
01:30:09.109 --> 01:30:09.119 align:start position:0%
still maintain the viability of the
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
organ and this is organs specific so
 
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
kidneys for example can stay out of the
 
01:30:16.590 --> 01:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
body and still be viable for transplant
 
01:30:19.629 --> 01:30:19.639 align:start position:0%
over a longer period of time than hearts
 
01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
or livers or lungs and even medical
 
01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
criteria significantly change with
 
01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
Innovation we know that recently we've
 
01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
had preservation techniques and even
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
devices now that are used that allow the
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
organ to remain viable over longer
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
periods of time such that the
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
distribution through these allocation
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
policies can be expanded so we're always
 
01:30:43.390 --> 01:30:43.400 align:start position:0%
prioritizing the sickest Patient First
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
within a viability I do want to also add
 
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
that the allocation policies are
 
01:30:50.669 --> 01:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
developed through Community input and
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input the
 
01:30:54.350 --> 01:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
United Network for organ sharing and the
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
OPN has committees that are established
 
01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh there are representatives from those
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
committees from from every region
 
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
including ours and there's also
 
01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity for public comment whenever
 
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
these allocation policies are considered
 
01:31:11.149 --> 01:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
for revision so there is a lot of
 
01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for input both from the
 
01:31:15.390 --> 01:31:15.400 align:start position:0%
medical from a patient and from a public
 
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
perspective on how the organ should be
 
01:31:19.629 --> 01:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
prioritized but what the statute really
 
01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
set out and the reason why I believe
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 583 is pre preempted is that
 
01:31:26.950 --> 01:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
the system of organ allocation
 
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
distribution needs to be a nationwide n
 
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
network so that we can serve all
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.709 --> 01:31:37.719 align:start position:0%
live thank you thank
 
01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:40.639 align:start position:0%

01:31:40.639 --> 01:31:42.149 align:start position:0%
you I see no other questions from the
committee

01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you very

um you see I don't see anybody else
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak on this
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
bill uh do we have any additional hands
 
01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
up you have the doctor yeah well he has
 
01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:01.830 align:start position:0%
up you have the doctor yeah well he has
already

01:32:01.830 --> 01:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:32:04.109 --> 01:32:04.119 align:start position:0%
testified um if there's any other
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
information that the doctor would like
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
to provide get it to the committee but I
 
01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
can't let people testify twice in the
 
01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:10.709 align:start position:0%
can't let people testify twice in the
same

01:32:10.709 --> 01:32:10.719 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:32:13.149 --> 01:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
hearing um again it's easy to get the
 
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
information to us if there's something
 
01:32:19.149 --> 01:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
you need for but um so seeing no other
 
01:32:22.109 --> 01:32:22.119 align:start position:0%

public hearing on House Bill 174 an act
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
relative to reporting a collision
 
01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
between a cat and a motor
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
vehicle welcome representative
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
abis thank you members of the committee
 
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh for taking the time to hear hear my
 
01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
testimony today and for your
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
consideration of House Bill
 
01:35:23.470 --> 01:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
174 I under the current law if if you're
 
01:35:26.109 --> 01:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
operating a motor vehicle and you were
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
to strike a a cat there's no legal
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
obligation of that the driver to report
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
the incident whether to the owner of the
 
01:35:39.149 --> 01:35:39.159 align:start position:0%
animal or to the authorities however
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
under the current law there is an
 
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
obligation to
 
01:35:46.109 --> 01:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
report that you struck a dog with your
 
01:35:48.750 --> 01:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh what this bill essentially
 
01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
does would put a cat and a dog in the
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
same stand in regards to that the
 
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
penalty for not reporting it and again
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
you're not obligate to necessarily
 
01:35:59.149 --> 01:35:59.159 align:start position:0%
report it to the owner I understand
 
01:36:01.229 --> 01:36:01.239 align:start position:0%
requiring someone to stop and may be a
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
sensitive situation they either have to
 
01:36:06.669 --> 01:36:06.679 align:start position:0%
report it to the own or report it to uh
 
01:36:09.550 --> 01:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
whether animal control or a fishing game
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
or to the local police so but under the
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
law as it's written today literally if
 
01:36:18.270 --> 01:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
I'm driving my vehicle in front of your
 
01:36:20.189 --> 01:36:20.199 align:start position:0%
house and strike your animal your cat
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
with my car I can wave it and still
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
drive away which I understand we I would
 
01:36:27.149 --> 01:36:27.159 align:start position:0%
assume most of us agree morally what the
 
01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
right thing to do would be but there is
 
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
literally no penalty for that had I but
 
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
had it been a dog I would be required to
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
start uh what what I would say is under
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
the lot when it comes to property rights
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
which an animal whether a dog or a cat
 
01:36:45.629 --> 01:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
it is you own the animal you do have a
 
01:36:47.950 --> 01:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
property rights interest in that animal
 
01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
and the way the was written if you were
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
to strike statute of a fake cat you have
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
to stop and report that so literally
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
under the the way the law is
 
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
written a statute of a cat has more
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
protection than a real life
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
cat I so I would also point out
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
that some people feel that if you strike
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
a cat with your car you're not going to
 
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
know I I unfortunately and I know from
 
01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
experience I've been on the wrong side
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
of this on both ends I've had my own pet
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
run over and not the driver not stopped
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately I also once struck a
 
01:37:27.629 --> 01:37:27.639 align:start position:0%
cat with my vehicle I will say that it
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
was no question that I hit something it
 
01:37:34.109 --> 01:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
was very clear right away it there's I
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
don't believe any driver would not
 
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
notice that they did that and I was
 
01:37:40.350 --> 01:37:40.360 align:start position:0%
driving a truck at the time much larger
 
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
than a typical smaller sedan
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
so what I would also point out is if
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
some people are are questioning
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
about people you know the pet owner
 
01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
should take responsibility to keep their
 
01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
animals protected on their property
 
01:37:59.070 --> 01:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
although I agree with the logic of that
 
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
I will say that that logic also defeats
 
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
the purpose of having the penalty for
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
striking a dog I assume people if their
 
01:38:07.550 --> 01:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
dog gets loose and is struck by an
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
animal it it's not necessarily
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
intentionally yet they still have this
 
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
property rights protection under law so
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
the just that argument I understand but
 
01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that that's a
 
01:38:18.189 --> 01:38:18.199 align:start position:0%
justification for excluding a cat but
 
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
not a
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
dog I understand that there's also Al
 
01:38:23.229 --> 01:38:23.239 align:start position:0%
some concerns about they're being stray
 
01:38:25.229 --> 01:38:25.239 align:start position:0%
animals and if you st a stray cat what
 
01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
what would happen and that scenario I I
 
01:38:30.430 --> 01:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate that one they would be no
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
victim of of the crime so I'm not sure
 
01:38:35.229 --> 01:38:35.239 align:start position:0%
who would be reporting it but even with
 
01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
that being said when you see I think
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
it's common to assume when you see a dog
 
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
or a cat that's not always a stray that
 
01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
someone may have some property rights
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
interest in that dogs are cats may not
 
01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a tag on it to know who
 
01:38:51.589 --> 01:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
the property owner is but I don't I
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
don't think when you see an animal you
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
simply assume it's a straight animal I
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
think we have a it's common that DS and
 
01:38:59.589 --> 01:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
daughters are both domesticated animal
 
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
so again this is just simply putting
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
them in in the same category and I feel
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
that from a property rights perspective
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
they should be on equal now equal field
 
01:39:11.709 --> 01:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
now when I had the incident happen
 
01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
myself I did it was clearly not going to
 
01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
be done in a way to actually find hit
 
01:39:18.109 --> 01:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
the anal that was not going to ever
 
01:39:20.109 --> 01:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
happen but the concern that I what I was
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
told was it wasn't crime there's no
 
01:39:24.310 --> 01:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
penalty for it there's no report to file
 
01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
nothing and even though I made the
 
01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
arable it's you know destruction of
 
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
property I own I own the animal someone
 
01:39:31.870 --> 01:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
destroyed the property they they're
 
01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
required to
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
stop the police that I spoke with they
 
01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
said that oh they understood what I was
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
saying but that's not how it's enforc I
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
know last year when I testified before
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
the committee that was a question that
 
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
was asked you know it's property damage
 
01:39:47.709 --> 01:39:47.719 align:start position:0%
and leaving the scene of property damage
 
01:39:50.350 --> 01:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
isn't already a law I agree with that
 
01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
but it's not the way it's being enforced
 
01:39:55.709 --> 01:39:55.719 align:start position:0%
I will say this exact bill was presented
 
01:39:57.589 --> 01:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
to this committee last term and it did
 
01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
pass 18 to1 uh and then in the house I
 
01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
it passed I believe on consent it might
 
01:40:07.229 --> 01:40:07.239 align:start position:0%
have passed it did actually uh made it
 
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
to the Senate but it was tabled in the
 
01:40:10.669 --> 01:40:10.679 align:start position:0%
Senate unfortunately due to the covid-19
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic and never had a hear so I would
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
ask I would ask the committee for their
 
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
I hope they would support a motion to Lo
 
01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.470 align:start position:0%
I hope they would support a motion to Lo
the

01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
task on on hb1 said before and I'll take
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
any questions okay thank you very much
 
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative any questions from the
 
01:40:29.550 --> 01:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
committee okay representative pataro um
 
01:40:32.350 --> 01:40:32.360 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman W and uh thank you
 
01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
representative abis for bringing this to
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
the committee um say if a dog is hit by
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
a driver and the driver follows the law
 
01:40:45.870 --> 01:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
and reports it would the owner of the
 
01:40:47.950 --> 01:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
dog if the dog is killed or needs
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
medical attention would the owner sue
 
01:40:53.070 --> 01:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question well I don't
 
01:40:56.430 --> 01:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
I I'm not going to assume what an owner
 
01:40:58.589 --> 01:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
would do I will say in regards to civil
 
01:41:00.189 --> 01:41:00.199 align:start position:0%
liability when I say civil liability I'm
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
not referring to the penalty for what
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
this bill would create which would be
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
$1,000 from a civil liability
 
01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
perspective I would believe that this
 
01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
has no impact on them if you're driving
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
in your vehicle and some anything runs
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
in front of your car animal person it
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
does not necessarily mean you're per se
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
negligent and therefore liable for that
 
01:41:24.109 --> 01:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
so I this does not create effect the
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
negligence liability even if this bill
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
were to fail if you were driving
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
recklessly or dangerously on your phone
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
or driving double to speed in order to
 
01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
strike someone's uh dog or cat for that
 
01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
matter I believe that you would have a
 
01:41:39.189 --> 01:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
you may be able to bring a negligence
 
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
claim obviously a destruction of
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
property CL you could you could bring
 
01:41:45.629 --> 01:41:45.639 align:start position:0%
that claim this has no impact thank you
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
much representative Aaron yes thank you
 
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
01:41:55.589 --> 01:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
Avis so my question is um your your
 
01:41:57.790 --> 01:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
language here says shall be guilty of a
 
01:42:00.109 --> 01:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
violation What kind of
 
01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
violation you don't specify any kind
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
of um specific
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
violation so the violation is it's it's
 
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
$1,000 is what the what the penalty
 
01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:13.270 align:start position:0%
$1,000 is what the what the penalty
would

01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:42:16.510 --> 01:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
be and that's the current penalty that
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:21.669 align:start position:0%
 
go

01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:42:23.229 --> 01:42:23.239 align:start position:0%
and and if you don't all you have to do
 
01:42:25.629 --> 01:42:25.639 align:start position:0%
is report it to the to the local
 
01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
authorities or you have to report to the
 
01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:28.830 align:start position:0%
authorities or you have to report to the
[Music]

01:42:28.830 --> 01:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:42:32.830 --> 01:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
owner so follow up follow quick followup
 
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so for instance uh if there was no
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
means of recording it or knowing that
 
01:42:41.950 --> 01:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
somebody has hit the animal there would
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
be no way to identify who the person is
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
that did the violation so it only have
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
to be something that was witnessed or
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
so the way this I
 
01:42:59.550 --> 01:42:59.560 align:start position:0%
mean if there there's nobody there to
 
01:43:01.709 --> 01:43:01.719 align:start position:0%
claim that you've hit the
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
animal how would you be guilty of this
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
violation if I ask for clarification you
 
01:43:10.510 --> 01:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
asking about the enforceability of this
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so I will say in circumstance I had
 
01:43:16.629 --> 01:43:16.639 align:start position:0%
I knew very well there was no way this
 
01:43:18.589 --> 01:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
this law would not not have impacted
 
01:43:19.950 --> 01:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
what would have happened in my situation
 
01:43:22.189 --> 01:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
because there was no way to know who the
 
01:43:24.149 --> 01:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
driver was no one saw it no one was
 
01:43:27.669 --> 01:43:27.679 align:start position:0%
there it you just see the the results so
 
01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
what happens though I mean that's a
 
01:43:31.830 --> 01:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
concern with enforceability but that
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
concern exists with the dog as well I
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
mean I'm saying is if I you strike a dog
 
01:43:39.870 --> 01:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
and and no one sees it and you drive
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
away who who's going to how are they
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
going to know it was you I will point
 
01:43:46.510 --> 01:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
out that a lot of the surveillance
 
01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
systems on a lot of homes that the cost
 
01:43:51.390 --> 01:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
of that is much becoming less less
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
expensive so I I I do believe in the
 
01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719 align:start position:0%
point in time this actually just even if
 
01:43:57.629 --> 01:43:57.639 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't pass it's the
 
01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
enforceability regarding dogs will
 
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
become a lot easier but that is that is
 
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
a concern that I have with but I I don't
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
this won't address that or solve that
 
01:44:08.589 --> 01:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
problem thank
 
01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
Ankerberg yes thank you uh Mr chairman
 
01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you um representative of for
 
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
joining us this morning um on line one
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
um says this subdivision shall be known
 
01:44:27.070 --> 01:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
as Arrow's law um who is
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
Arrow what v may take a while but I
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
don't mind that was that was my house
 
01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:35.679 align:start position:0%
short version please that was that was
 
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
my house pet and uh when this happened
 
01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh when I was on the phone with law uh
 
01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:41.589 align:start position:0%
uh when I was on the phone with law uh
law

01:44:41.589 --> 01:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement debating about whether the
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
current law would allow for report it
 
01:44:48.350 --> 01:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
was recommended that I contact my state
 
01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
representative I didn't
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
which I it wasn't meant in any ordinary
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
way but I don't believe they knew I was
 
01:44:56.550 --> 01:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
already a state
 
01:45:00.270 --> 01:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
representative so and this was something
 
01:45:02.430 --> 01:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
that was very more traumatic on my my
 
01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
wife than myself because I actually
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
wasn't home when it happened and uh she
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
is my con my concerned constituent so I
 
01:45:12.990 --> 01:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
am fing this on behalf of a very close
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
constituent of mine and that was the
 
01:45:18.189 --> 01:45:18.199 align:start position:0%
name of our our our cat that was struck
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
on a dead end street where the dri
 
01:45:22.830 --> 01:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
decided not to stop any totally not
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
locking at your cat just lock comment
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
involuntarily good all right I see no
 
01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:32.719 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
thanks representative
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
abis and actually we have thank
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
you nobody else signed up but I do have
 
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:53.310 align:start position:0%
 
Oregan

01:45:53.310 --> 01:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very very much Mr chair
 
01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
so I was U I just wanted to uh underline
 
01:46:03.189 --> 01:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to like uh first of all
 
01:46:05.070 --> 01:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
agree with everything R ABA said about
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
the importance of this bill so people
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
are very uh the bond between cats and
 
01:46:12.990 --> 01:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
humans is a very uh very close one um
 
01:46:14.470 --> 01:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
even when you're not the official owner
 
01:46:18.189 --> 01:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
of the cat and actually uh and actually
 
01:46:20.589 --> 01:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
cats probably think they own us but that
 
01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
still probably makes even more important
 
01:46:26.430 --> 01:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
that uh we like uh try toh take care of
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
them when they're when they're injured
 
01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
or when they die so that um I I was on
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
um I had a incident where driver I live
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
on a my Road's not a dead end Road it's
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
actually a fairly well-trafficked Road
 
01:46:41.070 --> 01:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
it's a detour around Main Street so I
 
01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
had um I came home one day and there was
 
01:46:47.229 --> 01:46:47.239 align:start position:0%
a uh there's like a dead cat like
 
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
actually fairly neatly laid out on a
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
towel with an apologetic an anonymous
 
01:46:52.510 --> 01:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
note and that was probably the person
 
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
who who ran them over and they obviously
 
01:46:57.070 --> 01:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
felt bad it was actually my next door
 
01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
neighbor's cat and he's uh he broke down
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
in tears he's usually a pretty uh stoic
 
01:47:05.229 --> 01:47:05.239 align:start position:0%
but cheerful guy not the typers usually
 
01:47:06.750 --> 01:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
breaks down in tears but he broke down
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
in tears over that and um so I think
 
01:47:13.589 --> 01:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
this is a so and also like also think
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
passing it now with this time um usually
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
with bills like this
 
01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
or less importance we're usually putting
 
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
them off to later but I think this one
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
is especially important just because of
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
a you know Silly incident that happen in
 
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
another committee with a chair probably
 
01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:29.679 align:start position:0%
not dealing with as graciously as you
 
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
are and um so I think we probably do
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
probably do want to underline that uh
 
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
everybody in Hampshire house values our
 
01:47:41.550 --> 01:47:41.560 align:start position:0%
values our feline companions so um so
 
01:47:43.629 --> 01:47:43.639 align:start position:0%
that I think we should uh think it's
 
01:47:45.310 --> 01:47:45.320 align:start position:0%
good bill we should pass it in terms of
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh determining who if you don't know who
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
the cat belongs to and actually cats
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
probably Escape run around and escape
 
01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
and get hit by cars more than dogs do um
 
01:47:57.070 --> 01:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
many cats are are microchips we can
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
actually determine at least who the uh
 
01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
previous uh quote andquot owner of the
 
01:48:05.709 --> 01:48:05.719 align:start position:0%
cat was so I so I I would uh I think
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
this is a I think I think dogs should be
 
01:48:09.310 --> 01:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
treated in this area the law on equal
 
01:48:12.189 --> 01:48:12.199 align:start position:0%
footing with with cats um and um so I
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
urge you to find the bill ought to pass
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
and hopefully uh hopefully we can get it
 
01:48:19.149 --> 01:48:19.159 align:start position:0%
done in a hopefully we can get this done
 
01:48:22.270 --> 01:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
in in Fe a few weeks when we actually uh
 
01:48:25.950 --> 01:48:25.960 align:start position:0%

much sir
 
01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
committee okay put this in an
 
01:56:57.069 --> 01:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
interesting situation not when you see
 
01:56:58.109 --> 01:56:58.119 align:start position:0%
all the
 
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
have people signed up to speak uh in
 
01:57:09.709 --> 01:57:09.719 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill um
 
01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
actually no only one to speak unless we
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:20.990 --> 01:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
up so a question for the speaker um
 
01:57:24.589 --> 01:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
something like this is the bill even um
 
01:57:26.229 --> 01:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
presented to the committee yeah well
 
01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
just let me explain um if if he could
 
01:57:31.229 --> 01:57:31.239 align:start position:0%
have he would have withdrawn it if it
 
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
was before the bill was given to the
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
committee once we take possession of it
 
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's no longer his bill it's our bill so
 
01:57:40.350 --> 01:57:40.360 align:start position:0%
essentially he's asking us to withdraw a
 
01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
forum is what it boils down to so uh
 
01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
again you don't see this too often but
 
01:57:46.910 --> 01:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
it does happen I've actually done it
 
01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
before myself in the past um I will not
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
and cannot deny anybody their right to
 
01:57:54.669 --> 01:57:54.679 align:start position:0%
speak uh to the bill either way I guess
 
01:57:56.350 --> 01:57:56.360 align:start position:0%
all I'm trying to say is that you
 
01:57:59.229 --> 01:57:59.239 align:start position:0%
probably don't have to um so that being
 
01:58:02.069 --> 01:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
said I'll go through the uh the people
 
01:58:03.950 --> 01:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
that are signed up and see what they
 
01:58:06.069 --> 01:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
wish to
 
01:58:09.669 --> 01:58:09.679 align:start position:0%
do so I got the first Speaker lined up
 
01:58:11.350 --> 01:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
if you're ready it's yeah let me see
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
what I want to do
 
01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:17.149 align:start position:0%
what I want to do
here

01:58:17.149 --> 01:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:21.629 --> 01:58:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:30.669 --> 01:58:30.679 align:start position:0%
Cape hello thank you for allowing me to
 
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
speak and thank you for the job that y
 
01:58:35.790 --> 01:58:35.800 align:start position:0%
all do I am a constituent from
 
01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
Whitefield New Hampshire and I'm
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
speaking on my own behalf I want to say
 
01:58:41.550 --> 01:58:41.560 align:start position:0%
that viiking on the left side of the
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
street against traffic is one of the
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
most dangerous violations a bicyclist
 
01:58:48.270 --> 01:58:48.280 align:start position:0%
can make yet most people who ride that
 
01:58:50.069 --> 01:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
way actually believe they are safer
 
01:58:54.069 --> 01:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
facing traffic this is just not true
 
01:58:57.709 --> 01:58:57.719 align:start position:0%
bicycles and cyclists are should be
 
01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
treated the same as motorists because of
 
01:59:02.910 --> 01:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
the way in which traffic flows it
 
01:59:04.350 --> 01:59:04.360 align:start position:0%
prevents a
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
significant danger to cyclists to put
 
01:59:10.350 --> 01:59:10.360 align:start position:0%
them going against traffic as they are
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
outside of the visibility of cars more
 
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
often than not putting themselves in
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
more possibilities to get hurt they also
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
will not be able to see regulatory
 
01:59:24.629 --> 01:59:24.639 align:start position:0%
signage that um dictates how they should
 
01:59:26.669 --> 01:59:26.679 align:start position:0%
or should not be riding along the
 
01:59:29.069 --> 01:59:29.079 align:start position:0%
roadway streets are designed for a
 
01:59:32.870 --> 01:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
variety of users and most crashes that
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
occur are
 
01:59:39.390 --> 01:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
from uh accidents where the cyclist is
 
01:59:41.470 --> 01:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
facing as opposed to the cyclist being
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
struck from behind is a significant
 
01:59:47.109 --> 01:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
difference where 90% of caride
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
collisions are caused by conditions or
 
01:59:51.550 --> 01:59:51.560 align:start position:0%
in front of the cyclist whereas only
 
01:59:54.709 --> 01:59:54.719 align:start position:0%
four to 6% of all car bike crashes
 
01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
involve a motor striking a non- swerving
 
01:59:58.990 --> 01:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
Cy list from
 
02:00:01.790 --> 02:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
behind so thank you so much for your
 
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
time I just wanted to make sure that we
 
02:00:07.310 --> 02:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
are keeping the mind like the core part
 
02:00:09.750 --> 02:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
of Transportation policy which is moving
 
02:00:12.750 --> 02:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
people from point A to point B as safely
 
02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
as possible in mind as we consider this
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you so much and I'm willing
 
02:00:20.589 --> 02:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you sir um
 
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
any questions for Mr Cape from the
 
02:00:28.350 --> 02:00:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
sir um we have one other hand up that's
 
02:00:36.430 --> 02:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
not on the sheet so it's a late
 
02:00:40.350 --> 02:00:40.360 align:start position:0%
speaker um I one other one after this of
 
02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:43.750 align:start position:0%
speaker um I one other one after this of
Representative

02:00:43.750 --> 02:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
Horgan um thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
02:00:48.430 --> 02:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
I I tried to sign on the sheet but I
 
02:00:50.069 --> 02:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
must have uh missed the deadline so
 
02:00:52.589 --> 02:00:52.599 align:start position:0%
resident Timothy Oregon I continue to
 
02:00:54.669 --> 02:00:54.679 align:start position:0%
represent straford County District Six
 
02:00:57.669 --> 02:00:57.679 align:start position:0%
the towns of Durham and Madbury and
 
02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
um I the uh in course B we have a durum
 
02:01:04.830 --> 02:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
we have bicycle Lanes all over town and
 
02:01:07.589 --> 02:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
the leading citizen actually was held
 
02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
while using the bicycle Lanes back um
 
02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:11.830 align:start position:0%
while using the bicycle Lanes back um
201

02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
201
 
02:01:16.189 --> 02:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
2014 I believe it was uh back um one of
 
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
my best friends but he was um he was
 
02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
going the uh he was going with traffic
 
02:01:22.069 --> 02:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
and and hit a door but that incident
 
02:01:24.669 --> 02:01:24.679 align:start position:0%
would have been just as bad if if uh
 
02:01:26.830 --> 02:01:26.840 align:start position:0%
he'd been uh traveling on the left side
 
02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
of the road so um motor bicycles are
 
02:01:33.870 --> 02:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles um they uh if we if we force
 
02:01:35.149 --> 02:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
them all the drive the left side of the
 
02:01:36.910 --> 02:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
road they would then be having head-on
 
02:01:39.109 --> 02:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
collisions with you know various other
 
02:01:40.910 --> 02:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
things that go slowly off to the side of
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
the road horses uh horses um horses farm
 
02:01:48.790 --> 02:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
equipment uh you know people on whatever
 
02:01:51.629 --> 02:01:51.639 align:start position:0%
like Segways or or motor scooters or
 
02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
there all kinds of things that move
 
02:01:55.149 --> 02:01:55.159 align:start position:0%
slowly that go off to the side of the
 
02:01:58.510 --> 02:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
road so that's just I think this is a
 
02:02:00.430 --> 02:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
very uh I think this is a very ill
 
02:02:03.149 --> 02:02:03.159 align:start position:0%
intent very silly Bill the one piece of
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
information I have to add specifically
 
02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
to it is that U this was a long time ago
 
02:02:12.229 --> 02:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
but I did a uh I I wrote up I wrote up a
 
02:02:13.870 --> 02:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
number of Articles and put them on a
 
02:02:17.310 --> 02:02:17.320 align:start position:0%
website about uh educational testing and
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that
 
02:02:21.310 --> 02:02:21.320 align:start position:0%
uh third graders had the hardest time
 
02:02:25.069 --> 02:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
with was which side of the uh road to uh
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
to to ride on and that was because they
 
02:02:28.750 --> 02:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
were trying to teach them that they
 
02:02:32.350 --> 02:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
should write on the left um which is U
 
02:02:34.189 --> 02:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
which I guess basically is a theory that
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
you tell people that they're supposed to
 
02:02:39.189 --> 02:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
walk on the left side of the road facing
 
02:02:41.069 --> 02:02:41.079 align:start position:0%
traffic because a pedestrian is not a
 
02:02:43.390 --> 02:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle and actually though 56 of the
 
02:02:44.709 --> 02:02:44.719 align:start position:0%
kids didn't know enough to give the
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
answer they expected to give which was
 
02:02:49.270 --> 02:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
the right on the left which apparently
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
was in the curriculum and that test was
 
02:02:53.229 --> 02:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
very long time ago all the third graders
 
02:02:55.270 --> 02:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
that took the test are now like uh
 
02:02:56.990 --> 02:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
people in their late 20s some of them
 
02:02:58.270 --> 02:02:58.280 align:start position:0%
may actually be serving in the
 
02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
legislature but um I don't know what the
 
02:03:03.550 --> 02:03:03.560 align:start position:0%
test says today but that was uh I think
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
this is just uh that's just bad advice
 
02:03:08.310 --> 02:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
to tell cyclist to write on the left
 
02:03:10.109 --> 02:03:10.119 align:start position:0%
especially especially when they're in
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
traffic and also even if forcing cyclist
 
02:03:17.149 --> 02:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
to drive on the left is a good idea this
 
02:03:19.069 --> 02:03:19.079 align:start position:0%
bill is silent on the issue what to do
 
02:03:21.270 --> 02:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
when you're on a one-way Street are you
 
02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to uh find a oneway street that
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
goes the wrong way so you're right into
 
02:03:28.229 --> 02:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
traffic or you supposed to are you
 
02:03:29.229 --> 02:03:29.239 align:start position:0%
supposed to
 
02:03:31.709 --> 02:03:31.719 align:start position:0%
like ride your bike on the left side of
 
02:03:33.910 --> 02:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
the oneway street or or what so you know
 
02:03:38.189 --> 02:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
it um you know it's so I so I think I
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
think this is a I think this is a bad
 
02:03:41.709 --> 02:03:41.719 align:start position:0%
Bill it should be killed on its own own
 
02:03:43.470 --> 02:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
merits and if anything we should have a
 
02:03:45.069 --> 02:03:45.079 align:start position:0%
law saying the bicyclists are supposed
 
02:03:46.830 --> 02:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
to ride on the right side of the road
 
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
along with the other vehicles so that's
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh that's uh probably more than you need
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
that's probably that's probably like all
 
02:03:56.069 --> 02:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
I have to say which is probably more
 
02:03:59.149 --> 02:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
than enough so I think U even though
 
02:04:01.470 --> 02:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor wants to withdraw it I
 
02:04:03.470 --> 02:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
think this is something that shouldn't
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
be itl this this year and it should be
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
it in the future session if it comes up
 
02:04:10.549 --> 02:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
again so that's thank you very much I
 
02:04:12.430 --> 02:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any testimony I'd
 
02:04:14.109 --> 02:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions but if
 
02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
probably thanks
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Horgan any
 
02:04:22.589 --> 02:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
02:04:24.629 --> 02:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you
 
02:04:24.639 --> 02:04:26.950 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you
again

02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
thanks um next up William Lambert from
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation who is
 
02:04:36.270 --> 02:04:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:52.750 align:start position:0%
 
Lambert

02:04:52.750 --> 02:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:57.589 --> 02:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:59.790 --> 02:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
unmute Mr lamber are you still there you
 
02:05:11.189 --> 02:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:13.870 --> 02:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
unmute all right I I have it now can you
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
hear me we got you now good all right
 
02:05:18.790 --> 02:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
I'm on a different computer I'm sorry um
 
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
I have submitted written testimonies do
 
02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
you have that uh available so I'm here
 
02:05:24.870 --> 02:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
seeing some set head noots so I won't
 
02:05:27.229 --> 02:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
fill your time with it I'll essentially
 
02:05:28.430 --> 02:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
um tell you that the Department of
 
02:05:30.430 --> 02:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation is opposed to the bill
 
02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
and I would point out as uh
 
02:05:35.709 --> 02:05:35.719 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan indicated um that
 
02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
there should be a lot that requires
 
02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
bikes to ride on the on the right side
 
02:05:40.510 --> 02:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
of the road I would note that there is
 
02:05:43.870 --> 02:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
um this bill proposed to change RSA
 
02:05:45.589 --> 02:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
26543 uh
 
02:05:48.030 --> 02:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
26544 is consistent with the uniform
 
02:05:50.030 --> 02:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle code and requiring PE a
 
02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
bicyclist to be on on the right side of
 
02:05:55.069 --> 02:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
the road um so with that uh I'd be happy
 
02:05:56.270 --> 02:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions but I would
 
02:05:59.149 --> 02:05:59.159 align:start position:0%
agree with representative hor Oregon um
 
02:06:02.589 --> 02:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
that the bill should be um ited on its
 
02:06:04.750 --> 02:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
own merits this session in any future
 
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
sessions and with that I would uh
 
02:06:09.390 --> 02:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
welcome any questions thank you sir any
 
02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.709 --> 02:06:17.719 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you again
 
02:06:19.310 --> 02:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
sir thank you
 
02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:28.510 --> 02:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
um that does it and the people that they
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
were signed up to testify in
 
02:06:32.910 --> 02:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
advance I don't see anybody that has
 
02:06:34.430 --> 02:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
signed up
 
02:06:36.830 --> 02:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
for since
 
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
then we run you got one hand up Katie
 
02:06:43.229 --> 02:06:43.239 align:start position:0%
lamb that's a new one
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
um Katie lamb can you hear us oh she
 
02:06:49.950 --> 02:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
just went back down no no hand up
 
02:06:52.109 --> 02:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
oh now she's up again here we go now
 
02:06:52.119 --> 02:06:53.310 align:start position:0%
oh now she's up again here we go now
we're

02:06:53.310 --> 02:06:53.320 align:start position:0%
we're
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
good thank you sorry I I preemptively
 
02:06:58.990 --> 02:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
put my hand down um I thought I had
 
02:07:00.990 --> 02:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
signed up in time but um this is my
 
02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
first time ever ever calling in or
 
02:07:05.470 --> 02:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
testifying so I must have done it wrong
 
02:07:08.109 --> 02:07:08.119 align:start position:0%
um but I would agree with uh the others
 
02:07:10.910 --> 02:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
spoke before me um in opposing this bill
 
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
it is significantly more dangerous for
 
02:07:17.189 --> 02:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
cyclists to ride against traffic um I
 
02:07:19.069 --> 02:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
would also advocate for
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh one requiring cyclist to ride on the
 
02:07:23.189 --> 02:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
right hand side I think there's kind of
 
02:07:25.549 --> 02:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
an ongoing confusion on on which side to
 
02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
ride so it's a potential to to set that
 
02:07:33.950 --> 02:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
in stone um finally but um yeah some of
 
02:07:35.950 --> 02:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
the safety concerns I have are are
 
02:07:39.069 --> 02:07:39.079 align:start position:0%
people turning out on side streets um
 
02:07:40.669 --> 02:07:40.679 align:start position:0%
they typically look left if they're
 
02:07:42.390 --> 02:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
going with traffic and not so much in
 
02:07:45.470 --> 02:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
right so that opens up the cyclist to uh
 
02:07:47.189 --> 02:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
potential collisions that they would not
 
02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
other otherwise be exposed to riding on

firsthand experience as a pedestrian
 
02:07:58.430 --> 02:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
with the way uh drivers can be dangerous

making um right side passing Maneuvers
 
02:08:04.750 --> 02:08:04.760 align:start position:0%

02:08:15.390 --> 02:08:15.400 align:start position:0%

House Bill
 
02:09:33.069 --> 02:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
268 hang tight for a minute uh because I
 
02:09:34.549 --> 02:09:34.559 align:start position:0%
think with the time we have left we're
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
going to take uh advantage of it and
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
exec this bill um right now or give us a
 
02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:43.189 align:start position:0%
exec this bill um right now or give us a
few

02:09:43.189 --> 02:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
few
 
02:09:45.830 --> 02:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
minutes the one we just did uh it
 
02:09:48.870 --> 02:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen often um but the the
 
02:09:51.629 --> 02:09:51.639 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor is asking us to itl it the
 
02:09:53.069 --> 02:09:53.079 align:start position:0%
few times I have seen it I have never
 
02:09:55.830 --> 02:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
seen a committee go against his their
 
02:09:58.830 --> 02:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
wishes so I think this is a simple one I
 
02:10:00.109 --> 02:10:00.119 align:start position:0%
think this will get us off the ground
 
02:10:01.870 --> 02:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
and get us warmed up for our work this
 
02:10:03.790 --> 02:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
afternoon unless I hear of any
 
02:10:06.669 --> 02:10:06.679 align:start position:0%
objections that's what I like to do just
 
02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:17.239 --> 02:11:42.750 align:start position:0%

03:53:17.670 --> 03:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
I watched somebody give a great big yawn
 
03:53:20.349 --> 03:53:20.359 align:start position:0%
the other day on U and I don't think
 
03:53:22.149 --> 03:53:22.159 align:start position:0%
they realized that their screen that
 
03:53:23.790 --> 03:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
their video was
 
03:53:27.149 --> 03:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
on um it would have been suitable for a
 
03:53:29.469 --> 03:53:29.479 align:start position:0%
dentist to be able to check
 
03:53:32.110 --> 03:53:32.120 align:start position:0%
someone's um fillings I think it was
 
03:53:37.950 --> 03:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:37.960 --> 03:53:41.469 align:start position:0%
 
yawn

03:53:41.469 --> 03:53:41.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:43.830 --> 03:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
do you know what time ex uh EXA session
 
03:53:46.309 --> 03:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
starts 2:15 is that
 
03:53:46.319 --> 03:54:07.870 align:start position:0%
starts 2:15 is that
right

03:54:07.870 --> 03:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:07.880 --> 03:55:07.389 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:55:07.389 --> 03:55:07.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:12.510 --> 03:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.800 --> 03:55:43.550 align:start position:0%
 
cleaver

03:55:43.550 --> 03:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:46.469 --> 03:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
anyone getting snow where they
 
03:55:50.429 --> 03:55:50.439 align:start position:0%
are we had some this morning but it
 
03:55:52.550 --> 03:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
stopped doesn't look like it's quite
 
03:55:55.469 --> 03:55:55.479 align:start position:0%
stopped here got I don't know 34 inches
 
03:55:58.070 --> 03:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:00.189 --> 03:56:00.199 align:start position:0%
surprise they said there wouldn't be
 
03:56:02.830 --> 03:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
much but over the next week or so it'll
 
03:56:07.030 --> 03:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
add up to uh significant amount I
 
03:56:09.429 --> 03:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
guess I heard this morning though there
 
03:56:12.910 --> 03:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
may be a Sunday afternoon little
 
03:56:15.429 --> 03:56:15.439 align:start position:0%
surprise not to do with the Super Bowl
 
03:56:19.990 --> 03:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:24.229 --> 03:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
boy anybody tired of winter
 
03:56:27.469 --> 03:56:27.479 align:start position:0%
yet you're a New Englander come
 
03:56:31.670 --> 03:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
on yeah my whole life but it I find that
 
03:56:34.990 --> 03:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
as I get a little older I guess less
 
03:56:38.110 --> 03:56:38.120 align:start position:0%
tolerant for clearing up the snow
 
03:56:41.149 --> 03:56:41.159 align:start position:0%
afterwards cold hands cold
 
03:56:43.710 --> 03:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
feet how do you suppose the folks in
 
03:56:48.110 --> 03:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
Buffalo do it uh it must just get just
 
03:56:49.830 --> 03:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
get ridiculous when you have to roof
 
03:56:53.349 --> 03:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
rake and shovel a walk every day for
 
03:56:56.309 --> 03:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
months I I don't know why they that's
 
03:56:59.590 --> 03:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:03.070 --> 03:57:03.080 align:start position:0%
suicide yeah it's interesting I don't
 
03:57:05.750 --> 03:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
know I've never known anyone from that
 
03:57:08.149 --> 03:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
lives in Buffalo that has to do it to
 
03:57:10.710 --> 03:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
find out how they do it
 
03:57:13.830 --> 03:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
but every night it's six or seven inches
 
03:57:16.389 --> 03:57:16.399 align:start position:0%
I think yeah when I was in Puerto Rico
 
03:57:20.510 --> 03:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
for the Red Cross a couple years ago um
 
03:57:22.830 --> 03:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
you know working in logistics one of the
 
03:57:26.309 --> 03:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
kids kid he was probably 30 compared to
 
03:57:30.710 --> 03:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
my nearly 70 um he was from Buffalo and
 
03:57:32.790 --> 03:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
I asked him that very question actually
 
03:57:35.630 --> 03:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
and he said no it's no big
 
03:57:40.229 --> 03:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
deal okay yeah maybe
 
03:57:42.670 --> 03:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
30 have you seen the piles when they get
 
03:57:44.389 --> 03:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
the Lakeside
 
03:57:50.389 --> 03:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:53.830 --> 03:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
crazy hi guys looks
 
03:57:57.590 --> 03:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
like chman has been delayed in the
 
03:58:01.189 --> 03:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
speaker I will officially
 
03:58:05.389 --> 03:58:05.399 align:start position:0%
open this afternoon s with house build
 
03:58:09.269 --> 03:58:09.279 align:start position:0%
224 relative to tinted windows on
 
03:58:12.550 --> 03:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
Vehicles excuse me chairman gagy Vice
 
03:58:14.750 --> 03:58:14.760 align:start position:0%

just no okay well how's
 
03:58:29.830 --> 03:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
this I think that might be better thank
 
03:58:34.269 --> 03:58:34.279 align:start position:0%
you okay I'll try to speak slowly
 
03:58:37.950 --> 03:58:37.960 align:start position:0%

speaking the prime sponsors
 
03:58:40.399 --> 03:58:42.389 align:start position:0%
speaking the prime sponsors
representative

03:58:42.389 --> 03:58:42.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:58:44.510 --> 03:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
yila are you
 
03:58:47.830 --> 03:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
there yep he's there now okay you put

his thing I
 
03:58:55.309 --> 03:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
got thank you Mr chairman or Mr Vice
 
03:58:57.670 --> 03:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh members of the
 
03:59:01.149 --> 03:59:01.159 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my uh name is
 
03:59:02.750 --> 03:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative Josh
 
03:59:07.429 --> 03:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
Oella and I represent uh Fremont
 
03:59:09.550 --> 03:59:09.560 align:start position:0%
Danville and
 
03:59:14.750 --> 03:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
wood and I am presenting to you today uh
 
03:59:20.149 --> 03:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
HB 224 relative to the win uh the
 
03:59:23.990 --> 03:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:27.950 --> 03:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
windows and uh this this is kind of a
 
03:59:30.950 --> 03:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
perennial issue that that comes
 
03:59:35.630 --> 03:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
back uh to this committee uh year and
 
03:59:40.630 --> 03:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
year again um uh this this proposal is
 
03:59:44.870 --> 03:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
is very similar to proposals in year P
 
03:59:50.030 --> 03:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
years past about the and uh there are
 
03:59:53.790 --> 03:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
obviously you know benefits to being
 
03:59:57.229 --> 03:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
able to Tin your tint your windows which
 
03:59:59.110 --> 03:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
is one of the reasons why we allow
 
04:00:03.990 --> 04:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
tinting on the rear uh windows and all
 
04:00:06.469 --> 04:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
this bill would do is to allow that same
 
04:00:08.830 --> 04:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
level of tint that is on the rear
 
04:00:13.590 --> 04:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
Windows to be on the front uh passenger
 
04:00:17.309 --> 04:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
and driver side windows also um it would
 
04:00:20.110 --> 04:00:20.120 align:start position:0%
bring us in line with
 
04:00:25.229 --> 04:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
the standards uh set in Massachusetts
 
04:00:25.239 --> 04:00:26.590 align:start position:0%
the standards uh set in Massachusetts
and

04:00:26.590 --> 04:00:26.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:28.990 --> 04:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
Maine uh at
 
04:00:31.910 --> 04:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
35% uh visible light transmission
 
04:00:34.110 --> 04:00:34.120 align:start position:0%
through the
 
04:00:34.120 --> 04:00:36.349 align:start position:0%
through the
window

04:00:36.349 --> 04:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
window
 
04:00:40.510 --> 04:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
and we have uh uh you know talked before
 
04:00:43.550 --> 04:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
in past sessions about the benefits some
 
04:00:44.710 --> 04:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
of which
 
04:00:49.110 --> 04:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
include um just decrease heat in the car
 
04:00:53.630 --> 04:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
and fading of the vehicle um health risk
 
04:00:57.910 --> 04:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
from UV rays uh reduced
 
04:01:00.269 --> 04:01:00.279 align:start position:0%
glare uh
 
04:01:02.990 --> 04:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
and last time I
 
04:01:06.670 --> 04:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
also uh a couple years ago I tried to
 
04:01:08.830 --> 04:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
quantify the danger
 
04:01:08.840 --> 04:01:10.550 align:start position:0%
quantify the danger
to

04:01:10.550 --> 04:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:01:14.910 --> 04:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
officers and I was not able to identify
 
04:01:17.990 --> 04:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
that there was any correlation between
 
04:01:20.990 --> 04:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
officer officer safety and
 
04:01:26.189 --> 04:01:26.199 align:start position:0%
tinting um and also in in that same vein
 
04:01:30.269 --> 04:01:30.279 align:start position:0%
because Maine and Massachusetts allow
 
04:01:32.710 --> 04:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
for this level of tinting on the front
 
04:01:35.309 --> 04:01:35.319 align:start position:0%
windows our officers already need to be
 
04:01:37.389 --> 04:01:37.399 align:start position:0%
trained on that and be able to handle
 
04:01:40.070 --> 04:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
that situation because people are always
 
04:01:44.269 --> 04:01:44.279 align:start position:0%
traveling um to New Hampshire for to
 
04:01:47.950 --> 04:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
take advantage of our uh tax-free New
 
04:01:51.910 --> 04:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Live Free or Die State
 
04:01:55.110 --> 04:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
um also there
 
04:01:57.790 --> 04:01:57.800 align:start position:0%
are New Hampshire kind of stands out as
 
04:02:02.189 --> 04:02:02.199 align:start position:0%
being one of the last few in the country
 
04:02:06.510 --> 04:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
to be not allowing any tint on the
 
04:02:09.229 --> 04:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
front uh drivers and passenger side
 
04:02:12.030 --> 04:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
windows there's only four states in the
 
04:02:14.790 --> 04:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
whole country that don't allow some
 
04:02:18.670 --> 04:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
aftermarket tinting on these windows
 
04:02:22.229 --> 04:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
and the trend over the last like 25
 
04:02:26.309 --> 04:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
years has been to move away from
 
04:02:29.149 --> 04:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
restricting this and
 
04:02:34.950 --> 04:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
even um I heard that they that uh the
 
04:02:38.309 --> 04:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
federal level has has uh looked into to
 
04:02:38.319 --> 04:02:39.030 align:start position:0%
federal level has has uh looked into to
it

04:02:39.030 --> 04:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:02:42.510 --> 04:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
for to allowing it for um and has
 
04:02:46.189 --> 04:02:46.199 align:start position:0%
allowed it for truck drivers to allow
 
04:02:49.510 --> 04:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
tinting because of the dangers to
 
04:02:57.189 --> 04:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
um to the UV and um other such uh
 
04:03:01.110 --> 04:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
benefits and uh right now New Hampshire
 
04:03:05.710 --> 04:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
does allow uh an exception
 
04:03:08.630 --> 04:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
for people that have a medical
 
04:03:11.349 --> 04:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
condition and that
 
04:03:14.149 --> 04:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
04:03:17.630 --> 04:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
an a complicated thing uh in my
 
04:03:20.269 --> 04:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
understanding to get and
 
04:03:24.710 --> 04:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
to to deal with because you kind of uh
 
04:03:26.910 --> 04:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
have a problem of what what if someone
 
04:03:29.670 --> 04:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
else is driving your car is that really
 
04:03:33.389 --> 04:03:33.399 align:start position:0%
allowed um and so it would just be
 
04:03:39.670 --> 04:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
simpler to allow this uh same level
 
04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
of of tint on on both the the rear and
 
04:03:47.110 --> 04:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
the the passenger and driver side
 
04:03:50.590 --> 04:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
windows and it also another thing to
 
04:03:54.149 --> 04:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
bring up is that when people are selling
 
04:03:56.389 --> 04:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
cars in between states there's always
 
04:03:59.030 --> 04:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
the issue of having it to have it need
 
04:04:00.389 --> 04:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:04:03.590 --> 04:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
removed um and or added back on if it's
 
04:04:06.510 --> 04:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
registered in another state it also um
 
04:04:09.590 --> 04:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
incentivizes people to to try to
 
04:04:11.670 --> 04:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
register their vehicle in another state
 
04:04:13.309 --> 04:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
so that they wouldn't be subject to our
 
04:04:15.990 --> 04:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
rules regarding this especially for
 
04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
people that it may affect them but maybe
 
04:04:20.950 --> 04:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
not to the level that a doctor would
 
04:04:24.309 --> 04:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
allow them to the exception and so it's
 
04:04:26.110 --> 04:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
just some things
 
04:04:28.870 --> 04:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
that um are very important to me and
 
04:04:30.710 --> 04:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm bringing this bill back
 
04:04:33.750 --> 04:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
and I hope you all uh support this bill
 
04:04:35.389 --> 04:04:35.399 align:start position:0%
and I will answer any
 
04:04:38.670 --> 04:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you

thank you representative yella for
 
04:05:03.590 --> 04:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question um as you know your
 
04:05:07.630 --> 04:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
bill last term um this committee worked
 
04:05:09.990 --> 04:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
very very hard on it uh took it to a
 
04:05:12.870 --> 04:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
work session had lots of presentations
 
04:05:16.070 --> 04:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
about the different um percentages of
 
04:05:18.630 --> 04:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
light transmission and tint and
 
04:05:20.750 --> 04:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately um with an amendment by
 
04:05:22.910 --> 04:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative Stephen Smith we amended
 
04:05:26.910 --> 04:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
your bill um to
 
04:05:30.070 --> 04:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
specify that the light
 
04:05:33.189 --> 04:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
transmittance would not be less than 70%
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
because there was a big discussion of is
 
04:05:38.550 --> 04:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
it 70% is it 30% how do you quantify By
 
04:05:41.269 --> 04:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
the Light um that line was in would have
 
04:05:44.269 --> 04:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
been put into line 18 of the bill before
 
04:05:47.189 --> 04:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
us today um can you please explain to me
 
04:05:50.710 --> 04:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
why you did not file the bill as we
 
04:05:55.469 --> 04:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:00.550 --> 04:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
term yes thank you for the the question
 
04:06:04.590 --> 04:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
I I plan to and
 
04:06:07.870 --> 04:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
I was talking to some of the the people
 
04:06:12.189 --> 04:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
people that um are in this industry and
 
04:06:15.229 --> 04:06:15.239 align:start position:0%
they wanted to come back and make the
 
04:06:18.830 --> 04:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
case again for this they thought that
 
04:06:22.990 --> 04:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
the 70% was um I think it there might
 
04:06:24.710 --> 04:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
have been some confusion on whether or
 
04:06:28.469 --> 04:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
not it was um if you're saying that
 
04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
whether you're quantifying how much
 
04:06:32.469 --> 04:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
light can get through or how much light
 
04:06:35.950 --> 04:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
is blocked but I think there was a
 
04:06:39.389 --> 04:06:39.399 align:start position:0%
sentiment that uh well from the the
 
04:06:41.790 --> 04:06:41.800 align:start position:0%
people in the industry that I talked to
 
04:06:44.429 --> 04:06:44.439 align:start position:0%
that they didn't actually come to the
 
04:06:46.510 --> 04:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
hearing or they wanted to make this case
 
04:06:51.269 --> 04:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
again to the committee and um I know for
 
04:06:54.389 --> 04:06:54.399 align:start position:0%
for a fact that one of the people uh was
 
04:06:56.030 --> 04:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
not able to make it today I'm not sure
 
04:07:00.910 --> 04:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
if they sent in um uh testimony remote
 
04:07:03.229 --> 04:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
or like uh via email or something but
 
04:07:05.269 --> 04:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
they wanted to make the case again is is
 
04:07:08.149 --> 04:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
the reason why and I'm not against uh an
 
04:07:11.710 --> 04:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
amendment to change it back if if uh
 
04:07:14.970 --> 04:07:14.980 align:start position:0%
their case is not sufficient to the
 
04:07:14.980 --> 04:07:17.189 align:start position:0%
their case is not sufficient to the
[Music]

04:07:17.189 --> 04:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:07:17.199 --> 04:07:18.750 align:start position:0%
[Music]
committee

04:07:18.750 --> 04:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:07:21.269 --> 04:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
followup yes go
 
04:07:25.389 --> 04:07:25.399 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you um when you say people
 
04:07:28.269 --> 04:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
in the industry do you mean uh car the
 
04:07:29.870 --> 04:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
car industry like the people who would
 
04:07:31.149 --> 04:07:31.159 align:start position:0%
apply this
 
04:07:34.269 --> 04:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
tent yes the people that would apply it
 
04:07:37.030 --> 04:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
that have much more experience in you
 
04:07:38.990 --> 04:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
know what
 
04:07:40.950 --> 04:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
this the
 
04:07:44.349 --> 04:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
um how dark it is how much tint is
 
04:07:46.910 --> 04:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
already on the vehicles it seemed to me
 
04:07:48.990 --> 04:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
that when they were saying the reason
 
04:07:52.189 --> 04:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
why they had the issue was that um if it
 
04:07:54.950 --> 04:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
was changed uh to
 
04:07:58.109 --> 04:07:58.119 align:start position:0%
70 I I think they believe that it was
 
04:08:01.830 --> 04:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
still going to be um light transmit
 
04:08:04.950 --> 04:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
transmission through and not you know
 
04:08:07.990 --> 04:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
how much is blocked and so they said
 
04:08:13.309 --> 04:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
that 70% was essentially what comes
 
04:08:16.070 --> 04:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
Factory and so there would not be any
 
04:08:18.870 --> 04:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
option for adding any additional tint
 
04:08:22.349 --> 04:08:22.359 align:start position:0%
aftermarket tint and so it was just a a
 
04:08:25.030 --> 04:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
discussion that we had from people in
 
04:08:26.950 --> 04:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
that that industry that apply the tint
 
04:08:30.149 --> 04:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
yes and so I offered to put the same
 
04:08:31.710 --> 04:08:31.720 align:start position:0%
bill in and then they can make the case
 
04:08:35.189 --> 04:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
and if if the committee is still
 
04:08:37.950 --> 04:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
unconvinced by their arguments then then
 
04:08:40.910 --> 04:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
we can amend it right back thank you
 
04:08:42.790 --> 04:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
representative torski uh there's going
 
04:08:44.990 --> 04:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
to be someone testifying here from the
 
04:08:47.670 --> 04:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
international window film Association
 
04:08:49.790 --> 04:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps they can deal with your question
 
04:08:52.790 --> 04:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
in in a better
 
04:08:56.670 --> 04:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
manner thank you representative
 
04:09:00.389 --> 04:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
Sykes yes um thank you Mr chairman uh
 
04:09:02.229 --> 04:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
representative tki asked the very
 
04:09:04.870 --> 04:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
question that I intended to
 
04:09:08.510 --> 04:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
ask okay any other questions from the
 
04:09:11.389 --> 04:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
committee Greg Hill has his name up he
 
04:09:14.349 --> 04:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
does I don't see him okay representative
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
Hill thank you Mr chairman um and thank
 
04:09:20.149 --> 04:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
you uh representative for taking my call
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
I've never seen this bill before this is
 
04:09:25.630 --> 04:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
uh this is a great um addition to the
 
04:09:28.389 --> 04:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
transportation committee here um that
 
04:09:30.550 --> 04:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
was factious by the way for Mr
 
04:09:33.750 --> 04:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative syes um I have a question
 
04:09:35.109 --> 04:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
about line
 
04:09:38.670 --> 04:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
23 um I'm wondering
 
04:09:42.429 --> 04:09:42.439 align:start position:0%
why if your bill would pass we would
 
04:09:47.070 --> 04:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
still need the U medical reasoning for
 
04:09:55.870 --> 04:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:58.990 --> 04:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
permit um thank you for the
 
04:09:59.000 --> 04:10:02.510 align:start position:0%
permit um thank you for the
question

04:10:02.510 --> 04:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:09.109 --> 04:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
that that so I my understanding is that
 
04:10:09.119 --> 04:10:11.309 align:start position:0%
that that so I my understanding is that
it's

04:10:11.309 --> 04:10:11.319 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:10:15.870 --> 04:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
possible that it could be darker if you
 
04:10:15.880 --> 04:10:17.670 align:start position:0%
possible that it could be darker if you
needed

04:10:17.670 --> 04:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
needed
 
04:10:21.429 --> 04:10:21.439 align:start position:0%
um had a medical waiver but if it's not
 
04:10:24.309 --> 04:10:24.319 align:start position:0%
then there would be no reason to to have
 
04:10:29.389 --> 04:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:33.309 --> 04:10:33.319 align:start position:0%
allowance followup Please Mr chair
 
04:10:37.109 --> 04:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
Hardley um do you know if the and and
 
04:10:37.119 --> 04:10:37.990 align:start position:0%
Hardley um do you know if the and and
perhaps

04:10:37.990 --> 04:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
04:10:40.590 --> 04:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
U the chair would know um do you know if
 
04:10:43.950 --> 04:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
that line was included in the amendment
 
04:10:45.429 --> 04:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
that passed this
 
04:10:48.469 --> 04:10:48.479 align:start position:0%
committee um and pass the house I think
 
04:10:51.990 --> 04:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
um last year or is that a carry forward
 
04:10:55.070 --> 04:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:58.790 --> 04:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
year I honestly don't remember Mr chair
 
04:11:00.910 --> 04:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
can I speak to that real quick yes go
 
04:11:03.149 --> 04:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
ahead repesent of O'Hara might have um
 
04:11:05.710 --> 04:11:05.720 align:start position:0%
it looks like that they're striking out
 
04:11:09.070 --> 04:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
or window uh or the windows on the left
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
and right but leaving the windshield so
 
04:11:13.469 --> 04:11:13.479 align:start position:0%
that I think is what the medical the
 
04:11:15.070 --> 04:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
medical exception is for is for the
 
04:11:16.910 --> 04:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
windshield now and they're getting rid
 
04:11:19.189 --> 04:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
of the exception for the driver's side
 
04:11:20.630 --> 04:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
or passenger side since it would already
 
04:11:22.950 --> 04:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
be law that they could do that so it
 
04:11:24.630 --> 04:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
looks like that they're leaving that in
 
04:11:26.030 --> 04:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
there so they could do the windshield
 
04:11:28.229 --> 04:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
that they needed to for medical reasons
 
04:11:30.070 --> 04:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
did you all hear
 
04:11:34.710 --> 04:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
that yes okay um Mr chairman I could
 
04:11:38.670 --> 04:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
answer representative Hill's question
 
04:11:42.189 --> 04:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
go ahead the previous year's bill that
 
04:11:45.670 --> 04:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
we passed had the same language where
 
04:11:47.670 --> 04:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
the part of the medical exception was
 
04:11:47.680 --> 04:11:50.349 align:start position:0%
the part of the medical exception was
taken

04:11:50.349 --> 04:11:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:53.870 --> 04:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
away okay thank you representative syes
 
04:11:56.030 --> 04:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski has okay
 
04:11:58.309 --> 04:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski yeah I can see
 
04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:12:02.149 --> 04:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
representative yella for taking my
 
04:12:04.389 --> 04:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned medical
 
04:12:06.670 --> 04:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
conditions can you just kind of talk a
 
04:12:08.149 --> 04:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
little bit more about what type of
 
04:12:10.070 --> 04:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
medical conditions will
 
04:12:15.510 --> 04:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:19.349 --> 04:12:19.359 align:start position:0%
tent I believe
 
04:12:23.349 --> 04:12:23.359 align:start position:0%
so obviously I'm not a doctor so um I
 
04:12:26.189 --> 04:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily know the exact
 
04:12:30.910 --> 04:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
technical language for that but I think
 
04:12:34.950 --> 04:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
that you would want to or at least ask
 
04:12:38.830 --> 04:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
your your doctor your eye doctor whether
 
04:12:43.109 --> 04:12:43.119 align:start position:0%
if you had issues with glare if you um I
 
04:12:46.510 --> 04:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
know some my uh I know someone that has
 
04:12:48.950 --> 04:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
like Vitiligo and so they were losing
 
04:12:52.109 --> 04:12:52.119 align:start position:0%
their tint in their eyes and so it it
 
04:12:55.590 --> 04:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
was very hard to drive at night um
 
04:12:58.590 --> 04:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
because of that uh different different
 
04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
types of medical conditions obviously
 
04:13:03.389 --> 04:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
people that have a history or more
 
04:13:08.109 --> 04:13:08.119 align:start position:0%
susceptible to um skin cancer and stuff
 
04:13:09.510 --> 04:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
like that would
 
04:13:12.990 --> 04:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
be um I guess seeking it whether or not
 
04:13:15.229 --> 04:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
it's an allowed Thing by the doctor
 
04:13:17.229 --> 04:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
would be but those are the types of
 
04:13:19.670 --> 04:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
things I think that it would be um I
 
04:13:23.149 --> 04:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
would go to my doctor to to request uh
 
04:13:24.790 --> 04:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
an exception for thank you for the
 
04:13:28.349 --> 04:13:28.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative O'Hara
 
04:13:29.910 --> 04:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
H just thank you Mr chair just a quick
 
04:13:32.710 --> 04:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
question is so this tinting would be the
 
04:13:35.109 --> 04:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
same level that they allow uh as privacy
 
04:13:38.790 --> 04:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
tinting on SUVs for the back passenger
 
04:13:41.429 --> 04:13:41.439 align:start position:0%
windows in New Hampshire currently yes
 
04:13:44.790 --> 04:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank uh representative I
 
04:13:46.590 --> 04:13:46.600 align:start position:0%

states that border New Hampshire allow
 
04:13:58.630 --> 04:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
window tint and what levels they might
 
04:14:00.149 --> 04:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
have in
 
04:14:03.510 --> 04:14:03.520 align:start position:0%

that don't um both Massachusetts and
 
04:14:21.070 --> 04:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
Maine allow a 35% tint just like is um
 
04:14:26.830 --> 04:14:26.840 align:start position:0%

like to thank the committee uh for this
 
04:15:20.030 --> 04:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity I actually was kind of
 
04:15:24.030 --> 04:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
looking forward to my first uh Hearing
 
04:15:26.950 --> 04:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
in public ever but I guess that won't
 
04:15:30.269 --> 04:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
happen this year um thank you also to
 
04:15:32.670 --> 04:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
representative yella who is one of my
 
04:15:34.229 --> 04:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
representatives and the other sponsors
 
04:15:37.510 --> 04:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
of this bill um some of what
 
04:15:40.149 --> 04:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
will share today uh representative yella
 
04:15:43.590 --> 04:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
already covered but um I think it's fair
 
04:15:46.870 --> 04:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
to reiterate um as he said uh New
 
04:15:49.349 --> 04:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one of only four states in
 
04:15:51.630 --> 04:15:51.640 align:start position:0%
the nation which doesn't allow the
 
04:15:53.510 --> 04:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
driver and front passenger Windows to be
 
04:15:57.229 --> 04:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
tinted um of the 47 states that do allow
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
tint on those front windows 177% um
 
04:16:04.950 --> 04:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
allow the 35% that is in this bill um
 
04:16:10.189 --> 04:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
and uh 17 other states allow darker than
 
04:16:13.910 --> 04:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
35% on those windows um a lot of
 
04:16:16.550 --> 04:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
people probably think that uh window
 
04:16:18.670 --> 04:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
film is just about looking good or
 
04:16:22.030 --> 04:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
adding privacy um but as representative
 
04:16:25.630 --> 04:16:25.640 align:start position:0%
yokell uh stated that's not the case um
 
04:16:27.870 --> 04:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest benefits of window
 
04:16:30.750 --> 04:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
film is the UV protection it can offer
 
04:16:33.269 --> 04:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
um the American Academy of Dermatology
 
04:16:35.590 --> 04:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
states that skin cancer is the most
 
04:16:37.469 --> 04:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
common cancer in the US
 
04:16:39.429 --> 04:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
and that most melanoma cases are
 
04:16:41.830 --> 04:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
attributable to UV
 
04:16:44.309 --> 04:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
exposure melanoma cases have been
 
04:16:46.229 --> 04:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
consistently on the rise over the past
 
04:16:48.830 --> 04:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
few years the Skin Cancer Foundation
 
04:16:51.550 --> 04:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
estimates the number of melanoma cases
 
04:16:54.670 --> 04:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
this year will increase by
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
5.8% and the number of melanoma deaths
 
04:16:59.429 --> 04:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
will increase by
 
04:17:02.910 --> 04:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
4.8% uh Window Films can reduce the UV
 
04:17:05.389 --> 04:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
by up to
 
04:17:08.149 --> 04:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
99% um if you you've ever had to squint
 
04:17:10.269 --> 04:17:10.279 align:start position:0%
your eyes from the glare of the Sun or
 
04:17:11.950 --> 04:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
the brightness of the headlights in your
 
04:17:14.550 --> 04:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
side mirrors um you know that that can
 
04:17:17.109 --> 04:17:17.119 align:start position:0%
cause eye strain which can then cause
 
04:17:20.870 --> 04:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
driver fatigue so having window film um
 
04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
on those front windows can reduce the
 
04:17:26.710 --> 04:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
bright and Gless in your side uh side
 
04:17:28.990 --> 04:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
mirrors um that would make for safer
 
04:17:31.670 --> 04:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
drivers and safer roads in New
 
04:17:33.990 --> 04:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um from an environmental
 
04:17:36.510 --> 04:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
standpoint window film can reduce the
 
04:17:38.590 --> 04:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
need to use your automobile's cooling
 
04:17:41.189 --> 04:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
system by reducing the interior
 
04:17:44.830 --> 04:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
heat um that that would then reduce
 
04:17:47.429 --> 04:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
emissions um and it can also the film
 
04:17:49.429 --> 04:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
can also protect the interior from
 
04:17:51.990 --> 04:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
fading and cracking extending the life
 
04:17:54.750 --> 04:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
and the value of a vehicle um I do work
 
04:17:56.790 --> 04:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
for a window film company in
 
04:17:59.030 --> 04:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh one of my favorite
 
04:18:01.429 --> 04:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
testimonials was from a customer whose
 
04:18:04.710 --> 04:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
tinted window had been broken by a rock
 
04:18:07.790 --> 04:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
um although the glass did shatter the
 
04:18:11.429 --> 04:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
film had held together the thousands of
 
04:18:14.990 --> 04:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
pieces of glass so they did not uh
 
04:18:17.109 --> 04:18:17.119 align:start position:0%
spread all over the vehicle so that is
 
04:18:19.950 --> 04:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
there is a very valid benefit to window
 
04:18:21.070 --> 04:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
film with
 
04:18:23.830 --> 04:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
that um all of these great benefits are
 
04:18:25.830 --> 04:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
offered to passengers in the rear of a
 
04:18:28.149 --> 04:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire vehicle however in the
 
04:18:30.630 --> 04:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
area of the car that is always occupied
 
04:18:33.030 --> 04:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
which is the driver's seat those Riders
 
04:18:35.830 --> 04:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
are denied these benefits so as a health
 
04:18:38.309 --> 04:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
and safety concern concern I would think
 
04:18:41.229 --> 04:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
that um you would want the thousands of
 
04:18:43.070 --> 04:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
drivers and front seat passengers
 
04:18:44.550 --> 04:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
traveling in their vehicles in New
 
04:18:47.590 --> 04:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire every day to also have these
 
04:18:50.229 --> 04:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
protections um as I mentioned I work for
 
04:18:52.990 --> 04:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
a window film company in Massachusetts
 
04:18:55.109 --> 04:18:55.119 align:start position:0%
all of our employees actually live in
 
04:18:58.109 --> 04:18:58.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we travel to Massachusetts
 
04:19:00.189 --> 04:19:00.199 align:start position:0%
every day to bring our services to their
 
04:19:02.349 --> 04:19:02.359 align:start position:0%
residents we would love to bring our
 
04:19:04.910 --> 04:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
business to the Granite State um this
 
04:19:07.229 --> 04:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
this legislation could offer Revenue
 
04:19:09.229 --> 04:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
stream for New
 
04:19:12.550 --> 04:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I also wanted to address a
 
04:19:14.990 --> 04:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
couple of things that were talked uh
 
04:19:18.910 --> 04:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
about previously um representative tersi
 
04:19:21.830 --> 04:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
asked about the 70% versus
 
04:19:24.229 --> 04:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
35% um I think one of
 
04:19:28.910 --> 04:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
the one of the biggest um benefits of
 
04:19:31.630 --> 04:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
leaving it at the 35% um as
 
04:19:33.550 --> 04:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
representative yella said that is what
 
04:19:36.469 --> 04:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
is allowed in Massachusetts and Maine so
 
04:19:38.750 --> 04:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
if if you're buying a vehicle or if you
 
04:19:41.309 --> 04:19:41.319 align:start position:0%
move from one of those States um to to
 
04:19:43.630 --> 04:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you would then be allowed
 
04:19:47.070 --> 04:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
to keep that film on your
 
04:19:51.229 --> 04:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
car um the other question that I oh um
 
04:19:53.229 --> 04:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
the factory ENT that's in the back of
 
04:19:55.469 --> 04:19:55.479 align:start position:0%
SUVs someone I'm sorry I don't remember
 
04:19:58.510 --> 04:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
which one of you asked about that but um
 
04:20:01.309 --> 04:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
that factory tint is usually darker than
 
04:20:04.510 --> 04:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
35 it's usually 20 or 25% light
 
04:20:07.070 --> 04:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
transmission so what we would um this
 
04:20:10.429 --> 04:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
bill this 35% would actually be lighter
 
04:20:13.109 --> 04:20:13.119 align:start position:0%
than what you see Factory tinted on the
 
04:20:14.750 --> 04:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
back of those
 
04:20:17.349 --> 04:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
vehicles um there was another question
 
04:20:20.189 --> 04:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
about the waiver and why the waiver
 
04:20:23.269 --> 04:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
would still be needed um I would offer
 
04:20:26.510 --> 04:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
two reasons for that um somebody did
 
04:20:29.030 --> 04:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
mention the windshield um the other
 
04:20:31.309 --> 04:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
reason to leave that in there is if you
 
04:20:34.349 --> 04:20:34.359 align:start position:0%
do decide to change the
 
04:20:38.590 --> 04:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
35% um then the waiver would
 
04:20:42.389 --> 04:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
allow would allow um darker than the 70
 
04:20:44.109 --> 04:20:44.119 align:start position:0%
if you if you change it back to the 70
 
04:20:46.269 --> 04:20:46.279 align:start position:0%
that you had passed last year uh the
 
04:20:48.149 --> 04:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
waiver would then allow a person with a
 
04:20:50.189 --> 04:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
medical condition to go ahead and get
 
04:20:53.670 --> 04:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
the 35 versus the
 
04:20:53.680 --> 04:20:55.550 align:start position:0%
the 35 versus the
70

04:20:55.550 --> 04:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
70
 
04:20:59.149 --> 04:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
um so I think that is it I appreciate
 
04:21:04.590 --> 04:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
the time that you have given me and um I
 
04:21:05.910 --> 04:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
don't know if you'll have any questions
 
04:21:07.269 --> 04:21:07.279 align:start position:0%
for me
 
04:21:10.309 --> 04:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
if not then uh have a wonderful
 
04:21:12.469 --> 04:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
afternoon anybody have any questions for
 
04:21:12.479 --> 04:21:13.349 align:start position:0%
afternoon anybody have any questions for
the

04:21:13.349 --> 04:21:13.359 align:start position:0%

better just a simple question I was
 
04:21:25.590 --> 04:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
asked I would like the witness to tell
 
04:21:27.990 --> 04:21:28.000 align:start position:0%

enberg thank you Mr chair um thank you

uh Miss cnut yes your your testimony
 
04:21:57.670 --> 04:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
today um I just had a question about the
 
04:22:00.389 --> 04:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
availability of the the manufactured
 
04:22:03.630 --> 04:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
aftermarket tint is is it widely
 
04:22:06.870 --> 04:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
available in only at the
 
04:22:06.880 --> 04:22:08.429 align:start position:0%
available in only at the
35%

04:22:08.429 --> 04:22:08.439 align:start position:0%
35%
 
04:22:11.030 --> 04:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
visibility is is that would that be
 
04:22:14.670 --> 04:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
considered a a manufacturer sort of uh
 
04:22:18.710 --> 04:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
common standard or is this level of tint
 
04:22:22.429 --> 04:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
available easily available um in a wide
 
04:22:25.309 --> 04:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
range of visibilities where where would
 
04:22:27.469 --> 04:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
where would that fall in your experience
 
04:22:27.479 --> 04:22:28.550 align:start position:0%
where would that fall in your experience
thank

04:22:28.550 --> 04:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:22:31.229 --> 04:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
you thank thank you for the question um
 
04:22:34.109 --> 04:22:34.119 align:start position:0%
so window films are available in many
 
04:22:37.670 --> 04:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
different shades um anyway from 5% that
 
04:22:40.429 --> 04:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
you see on the back of a limo um up to
 
04:22:42.950 --> 04:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know 80 or 90% which is almost
 
04:22:42.960 --> 04:22:44.630 align:start position:0%
you know 80 or 90% which is almost
essentially

04:22:44.630 --> 04:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
04:22:48.389 --> 04:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
clear um I think the 35% that um has
 
04:22:51.309 --> 04:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
been proposed in this bill is very
 
04:22:55.830 --> 04:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
common and um one of the most common
 
04:22:59.550 --> 04:22:59.560 align:start position:0%
um darknesses uh so to speak um that are
 
04:23:04.950 --> 04:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:07.469 --> 04:23:07.479 align:start position:0%
country repres Presa
 
04:23:10.070 --> 04:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
Hill thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:23:12.710 --> 04:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
very much for your uh informative
 
04:23:17.429 --> 04:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
testimony I um as I recall um in years
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
past it was actually the film itself
 
04:23:25.309 --> 04:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
rather than the uh relative Darkness or
 
04:23:28.750 --> 04:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
lightness of the film that uh protected
 
04:23:32.309 --> 04:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
against UVA UVB is that
 
04:23:35.349 --> 04:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
correct um I think they're probably uh
 
04:23:36.389 --> 04:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:23:37.710 --> 04:23:37.720 align:start position:0%
representative I think there are
 
04:23:39.870 --> 04:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
probably other industry people who could
 
04:23:43.630 --> 04:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
get um more detailed information on on
 
04:23:45.469 --> 04:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
that type of thing I I wouldn't want to
 
04:23:46.990 --> 04:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
venture to go
 
04:23:50.269 --> 04:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
there um one other quick followup Mr
 
04:23:50.279 --> 04:23:51.790 align:start position:0%
there um one other quick followup Mr
chair

04:23:51.790 --> 04:23:51.800 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:23:56.910 --> 04:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
yes um it it uh as as you work in
 
04:23:59.389 --> 04:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and just over the Border I
 
04:24:01.630 --> 04:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
wonder if um
 
04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's the myth or the rumor used to be
 
04:24:07.870 --> 04:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
that um there were a number of people
 
04:24:09.550 --> 04:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire that would still
 
04:24:13.030 --> 04:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
travel down to um to Massachusetts to
 
04:24:15.630 --> 04:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
have their windows tinted but but very
 
04:24:18.990 --> 04:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
lightly um is that something uh that you
 
04:24:21.990 --> 04:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
can confirm or deny um I'm sure there
 
04:24:24.389 --> 04:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
are people that do that uh when we have
 
04:24:27.030 --> 04:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents come down uh we
 
04:24:28.870 --> 04:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
will only do that if they do have the
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
waiver that is supplied by the
 
04:24:34.750 --> 04:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
state thank
 
04:24:41.189 --> 04:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:45.870 --> 04:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
witness yeah ankle One More Mr Ankerberg
 
04:24:49.750 --> 04:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
okay yep thank you um could could you
 
04:24:51.469 --> 04:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
just tell me how many window tint
 
04:24:55.030 --> 04:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
locations are in Massachusetts
 
04:24:58.790 --> 04:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
currently uh uh I do not have an answer
 
04:25:02.070 --> 04:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
to that question I I don't know I know
 
04:25:04.910 --> 04:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
we have two in the state I don't know
 
04:25:07.030 --> 04:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
how many others there are
 
04:25:09.269 --> 04:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
okay but it's but it's widely available
 
04:25:12.590 --> 04:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
oh yes okay thank
 
04:25:15.389 --> 04:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
you is that representative
 
04:25:18.269 --> 04:25:18.279 align:start position:0%
Gorski yes thank you Mr chairman and and
 
04:25:20.830 --> 04:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr sudit for your testimony
 
04:25:23.189 --> 04:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
and I have one quick question you
 
04:25:25.950 --> 04:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the tinted glass the UV
 
04:25:28.830 --> 04:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
protection reduces UV by
 
04:25:33.910 --> 04:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
99% is that based on the 35%
 
04:25:37.229 --> 04:25:37.239 align:start position:0%
tint um so it can VAR vary from film to
 
04:25:40.309 --> 04:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
film the films that we carry uh the
 
04:25:43.510 --> 04:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that we get them from um it
 
04:25:46.990 --> 04:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
is 99% for most of the
 
04:25:49.670 --> 04:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
darknesses but that as I said would vary
 
04:25:51.830 --> 04:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
from manufacturer to manufacturer not
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily from
 
04:25:57.950 --> 04:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
Darkness all right thank you thank
 
04:26:00.550 --> 04:26:00.560 align:start position:0%

224 uh what we are trying to promote are
 
04:26:53.750 --> 04:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable standards for window tinting
 
04:26:55.550 --> 04:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
and working with States across the
 
04:26:58.469 --> 04:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
across the country re reasonable state
 
04:27:00.149 --> 04:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
standards for window tinting in vehicles
 
04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
supports health
 
04:27:04.990 --> 04:27:05.000 align:start position:0%

uh I'd also like to say that no one
 
04:27:15.229 --> 04:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
benefits When a state window ending laws
 
04:27:18.670 --> 04:27:18.680 align:start position:0%
are either unreasonable or uh or
 
04:27:23.349 --> 04:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
ambiguous uh we like to have law uh laws
 
04:27:25.950 --> 04:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
that uh have a we use the term
 
04:27:29.469 --> 04:27:29.479 align:start position:0%
reasonable standard such that everybody
 
04:27:33.109 --> 04:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
is healthier safer uh and then and that
 
04:27:35.910 --> 04:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
our installers and um and business
 
04:27:38.149 --> 04:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
Business Leaders can can have a market
 
04:27:40.109 --> 04:27:40.119 align:start position:0%
in window afterm Market window ending in
 
04:27:42.670 --> 04:27:42.680 align:start position:0%
your state uh we understand that window
 
04:27:45.550 --> 04:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
ending laws raise concerns among law
 
04:27:47.469 --> 04:27:47.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement and uh we're willing to
 
04:27:49.510 --> 04:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
supply any information the committee may
 
04:27:51.389 --> 04:27:51.399 align:start position:0%

is any documentation showing
 
04:28:44.990 --> 04:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
um uh reduced visibility for the driver
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:51.469 --> 04:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
windows uh representative eron we do

information on um visibility glare the
 
04:29:04.510 --> 04:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
types of of issues that you might
 
04:29:06.870 --> 04:29:06.880 align:start position:0%

with information on
that

04:29:12.109 --> 04:29:12.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:29:17.429 --> 04:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
04:29:22.149 --> 04:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
torki thank you very much Mr chair um Mr
 
04:29:23.830 --> 04:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
schmith thank you for taking my question
 
04:29:25.990 --> 04:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
I remember in previous testimony on
 
04:29:29.389 --> 04:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
similar bills that
 
04:29:33.510 --> 04:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
um UV protection can be provided with an
 
04:29:38.469 --> 04:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
uncolored clear film is that
 
04:29:41.870 --> 04:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
accurate representative tki that is
 
04:29:45.349 --> 04:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
correct what well and UV protection is
 
04:29:48.109 --> 04:29:48.119 align:start position:0%
not the only thing that we're trying to
 
04:29:50.710 --> 04:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh achieve through window tining um when
 
04:29:52.349 --> 04:29:52.359 align:start position:0%
it comes to health and safety and and
 
04:29:54.830 --> 04:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
those types of things it's ALS it's also
 
04:29:57.109 --> 04:29:57.119 align:start position:0%
Comfort but you're essentially correct
 
04:29:59.750 --> 04:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
that UV protection can be provided with
 
04:30:02.510 --> 04:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
clear er uh window
 
04:30:06.109 --> 04:30:06.119 align:start position:0%
film thank you u m uh representative
 
04:30:07.830 --> 04:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
there there's your question about the
 
04:30:09.830 --> 04:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
70% been answered because I know I was
 
04:30:12.469 --> 04:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the earlier
 
04:30:14.830 --> 04:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
conversation well thank you for asking
 
04:30:17.550 --> 04:30:17.560 align:start position:0%
me the question um if the chair would
 
04:30:20.070 --> 04:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
allow I would like to have some
 
04:30:24.229 --> 04:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
clarification on um the differences
 
04:30:28.030 --> 04:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
between the 35% and the 70% as was
 
04:30:29.750 --> 04:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
amended last time because I do believe
 
04:30:33.269 --> 04:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
there was um a conflict in understanding
 
04:30:35.510 --> 04:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh is it light light going through or is
 
04:30:38.189 --> 04:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
it light being blocked so I if the chair
 
04:30:39.510 --> 04:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
would allow I would love that question
 
04:30:42.429 --> 04:30:42.439 align:start position:0%
answered why don't you Hold on until
 
04:30:44.670 --> 04:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
other people who haven't spoken to this
 
04:30:46.750 --> 04:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
witness yet get a chance and then I'll
 
04:30:49.510 --> 04:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
get back to you okay thank you okay
 
04:30:49.520 --> 04:30:51.550 align:start position:0%
get back to you okay thank you okay
representative

04:30:51.550 --> 04:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:30:55.030 --> 04:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
patal uh thank you chairman Walsh
 
04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
um I I guess my question actually goes
 
04:31:00.109 --> 04:31:00.119 align:start position:0%
back to this the tinting
 
04:31:03.229 --> 04:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
thing is there any correlation between
 
04:31:06.750 --> 04:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
the amount of tent and the UV protection
 
04:31:09.309 --> 04:31:09.319 align:start position:0%
are these two separate issues and really
 
04:31:09.319 --> 04:31:10.389 align:start position:0%
are these two separate issues and really
shouldn't

04:31:10.389 --> 04:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
04:31:15.590 --> 04:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
be uh lumped together so to speak yeah I
 
04:31:18.109 --> 04:31:18.119 align:start position:0%
think the previous representative
 
04:31:20.349 --> 04:31:20.359 align:start position:0%
pivotel that I think the previous
 
04:31:23.070 --> 04:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
testimony was correct that there you can
 
04:31:24.510 --> 04:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
get that UV
 
04:31:27.830 --> 04:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
protection without getting the 35%
 
04:31:30.830 --> 04:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
tinting um and you know there are there
 
04:31:35.229 --> 04:31:35.239 align:start position:0%
are various levels of tent not only 70%
 
04:31:38.349 --> 04:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
but 50% and so on
 
04:31:41.070 --> 04:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
so I think the answer to your question
 
04:31:42.910 --> 04:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
is yes they they are somewhat
 
04:31:44.630 --> 04:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
independent of one another but you won't
 
04:31:46.670 --> 04:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
get that UV protection without some
 
04:31:46.680 --> 04:31:48.109 align:start position:0%
get that UV protection without some
window

04:31:48.109 --> 04:31:48.119 align:start position:0%
window
 
04:31:52.670 --> 04:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
tinting follow-up question yes I've been
 
04:31:55.510 --> 04:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
told that manufactured
 
04:32:00.870 --> 04:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
cars the the windshield comes with UV
 
04:32:00.880 --> 04:32:02.149 align:start position:0%
cars the the windshield comes with UV
protection

04:32:02.149 --> 04:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
protection
 
04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
already is that do you know if that's
 
04:32:04.479 --> 04:32:05.990 align:start position:0%
already is that do you know if that's
correct

04:32:05.990 --> 04:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:32:08.590 --> 04:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
that is correct to my knowledge yes sir
 
04:32:08.600 --> 04:32:09.469 align:start position:0%
that is correct to my knowledge yes sir
thank

04:32:09.469 --> 04:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:32:12.950 --> 04:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:32:16.870 --> 04:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
enberg thank you Mr chairman um and
 
04:32:20.189 --> 04:32:20.199 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr Smith it is yes for your
 
04:32:23.550 --> 04:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
testimony um I was just wondering since
 
04:32:25.510 --> 04:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
this would be essentially bringing a new
 
04:32:30.149 --> 04:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
business uh a market into the state um
 
04:32:32.229 --> 04:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
do you have any information on you know
 
04:32:35.510 --> 04:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
how many cars are tinted after you a you
 
04:32:38.269 --> 04:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
know aftermarket annually or like what
 
04:32:43.630 --> 04:32:43.640 align:start position:0%
percentage of um already sold cars would
 
04:32:45.590 --> 04:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
would this affect do do you have
 
04:32:48.070 --> 04:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
anything that would um kind of provide a
 
04:32:50.349 --> 04:32:50.359 align:start position:0%
basis as to like how large a market this
 
04:32:52.389 --> 04:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
might be in New
 
04:32:55.349 --> 04:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire honestly repres Ankerberg I
 
04:32:57.229 --> 04:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
don't have that information but I think
 
04:32:59.550 --> 04:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
I could I could probably get it and I so
 
04:33:01.149 --> 04:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
I commit to you that we can provide
 
04:33:03.990 --> 04:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
something to the committee along those
 
04:33:08.070 --> 04:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
lines okay that that'd be great thank
 
04:33:11.869 --> 04:33:11.879 align:start position:0%
you representative O'Hara just quick
 
04:33:13.429 --> 04:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just quick question
 
04:33:15.109 --> 04:33:15.119 align:start position:0%
so the front windshield does have UV
 
04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
protection but does the side
 
04:33:21.269 --> 04:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
windows the the the side windows will
 
04:33:25.070 --> 04:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
have some degree of UV protection coming
 
04:33:28.590 --> 04:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
from uh from the factory it's and one of
 
04:33:30.070 --> 04:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
the one of the questions was asked
 
04:33:33.349 --> 04:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
earlier is about why 70% versus 35% or
 
04:33:36.189 --> 04:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
whatever the 70%
 
04:33:38.470 --> 04:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
is Factory glass essentially that's what
 
04:33:39.910 --> 04:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
comes from the
 
04:33:43.670 --> 04:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturer uh there is some degree of
 
04:33:46.070 --> 04:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
of protection with that glass however
 
04:33:48.269 --> 04:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
any window film on top of that glass
 
04:33:51.709 --> 04:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
would give additional UV protection so
 
04:33:53.789 --> 04:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
um and again
 
04:33:57.629 --> 04:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to be clear that you could
 
04:33:57.639 --> 04:33:58.990 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to be clear that you could
separate

04:33:58.990 --> 04:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
separate
 
04:34:01.869 --> 04:34:01.879 align:start position:0%
the the percentage from the UV
 
04:34:06.590 --> 04:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
protection but any any after
 
04:34:09.750 --> 04:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
Market tinting will give you UV
 
04:34:12.510 --> 04:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
protection thank
 
04:34:15.349 --> 04:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
you okay representative torki has your
 
04:34:18.150 --> 04:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
question been asked answered or would
 
04:34:20.310 --> 04:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
you like to
 
04:34:22.390 --> 04:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
pursue why don't you let everyone else
 
04:34:24.429 --> 04:34:24.439 align:start position:0%
ask questions there might be other um
 
04:34:27.709 --> 04:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
Witnesses coming up that would help me
 
04:34:30.789 --> 04:34:30.799 align:start position:0%
representative Hills hand is up okay
 
04:34:33.029 --> 04:34:33.039 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
04:34:34.709 --> 04:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr Schmidt for
 
04:34:39.310 --> 04:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
your test testimony I um I recall as
 
04:34:41.590 --> 04:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
well in years past and and in fact the
 
04:34:43.789 --> 04:34:43.799 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor mentioned the idea that we
 
04:34:47.150 --> 04:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
have a number of U people that transfers
 
04:34:50.150 --> 04:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
into uh New Hampshire from states that
 
04:34:52.349 --> 04:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
have window tinting and he mentioned
 
04:34:54.470 --> 04:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
that um he thought that there was
 
04:34:57.269 --> 04:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
training police training on how to deal
 
04:35:00.109 --> 04:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
with uh with cars when they uh when
 
04:35:02.910 --> 04:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
police are approaching is that anything
 
04:35:05.510 --> 04:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
that you're aware of um anywhere is
 
04:35:08.551 --> 04:35:08.561 align:start position:0%
there any other technique or or training
 
04:35:11.390 --> 04:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
that's done for police officers in other
 
04:35:15.551 --> 04:35:15.561 align:start position:0%
states that U that we were never able to
 
04:35:18.551 --> 04:35:18.561 align:start position:0%
get that answer for here in New
 
04:35:22.470 --> 04:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh representative Hill I uh
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any training that the
 
04:35:27.510 --> 04:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
iwfa does regarding police officers but
 
04:35:29.470 --> 04:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
we have done some extensive research
 
04:35:33.470 --> 04:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
into the different methods by which uh
 
04:35:36.150 --> 04:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
police officers use when they stopping a
 
04:35:39.590 --> 04:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle and uh and we uh you know we've
 
04:35:41.029 --> 04:35:41.039 align:start position:0%
done some work with New York State and
 
04:35:43.150 --> 04:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
with the state of Pennsylvania and
 
04:35:45.910 --> 04:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
others and there are differences uh
 
04:35:48.910 --> 04:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
We've suggested to other states that
 
04:35:51.150 --> 04:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
their reticence the police officers
 
04:35:54.510 --> 04:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
reticence for approving window tinting
 
04:35:58.750 --> 04:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
legis of of supporting window tinting
 
04:36:02.310 --> 04:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
legislation can be mitigated By changes
 
04:36:06.990 --> 04:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
in practices and uh and so we've done
 
04:36:09.150 --> 04:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
that on an informal basis not on
 
04:36:11.629 --> 04:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
anything in for informally but we do
 
04:36:13.029 --> 04:36:13.039 align:start position:0%
have information
 
04:36:16.429 --> 04:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
about how traffic stops are conducted
 
04:36:18.551 --> 04:36:18.561 align:start position:0%
and uh we be willing to provide that to
 
04:36:20.709 --> 04:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
the committee as well that would be
 
04:36:22.830 --> 04:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
wonderful I would appreciate that I'd
 
04:36:24.670 --> 04:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
also be interested if there's any
 
04:36:29.150 --> 04:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
differences um in officer safety um that
 
04:36:32.551 --> 04:36:32.561 align:start position:0%
you've been able to discern um in states
 
04:36:36.109 --> 04:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
with tinting and without tinting
 
04:36:38.390 --> 04:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
yes sir we'll see what we have on that
 
04:36:42.629 --> 04:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:45.070 --> 04:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
much do we have any other questions for
 
04:36:45.080 --> 04:36:47.470 align:start position:0%
much do we have any other questions for
this

04:36:47.470 --> 04:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:50.670 --> 04:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you sir thank
 
04:36:59.429 --> 04:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:07.910 --> 04:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
Whit yes thank you chair and um
 
04:37:12.230 --> 04:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
everybody here can you guys hear me I
 
04:37:14.470 --> 04:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
just want to do a quick sanity check
 
04:37:17.629 --> 04:37:17.639 align:start position:0%
very good awesome um so this is my
 
04:37:20.789 --> 04:37:20.799 align:start position:0%
second time uh back giving testimony I
 
04:37:24.949 --> 04:37:24.959 align:start position:0%
believe I was here uh about three years
 
04:37:27.390 --> 04:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
ago um but I've been on and off trying
 
04:37:30.990 --> 04:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
to come in strong favor uh for the last
 
04:37:32.990 --> 04:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
eight years since moving here from
 
04:37:35.869 --> 04:37:35.879 align:start position:0%
Arkansas um again I'm in strong favor
 
04:37:38.910 --> 04:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
for the 35% net volume light
 
04:37:41.510 --> 04:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
transmittance um this essentially means
 
04:37:44.070 --> 04:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
that the combined uh light transmittance
 
04:37:45.349 --> 04:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:37:48.029 --> 04:37:48.039 align:start position:0%
35% um I I think it's important to call
 
04:37:49.949 --> 04:37:49.959 align:start position:0%
out net because that takes into the
 
04:37:53.230 --> 04:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
account of um you know any kind of
 
04:37:55.670 --> 04:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
shading in the glass plus any kind of
 
04:37:57.390 --> 04:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
Tint that's applied to the
 
04:37:59.910 --> 04:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
glass um some other notes that I would
 
04:38:02.429 --> 04:38:02.439 align:start position:0%
like to uh point out is that this isn't
 
04:38:03.789 --> 04:38:03.799 align:start position:0%
you know I wouldn't be in favor for a
 
04:38:06.990 --> 04:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
limousine style tint which is around 5%
 
04:38:09.789 --> 04:38:09.799 align:start position:0%
um again I'm in favor of the 35% to the
 
04:38:13.789 --> 04:38:13.799 align:start position:0%
left and right of driver um personally I
 
04:38:17.709 --> 04:38:17.719 align:start position:0%
am affected by um you know the by
 
04:38:19.590 --> 04:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
essentially light uh which is
 
04:38:21.750 --> 04:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
photosensitivity from having dual
 
04:38:23.830 --> 04:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
stigmatism allergies and secondary
 
04:38:26.029 --> 04:38:26.039 align:start position:0%
symptoms of a thyroid disease um
 
04:38:29.109 --> 04:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
including dry eye so I am a person that
 
04:38:31.789 --> 04:38:31.799 align:start position:0%
does have to submit a um or go through
 
04:38:34.429 --> 04:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
the process of you know reaching out to
 
04:38:35.429 --> 04:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
my doctor
 
04:38:37.750 --> 04:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get them to write up a waiver
 
04:38:39.709 --> 04:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
that waiver going to the state and then
 
04:38:41.429 --> 04:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
waiting on the state to try to process
 
04:38:44.230 --> 04:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
that in order to get it back to me um
 
04:38:45.949 --> 04:38:45.959 align:start position:0%
being married my wife doesn't have to
 
04:38:49.390 --> 04:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
deal with these uh you know symptoms uh
 
04:38:51.189 --> 04:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
but we also share a vehicle so as you
 
04:38:53.390 --> 04:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
can imagine there are there are issues
 
04:38:56.109 --> 04:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
that have um somewhat Gone Gone
 
04:38:58.590 --> 04:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
unanswered since um you know for over
 
04:39:01.590 --> 04:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
the last8 years as to what happens when
 
04:39:03.750 --> 04:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
she gets pulled over um she's not on
 
04:39:05.750 --> 04:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
that uh she's not on the waiver it's
 
04:39:08.109 --> 04:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
only for me um and then the other issue
 
04:39:10.070 --> 04:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
is I have to renew that waiver every few
 
04:39:12.910 --> 04:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
years um so it's pretty
 
04:39:16.869 --> 04:39:16.879 align:start position:0%
inconvenient um I would also like to um
 
04:39:18.349 --> 04:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
and again I apologize I wasn't able to
 
04:39:20.429 --> 04:39:20.439 align:start position:0%
get this document over to the committee
 
04:39:23.390 --> 04:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
over email when I signed up um so I
 
04:39:24.750 --> 04:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
would like to try to send it just in
 
04:39:28.470 --> 04:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
case you guys want it um moving from you
 
04:39:32.150 --> 04:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
know anecdotal to more factual um
 
04:39:35.470 --> 04:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
reasons that I support this bill
 
04:39:36.990 --> 04:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
uh is because really New Hampshire is
 
04:39:39.070 --> 04:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
one of four states that ban the tent on
 
04:39:40.708 --> 04:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
the left and right of the driver while
 
04:39:44.190 --> 04:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
46 other states allow some level of tent
 
04:39:46.110 --> 04:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
um as I'm sure everybody's aware the
 
04:39:47.750 --> 04:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
current tent Laws affect thousands of
 
04:39:50.310 --> 04:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire drivers every day um
 
04:39:53.470 --> 04:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
excluding them from benefits uh such as
 
04:39:56.150 --> 04:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
but not limited to crash safety from
 
04:39:58.270 --> 04:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
shattered glass you know window film
 
04:40:00.510 --> 04:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
helps keep glass intact and and not
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
spread everywhere I believe that was
 
04:40:04.788 --> 04:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
brought up by another witness um some
 
04:40:07.070 --> 04:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
other facts including reducing the sun's
 
04:40:09.788 --> 04:40:09.798 align:start position:0%
glare um and helps prevent accidents due
 
04:40:12.470 --> 04:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
to solar glare um part of the benefit of
 
04:40:14.628 --> 04:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
having tent is not only the UV
 
04:40:16.670 --> 04:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
protection I think it should be
 
04:40:18.750 --> 04:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
considered as a secondary benefit you
 
04:40:20.788 --> 04:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
know having UV protection but the
 
04:40:23.590 --> 04:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
primary protections are so um the safety
 
04:40:26.510 --> 04:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
and the anti-glare uh
 
04:40:29.150 --> 04:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
components um keeping Vehicles more
 
04:40:31.830 --> 04:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable by reducing solar heat gain
 
04:40:34.270 --> 04:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
um also results in reducing emissions uh
 
04:40:38.708 --> 04:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
on on critical components um and what's
 
04:40:40.230 --> 04:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
actually really nice and what I have on
 
04:40:42.990 --> 04:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
my vehicle uh are modern ttin such as
 
04:40:46.310 --> 04:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
ceramic tints that have a really high um
 
04:40:49.150 --> 04:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
heat block um which is pretty incredible
 
04:40:51.310 --> 04:40:51.320 align:start position:0%
versus just the you know the the old
 
04:40:53.830 --> 04:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
school types of tins so the technology
 
04:40:53.840 --> 04:40:54.750 align:start position:0%
school types of tins so the technology
is

04:40:54.750 --> 04:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:40:56.948 --> 04:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
there um I would also like to include
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
that it includes privacy for drivers
 
04:41:00.990 --> 04:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
passengers and belonging which could
 
04:41:02.750 --> 04:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
potentially help reduce auto theft
 
04:41:05.550 --> 04:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
occurrences and break-ins um and lastly
 
04:41:07.350 --> 04:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
as someone had pointed out it also helps
 
04:41:09.030 --> 04:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
protect the interior from fading and and
 
04:41:11.070 --> 04:41:11.080 align:start position:0%
leather as a result of the secondary
 
04:41:12.868 --> 04:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
benefit of UV
 
04:41:15.150 --> 04:41:15.160 align:start position:0%
protection now on the other side of this
 
04:41:17.670 --> 04:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
I and I've I've brought this up in my
 
04:41:20.310 --> 04:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
last testimony a couple of years ago um
 
04:41:22.948 --> 04:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
I think it's it is important to note
 
04:41:25.030 --> 04:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
that I you know obviously as as all of
 
04:41:27.230 --> 04:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
us do respect the safety of law
 
04:41:29.230 --> 04:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement but I also believe at the
 
04:41:31.430 --> 04:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
same time law enforcement have tools at
 
04:41:33.830 --> 04:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
their disposal training and equipment to
 
04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
protect themselves
 
04:41:38.310 --> 04:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
um if an officer has a reason to believe
 
04:41:39.910 --> 04:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
they are in danger When approaching
 
04:41:42.150 --> 04:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
vehicles with tinted windows they can
 
04:41:43.708 --> 04:41:43.718 align:start position:0%
always order that person to open their
 
04:41:46.350 --> 04:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
Windows over the PA using spotlights
 
04:41:49.750 --> 04:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
calling for backups Etc it's worth also
 
04:41:51.270 --> 04:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
mentioning that when a police officer
 
04:41:53.070 --> 04:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
approaches the car or a vehicle and a
 
04:41:54.708 --> 04:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
traffic stop they tend to approach it
 
04:41:56.990 --> 04:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
from behind and we already allow window
 
04:42:00.830 --> 04:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
tent on the rear windows um so that's
 
04:42:02.990 --> 04:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
the first you know point of being able
 
04:42:04.670 --> 04:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
to see through someone's vehicle is the
 
04:42:04.680 --> 04:42:05.708 align:start position:0%
to see through someone's vehicle is the
rear

04:42:05.708 --> 04:42:05.718 align:start position:0%
rear
 
04:42:09.470 --> 04:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
windows now something that um going back
 
04:42:11.750 --> 04:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
to my opinion I while I don't agree that
 
04:42:14.670 --> 04:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
this bill goes far enough um I think
 
04:42:17.628 --> 04:42:17.638 align:start position:0%
it's a great start and by that I mean
 
04:42:20.868 --> 04:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
perhaps in the future we can consider um
 
04:42:23.750 --> 04:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
allowing normally the windshield to be
 
04:42:26.070 --> 04:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
tinted somewhat in line with
 
04:42:28.788 --> 04:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Main laws which allow
 
04:42:31.628 --> 04:42:31.638 align:start position:0%
5 to six Ines or down to the as1 line
 
04:42:33.788 --> 04:42:33.798 align:start position:0%
from the top of the windshield this
 
04:42:35.788 --> 04:42:35.798 align:start position:0%
would help with additional solar glare
 
04:42:37.628 --> 04:42:37.638 align:start position:0%
from the front-facing part of the driver
 
04:42:40.948 --> 04:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
versus only the left and right um so it
 
04:42:43.070 --> 04:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
would be a little bit more
 
04:42:45.510 --> 04:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
inclusion um so I believe that's it I
 
04:42:47.948 --> 04:42:47.958 align:start position:0%
would love to submit um you know I have
 
04:42:50.270 --> 04:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
a document here that I've I've spent a
 
04:42:53.788 --> 04:42:53.798 align:start position:0%
lot of time on with facts um references
 
04:42:55.910 --> 04:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
and I would be glad to send that forward
 
04:42:57.470 --> 04:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
along with answer any questions the
 
04:42:58.948 --> 04:42:58.958 align:start position:0%
committee may
 
04:43:02.550 --> 04:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
have thank you Mr Whit uh any questions
 
04:43:05.070 --> 04:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
04:43:07.150 --> 04:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
representative orara thank you Mr
 
04:43:09.390 --> 04:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
chairman just one quick question so
 
04:43:11.750 --> 04:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
while you were waiting for this waiver
 
04:43:14.030 --> 04:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
did you still have to drive your vehicle
 
04:43:17.030 --> 04:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
and and could that put other pedestrians
 
04:43:18.910 --> 04:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
in you at unsafe manner while waiting
 
04:43:19.990 --> 04:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
for this
 
04:43:22.628 --> 04:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
waiver well I I mean so there's two
 
04:43:24.708 --> 04:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
things to this um waiting for the waiver
 
04:43:26.670 --> 04:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
did take time but I also didn't wait to
 
04:43:30.948 --> 04:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
put on tent um I also preco had to drive
 
04:43:33.750 --> 04:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
and I went to work so it's kind of the
 
04:43:36.230 --> 04:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know role that dice kind of a gamble
 
04:43:39.110 --> 04:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
um what I did do was keep a doctor's
 
04:43:41.310 --> 04:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
note um while I waited for the waiver
 
04:43:43.750 --> 04:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
just in case I were to get pulled over
 
04:43:46.788 --> 04:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
um and it's important to note that um
 
04:43:48.390 --> 04:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
even now you know I still get pulled
 
04:43:50.550 --> 04:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
over from time to time even though I do
 
04:43:52.470 --> 04:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
have the waiver so it's kind of a waste
 
04:43:55.550 --> 04:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
of my time and resources um from the
 
04:43:58.430 --> 04:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
state to even have to you know pull me
 
04:44:00.190 --> 04:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
over for something silly like window
 
04:44:02.628 --> 04:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
tent in my
 
04:44:05.910 --> 04:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you
 
04:44:07.510 --> 04:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions for this witness
 
04:44:10.670 --> 04:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:13.590 --> 04:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
committee do I see representative Tori's
 
04:44:17.350 --> 04:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
hand up no no okay seeing none thank you
 
04:44:20.948 --> 04:44:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:25.830 --> 04:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further witnesses to
 
04:44:25.840 --> 04:44:27.510 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further witnesses to
testify

04:44:27.510 --> 04:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
testify
 
04:44:31.270 --> 04:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh I remember the man who normally sits
 
04:44:33.350 --> 04:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
in this chair I
 
04:44:33.360 --> 04:44:35.948 align:start position:0%
in this chair I
uh

04:44:35.948 --> 04:44:35.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:44:38.390 --> 04:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
do Mr chairman do I have to call out
 
04:44:39.868 --> 04:44:39.878 align:start position:0%
every name that's on this or just the
 
04:44:42.830 --> 04:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
total amount I've been doing it but if
 
04:44:44.590 --> 04:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
it's expensive you can just count up the
 
04:44:48.110 --> 04:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
opposed versus disappoints
 
04:44:48.120 --> 04:44:49.788 align:start position:0%
opposed versus disappoints
Okay

04:44:49.788 --> 04:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
Okay
 
04:44:52.310 --> 04:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
Hand don't have
 
04:44:52.320 --> 04:44:53.868 align:start position:0%
Hand don't have
to

04:44:53.868 --> 04:44:53.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:44:57.310 --> 04:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
right who's got the hand us is that
 
04:44:57.320 --> 04:44:58.350 align:start position:0%
right who's got the hand us is that
represent

04:44:58.350 --> 04:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
torki yes thank you I apologize I didn't
 
04:45:02.270 --> 04:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
have a question for the last person but
 
04:45:04.350 --> 04:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
I do have a question of the chair um is
 
04:45:05.708 --> 04:45:05.718 align:start position:0%
anyone from the Department of Safety
 
04:45:07.750 --> 04:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
signed up to
 
04:45:11.990 --> 04:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:16.390 --> 04:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:19.270 --> 04:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
okay okay I now see Hands I see Hands Up

on the other side of the attendees
 
04:45:24.470 --> 04:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
now including Sergeant Kelby who was I
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
was thought might help answer a
 
04:45:31.990 --> 04:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
question I don't see him we have two
 
04:45:34.310 --> 04:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
general public members one already spoke
 
04:45:36.670 --> 04:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
but Sergeant Christopher Kelby is on
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:44.990 --> 04:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
Kelby hello
 
04:45:48.190 --> 04:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
there hello Sergeant good how are you
 
04:45:51.190 --> 04:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
guys I apologize I was anticipating
 
04:45:53.070 --> 04:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
Captain Haynes to speak on this so I had
 
04:45:55.750 --> 04:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
prepared for the bill reference to the
 
04:45:59.550 --> 04:45:59.560 align:start position:0%
um to uh bicycles driving to the left of
 
04:46:01.628 --> 04:46:01.638 align:start position:0%
the roadway so I'm not quite as prepared
 
04:46:04.550 --> 04:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
as I'd like to be um I would like to
 
04:46:06.750 --> 04:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
make a couple comments um I do know that
 
04:46:08.150 --> 04:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
the department of safety is opposed to
 
04:46:11.350 --> 04:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
the bill um and you know unfortunately
 
04:46:13.910 --> 04:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
again I can't speak to uh what Captain
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
haes had prepared um I can only tell you
 
04:46:17.670 --> 04:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
my own personal experiences with window
 
04:46:19.390 --> 04:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
tent I want to address a couple of
 
04:46:22.470 --> 04:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
things one currently the state does
 
04:46:24.948 --> 04:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
allow a 6-inch strip uh to the top of
 
04:46:27.990 --> 04:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
the windshield uh with a 35% light
 
04:46:30.948 --> 04:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
transmittance requirement um the DMV
 
04:46:35.350 --> 04:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
does handle the uh um
 
04:46:35.360 --> 04:46:36.990 align:start position:0%
does handle the uh um
waivers

04:46:36.990 --> 04:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
waivers
 
04:46:40.590 --> 04:46:40.600 align:start position:0%
um relative to uh Vision you know
 
04:46:42.750 --> 04:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
obscurity uh there was some questions
 
04:46:47.270 --> 04:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
about uh whether or not uh window tin is
 
04:46:51.590 --> 04:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh or if the UV um transmittance could
 
04:46:54.868 --> 04:46:54.878 align:start position:0%
be covered by clear tint um while I was
 
04:46:57.230 --> 04:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
listening to that I went on the um bear
 
04:46:59.350 --> 04:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
with me a second the uh 3M automo
 
04:47:01.070 --> 04:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
Automotive Windows Solutions and they do
 
04:47:04.628 --> 04:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
actually offer um the 99%
 
04:47:04.638 --> 04:47:05.628 align:start position:0%
actually offer um the 99%
UV

04:47:05.628 --> 04:47:05.638 align:start position:0%
UV
 
04:47:08.510 --> 04:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
protection um and and we had talk I
 
04:47:10.310 --> 04:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
remember sitting in a little bit last
 
04:47:12.470 --> 04:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
year about this and and H and listening
 
04:47:13.910 --> 04:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
to that discussion that there is some
 
04:47:18.270 --> 04:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
aftermarket options there um excuse me I
 
04:47:21.190 --> 04:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
do want to address the officer safety uh
 
04:47:24.110 --> 04:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
comments because you know some of you
 
04:47:25.350 --> 04:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
know I've been in public service for
 
04:47:28.150 --> 04:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
over 30 years now 26 of them or 24 of
 
04:47:32.270 --> 04:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
them is a police officer and also being
 
04:47:34.190 --> 04:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
a knucklehead I have a one-year-old than
 
04:47:36.910 --> 04:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
a four-year-old so my kids like me to
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
come home at the end of the day uh I can
 
04:47:42.670 --> 04:47:42.680 align:start position:0%
speak to window 10 um from an officer
 
04:47:45.390 --> 04:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
safety perspective there is no training
 
04:47:47.470 --> 04:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
for a police officer to deal with window
 
04:47:50.190 --> 04:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
ENT on the side of the
 
04:47:52.470 --> 04:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
road there's there's that's just not
 
04:47:52.480 --> 04:47:53.510 align:start position:0%
road there's there's that's just not
something

04:47:53.510 --> 04:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:47:56.350 --> 04:47:56.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's covered under Police
 
04:47:58.310 --> 04:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
Academy because you can't see into a
 
04:48:00.390 --> 04:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
dark you know room without a flashlight
 
04:48:02.390 --> 04:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
or putting a light on it it's the same
 
04:48:06.190 --> 04:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
thing um window tint does cause me
 
04:48:08.948 --> 04:48:08.958 align:start position:0%
concern on a traffic stop uh there was a
 
04:48:11.868 --> 04:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
comment about uh window tint uh to the
 
04:48:14.470 --> 04:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
rear of the driver and front passenger
 
04:48:15.868 --> 04:48:15.878 align:start position:0%
and that's that's an that that's
 
04:48:17.990 --> 04:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
actually a good comment um and it is one
 
04:48:20.590 --> 04:48:20.600 align:start position:0%
thing that heightens my sensitivity for
 
04:48:23.510 --> 04:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
officer safety when I approach a car um
 
04:48:26.670 --> 04:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
if I can't see the back um the back
 
04:48:28.750 --> 04:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
windows are you guys still getting me on
 
04:48:31.590 --> 04:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
this y yes we are I'm having some
 
04:48:34.628 --> 04:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
connectivity uh issues today um um as I
 
04:48:37.070 --> 04:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
approach a car uh generally speaking I
 
04:48:38.990 --> 04:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
approach from the passenger side because
 
04:48:40.788 --> 04:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
nowadays I have to be concerned with a
 
04:48:41.990 --> 04:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
lot of things I have to be concerned
 
04:48:44.150 --> 04:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
with covid so I wear a mask just like
 
04:48:46.350 --> 04:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
everybody else does uh my biggest
 
04:48:48.150 --> 04:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
concerns nowadays aren't so much getting
 
04:48:50.510 --> 04:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
shot um although as you've seen the
 
04:48:53.070 --> 04:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
number of police officers assaulted this
 
04:48:55.150 --> 04:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
past couple years has been amazing my
 
04:48:58.070 --> 04:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
biggest concern is uh distracted drivers
 
04:48:59.270 --> 04:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh being run over on the side of the
 
04:49:01.510 --> 04:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
road those are huge concerns of mine uh
 
04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
so I started doing passenger side
 
04:49:04.470 --> 04:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
approaches um
 
04:49:09.788 --> 04:49:09.798 align:start position:0%
um it's nice to know as I do pass by uh
 
04:49:12.230 --> 04:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
or go get into the range of the B pillar
 
04:49:13.990 --> 04:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
which is the second column you know the
 
04:49:16.310 --> 04:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
column between the front and rear doors
 
04:49:19.070 --> 04:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
that I can look into that window and see
 
04:49:21.350 --> 04:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
who's sitting where and what's in their
 
04:49:24.510 --> 04:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
hands now that might be a self selfish
 
04:49:27.190 --> 04:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
self-centered uh response to you know
 
04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
the concerns that you know our citizens
 
04:49:31.350 --> 04:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
have about window T but that's a big
 
04:49:35.030 --> 04:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
concern for me and my family um it it is
 
04:49:37.510 --> 04:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
scary enough approaching that car and
 
04:49:40.390 --> 04:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
and U um not being able to see into the
 
04:49:42.470 --> 04:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
back but you know at least I can control
 
04:49:43.470 --> 04:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the front of the
 
04:49:45.470 --> 04:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle there's a lot of things that
 
04:49:48.628 --> 04:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
happen on a traffic stop uh that we
 
04:49:50.990 --> 04:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
really don't have any control over but
 
04:49:53.190 --> 04:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
being able to see inside of the vehicle
 
04:49:54.948 --> 04:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
is is one thing that gives us a lot more
 
04:49:56.390 --> 04:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
control because we can choose whether or
 
04:49:58.510 --> 04:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
not to continue to approach that vehicle
 
04:50:00.030 --> 04:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
and make contact with the traffic
 
04:50:03.548 --> 04:50:03.558 align:start position:0%
offender or not um again I I just want
 
04:50:06.708 --> 04:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
to L apologize I was not prepared to
 
04:50:09.788 --> 04:50:09.798 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill today um my my focus
 
04:50:12.150 --> 04:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
was more on the driving to the left with
 
04:50:14.670 --> 04:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
bicycles um but I did want to address a
 
04:50:16.190 --> 04:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
couple of those off officer safety
 
04:50:17.990 --> 04:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
concerns and and again I can tell you
 
04:50:19.590 --> 04:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
the department of safety is opposed to
 
04:50:21.510 --> 04:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
the left and right of the driver's side
 
04:50:24.548 --> 04:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
window tint um and certainly uh I can
 
04:50:26.590 --> 04:50:26.600 align:start position:0%
request Captain Haynes to offer written
 
04:50:28.708 --> 04:50:28.718 align:start position:0%
testimony uh and have him send that to
 
04:50:31.430 --> 04:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
you immediately um is is he did more
 
04:50:33.628 --> 04:50:33.638 align:start position:0%
research on this and and also was able
 
04:50:37.430 --> 04:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
to to look into uh fmvss standards and
 
04:50:39.230 --> 04:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
you know things like that as it relates
 
04:50:42.070 --> 04:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
to uh vehicle safety and
 
04:50:44.750 --> 04:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
design that would be great Sergeant
 
04:50:47.430 --> 04:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative Sykes you
 
04:50:47.440 --> 04:50:48.430 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative Sykes you
were

04:50:48.430 --> 04:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:50:51.750 --> 04:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
first thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
04:50:55.510 --> 04:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
Sergeant Kelby for taking my question um
 
04:50:58.750 --> 04:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
back in the day a long time ago I took a
 
04:51:01.830 --> 04:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
traffic control safety course in order
 
04:51:04.750 --> 04:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to do traffic details
 
04:51:06.868 --> 04:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
and part of the course was the
 
04:51:08.990 --> 04:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
importance of the person trying to
 
04:51:12.590 --> 04:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
control traffic to be able to see the
 
04:51:14.830 --> 04:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
eyes of the of a car that is approaching
 
04:51:17.110 --> 04:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
so you have a better sense of whether
 
04:51:18.990 --> 04:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
they see you and whether they're going
 
04:51:22.708 --> 04:51:22.718 align:start position:0%
to react in certain ways um I presume
 
04:51:23.990 --> 04:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
that that
 
04:51:26.750 --> 04:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
is something that a regular person
 
04:51:29.070 --> 04:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
sitting at a corner can look over to the
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
driver's side window and see that
 
04:51:34.150 --> 04:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
person's um looking at you looking at
 
04:51:36.788 --> 04:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
them or not do you have any information
 
04:51:38.670 --> 04:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
about whether that's an important
 
04:51:41.470 --> 04:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
consideration for Traffic Safety see
 
04:51:43.910 --> 04:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative syes this is why I wish I
 
04:51:48.510 --> 04:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
did some or some preparation today uh
 
04:51:51.190 --> 04:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
I've been driving for a long time and uh
 
04:51:53.070 --> 04:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
when I'm driving my Jeep uh with my kids
 
04:51:54.708 --> 04:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
in the back or whether I'm driving my
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
police car before I proceed through an
 
04:51:59.190 --> 04:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
intersection marked with a red and green
 
04:52:01.788 --> 04:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
light when my light turns green my foot
 
04:52:04.270 --> 04:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
does not release the brake until I look
 
04:52:06.030 --> 04:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
to my left and right and I can see what
 
04:52:08.590 --> 04:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
the person next to me is doing that eye
 
04:52:10.830 --> 04:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
contact is essential for my safety on
 
04:52:14.030 --> 04:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
the road uh certainly as a traffic as a
 
04:52:17.390 --> 04:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
traffic uh detail officer uh it would be
 
04:52:20.350 --> 04:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
very important for a police officer to
 
04:52:23.150 --> 04:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
be able to make contact visual contact
 
04:52:25.030 --> 04:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
with a driver of another vehicle to see
 
04:52:26.750 --> 04:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
what they're doing are is that person
 
04:52:29.070 --> 04:52:29.080 align:start position:0%
paying attention if you're a bicyclist
 
04:52:30.750 --> 04:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
approaching an intersection and I do
 
04:52:33.788 --> 04:52:33.798 align:start position:0%
bicycle occasionally I like to look to
 
04:52:35.270 --> 04:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
my left and right when I come into an
 
04:52:37.590 --> 04:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
intersection and make eye contact and
 
04:52:39.628 --> 04:52:39.638 align:start position:0%
and also when I'm running to make eye
 
04:52:41.350 --> 04:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
contact with the driver of another
 
04:52:42.590 --> 04:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle to make sure that they can
 
04:52:44.150 --> 04:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
recognize me and I can see that they
 
04:52:45.948 --> 04:52:45.958 align:start position:0%
recognize me I really appreciate you
 
04:52:47.190 --> 04:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
bringing that up because that is a very
 
04:52:47.200 --> 04:52:49.070 align:start position:0%
bringing that up because that is a very
important

04:52:49.070 --> 04:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:52:50.868 --> 04:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
fact thank
 
04:52:56.990 --> 04:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:00.030 --> 04:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my question
 
04:53:02.788 --> 04:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
um Sergeant Kelby I'm interested to know
 
04:53:05.910 --> 04:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
if you are aware of any specific
 
04:53:10.350 --> 04:53:10.360 align:start position:0%
training uh that officers receive in
 
04:53:14.190 --> 04:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
other states where windows are legally
 
04:53:19.150 --> 04:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
tinted um is that like training modules
 
04:53:21.670 --> 04:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
that can be added to our officer
 
04:53:23.430 --> 04:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
trainings here in New
 
04:53:26.830 --> 04:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I I cannot uh representive
 
04:53:28.868 --> 04:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
eron I cannot speak to what other states
 
04:53:32.110 --> 04:53:32.120 align:start position:0%
do I can speak to the the experience
 
04:53:34.350 --> 04:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
that I do have uh
 
04:53:36.390 --> 04:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
with 24 24 years in law enforcement
 
04:53:39.030 --> 04:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
being a field training officer uh being
 
04:53:41.750 --> 04:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
formerly a member of a SWAT team um we
 
04:53:45.150 --> 04:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
do high-risk traffic stop training but
 
04:53:48.548 --> 04:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
there is a certain assumption um when
 
04:53:50.990 --> 04:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
when we make uh when we do make a
 
04:53:55.390 --> 04:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
traffic stop that we try to identify any
 
04:53:58.910 --> 04:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
risks that we can see um and and it's
 
04:54:01.750 --> 04:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
key that we be able to see those risks
 
04:54:04.190 --> 04:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
um so as far as the state of New
 
04:54:06.390 --> 04:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is concerned no we do not
 
04:54:08.670 --> 04:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
offer any training relative to window
 
04:54:10.548 --> 04:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
ENT as far as officer safety is
 
04:54:13.070 --> 04:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
concerned outside of conducting highrisk
 
04:54:16.270 --> 04:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
traffic stops which I would consider a a
 
04:54:17.868 --> 04:54:17.878 align:start position:0%
a a traffic stop with a vehicle with
 
04:54:20.190 --> 04:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
window 10 to be relatively high risk
 
04:54:21.590 --> 04:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
because I don't know what's going on
 
04:54:23.910 --> 04:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
inside that vehicle and you know and we
 
04:54:25.628 --> 04:54:25.638 align:start position:0%
live in a time where a lot of people do
 
04:54:28.510 --> 04:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
not respect the police uh really aren't
 
04:54:30.830 --> 04:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
willing to make contact with us when
 
04:54:32.390 --> 04:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
we're attempting to make contact with
 
04:54:34.670 --> 04:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
them uh I can tell
 
04:54:37.230 --> 04:54:37.240 align:start position:0%
you God hundreds of times I've made
 
04:54:39.230 --> 04:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
traffic stops and violators have only
 
04:54:41.868 --> 04:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
rolled down the window maybe um you know
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
an inch or two and slid the their
 
04:54:46.150 --> 04:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
documents outside of the uh outside of
 
04:54:48.150 --> 04:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
the side view so I still have no idea
 
04:54:50.190 --> 04:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
what's going on in that vehicle so I
 
04:54:52.270 --> 04:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
can't answer your question I can only
 
04:54:53.708 --> 04:54:53.718 align:start position:0%
tell you what the state of New Hampshire
 
04:54:57.190 --> 04:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
does uh and certainly uh uh dealing with
 
04:54:58.990 --> 04:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
window tin outside of a high-risk
 
04:55:00.628 --> 04:55:00.638 align:start position:0%
traffic stop how to conduct a traffic
 
04:55:02.230 --> 04:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
stop we don't cover because there's
 
04:55:06.390 --> 04:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:09.030 --> 04:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any other questions
 
04:55:12.190 --> 04:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:16.110 --> 04:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
sergeant ah representative
 
04:55:18.230 --> 04:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
Ankerberg thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:55:21.548 --> 04:55:21.558 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Sergeant kby
 
04:55:24.830 --> 04:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
um when you pull over a vehicle if you
 
04:55:29.910 --> 04:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
suspect that there is some um you know
 
04:55:32.110 --> 04:55:32.120 align:start position:0%
behavior in that vehicle that could be a
 
04:55:35.150 --> 04:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
threat to you is it permissible to
 
04:55:37.270 --> 04:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
extract the driver or order the driver
 
04:55:39.670 --> 04:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
out of the vehicle could could could you
 
04:55:42.150 --> 04:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
do that through a PA system
 
04:55:43.868 --> 04:55:43.878 align:start position:0%
representative that's not a good
 
04:55:45.470 --> 04:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
question to
 
04:55:48.548 --> 04:55:48.558 align:start position:0%
ask not a good question to ask okay
 
04:55:50.230 --> 04:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
Sergeant you don't have to answer that
 
04:55:52.628 --> 04:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
question okay we're just talking about
 
04:55:54.788 --> 04:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
tinted windows
 
04:55:58.070 --> 04:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:00.948 --> 04:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
apologies uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:56:03.430 --> 04:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Sergeant how do you handle um
 
04:56:05.830 --> 04:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
um when you pull over a resident from St
 
04:56:07.590 --> 04:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that has tinted windows
 
04:56:09.868 --> 04:56:09.878 align:start position:0%
how would you handle that
 
04:56:12.590 --> 04:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
situation well again I I I considered a
 
04:56:15.190 --> 04:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
high-risk traffic stop so I do the best
 
04:56:18.750 --> 04:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
I can to minimize threat to myself um
 
04:56:20.510 --> 04:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
typically passenger side approach Behind
 
04:56:22.030 --> 04:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
the B column I'll knock on the window
 
04:56:24.150 --> 04:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
until the driver acknowledges it it's
 
04:56:26.070 --> 04:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
really a game at that point if someone
 
04:56:28.470 --> 04:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
wants to do me harm I have less chance
 
04:56:30.990 --> 04:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
of recognizing it before that harm is
 
04:56:33.990 --> 04:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
done than I would with a clear window so
 
04:56:36.750 --> 04:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
regardless it's still a dangerous tactic
 
04:56:38.670 --> 04:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
for a police officer to make contact
 
04:56:40.270 --> 04:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
with an offender on the side of the road
 
04:56:42.470 --> 04:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
that has tinted windows we handle it the
 
04:56:44.670 --> 04:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
same way but there is no training or
 
04:56:46.230 --> 04:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
Preparation that the officer can make
 
04:56:48.030 --> 04:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
outside of some sound officer tactics
 
04:56:49.750 --> 04:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
like trying to maintain some form of
 
04:56:53.190 --> 04:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
cover behind that b pillar um assuming
 
04:56:54.750 --> 04:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
that the person in the back seat doesn't
 
04:56:57.510 --> 04:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
want to do you harm now I I don't want
 
04:57:00.350 --> 04:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
you to think that every time I stop a
 
04:57:02.350 --> 04:57:02.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle I'm you know concerned that
 
04:57:03.910 --> 04:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
there are machine guns in there but I
 
04:57:06.590 --> 04:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
have been assaulted on traffic stops uh
 
04:57:09.350 --> 04:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
from drivers out of state and in state I
 
04:57:11.590 --> 04:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
have dealt with uh weapons calls on
 
04:57:14.910 --> 04:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
traffic stops most notably I testified
 
04:57:17.230 --> 04:57:17.240 align:start position:0%
last year I think about a traffic stop I
 
04:57:20.470 --> 04:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
had made in Manchester on 93 and the guy
 
04:57:24.150 --> 04:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
did have uh rear tinted windows and when
 
04:57:26.910 --> 04:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
I walked up he had two assault rifles
 
04:57:29.548 --> 04:57:29.558 align:start position:0%
and a pistol on his on his seat
 
04:57:31.110 --> 04:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
thankfully when I was making that
 
04:57:33.430 --> 04:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
approach he did not have tinted front
 
04:57:35.910 --> 04:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
windows which made me a little more
 
04:57:37.430 --> 04:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable and that I could see where
 
04:57:39.310 --> 04:57:39.320 align:start position:0%
his hands were when I was making that
 
04:57:43.628 --> 04:57:43.638 align:start position:0%
stop um so again there's really you
 
04:57:46.270 --> 04:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
can't deal with the stop any differently
 
04:57:47.948 --> 04:57:47.958 align:start position:0%
than you do any other stop when they
 
04:57:49.788 --> 04:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
have tinted windows other than make that
 
04:57:49.798 --> 04:57:51.948 align:start position:0%
have tinted windows other than make that
assumed

04:57:51.948 --> 04:57:51.958 align:start position:0%
assumed
 
04:57:55.510 --> 04:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
risk thank you any other questions for
 
04:57:55.520 --> 04:57:57.230 align:start position:0%
risk thank you any other questions for
this

04:57:57.230 --> 04:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:57:59.788 --> 04:57:59.798 align:start position:0%

public who all are in support of this
 
04:58:41.868 --> 04:58:41.878 align:start position:0%
bill Mr J you have have one member of
 
04:58:43.708 --> 04:58:43.718 align:start position:0%
the public William Haynes with his hand
 
04:58:46.990 --> 04:58:47.000 align:start position:0%

04:58:50.750 --> 04:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
yeah okay Mr Haynes is it Captain Haynes
 
04:58:53.310 --> 04:58:53.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know just say William Mar Haynes
 
04:58:55.510 --> 04:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
how you doing so yes it is Mr chairman
 
04:58:56.990 --> 04:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee it is Captain
 
04:58:58.310 --> 04:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
Bill Haynes with the New Hampshire offic
 
04:59:00.270 --> 04:59:00.280 align:start position:0%
of Highway Safety how is everyone
 
04:59:06.150 --> 04:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:07.430 --> 04:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead so I just wanted to weigh into
 
04:59:08.990 --> 04:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
little everyone know as much as in many
 
04:59:10.470 --> 04:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
years in the past uh the office of
 
04:59:12.548 --> 04:59:12.558 align:start position:0%
Highway Safety in Department of Safety
 
04:59:15.150 --> 04:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
in general is is a a pose to this bill
 
04:59:16.830 --> 04:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
due to a number of reasons understanding
 
04:59:18.510 --> 04:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
all the testimony that's been provided
 
04:59:20.670 --> 04:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
both previously and now we still think
 
04:59:23.670 --> 04:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
there's a detrimental uh danger to law
 
04:59:25.708 --> 04:59:25.718 align:start position:0%
enforcement in general should this bill
 
04:59:25.718 --> 04:59:28.510 align:start position:0%
enforcement in general should this bill
be

04:59:28.510 --> 04:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:32.030 --> 04:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:32.040 --> 04:59:34.270 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:59:34.270 --> 04:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:59:40.868 --> 04:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:43.390 --> 04:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
close represent stev representative
 
04:59:47.270 --> 04:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:50.788 --> 04:59:50.798 align:start position:0%
up she's muted you're muted
 
04:59:55.390 --> 04:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:58.868 --> 04:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
representative I apologize someday I'll
 
05:00:02.670 --> 05:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
get all this straight um uh thank you Mr
 
05:00:07.670 --> 05:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
chair and um Captain I wondered if there
 
05:00:11.270 --> 05:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
were um statistics
 
05:00:16.590 --> 05:00:16.600 align:start position:0%
available on the number of um incidences
 
05:00:21.190 --> 05:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
where uh an officer safety was
 
05:00:25.150 --> 05:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
compromised because of having a tinted
 
05:00:25.160 --> 05:00:27.868 align:start position:0%
compromised because of having a tinted
window

05:00:27.868 --> 05:00:27.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:30.110 --> 05:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
situation mam representative I don't
 
05:00:32.230 --> 05:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
have anything in particular based on on
 
05:00:34.628 --> 05:00:34.638 align:start position:0%
pure facts and numbers to provide at
 
05:00:37.670 --> 05:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
this time um however I think the Crux of
 
05:00:39.910 --> 05:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
our argument is having done this like
 
05:00:42.750 --> 05:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
many officers for many years is that
 
05:00:44.868 --> 05:00:44.878 align:start position:0%
with everything going on both past and
 
05:00:46.948 --> 05:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
present is the approachment of that
 
05:00:48.670 --> 05:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle and trying to be alert as to
 
05:00:50.670 --> 05:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
what's going on but more importantly a
 
05:00:52.070 --> 05:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
lot of the arguments that have been
 
05:00:54.030 --> 05:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
presented has to do with causes of
 
05:00:55.788 --> 05:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
cancer and things of that nature when
 
05:00:58.548 --> 05:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
there is a clear tint available that can
 
05:01:00.150 --> 05:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
be applied to these vehicles for those
 
05:01:02.230 --> 05:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
types of people who may have skin cancer
 
05:01:04.110 --> 05:01:04.120 align:start position:0%
and I
 
05:01:06.310 --> 05:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
that in full transparency I do have some
 
05:01:08.830 --> 05:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
battles with some skin cancer myself um
 
05:01:10.070 --> 05:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
having been deployed in the Middle East
 
05:01:12.270 --> 05:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
for a number of years in my prior career
 
05:01:13.788 --> 05:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
um so I'm fully aware of what the
 
05:01:16.788 --> 05:01:16.798 align:start position:0%
detriment can be um but as a as a
 
05:01:18.628 --> 05:01:18.638 align:start position:0%
trooper and having been a trooper for 19
 
05:01:20.910 --> 05:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
years and doing this both day and night
 
05:01:23.868 --> 05:01:23.878 align:start position:0%
and also taking concern for pedestrians
 
05:01:25.990 --> 05:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh on the roadways and the ability to
 
05:01:27.830 --> 05:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
have eye contact when operating a motor
 
05:01:29.788 --> 05:01:29.798 align:start position:0%
vehicle at intersections and weighing
 
05:01:31.390 --> 05:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
all those facts knowing now that
 
05:01:33.190 --> 05:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
technolog is available to mitigate that
 
05:01:35.628 --> 05:01:35.638 align:start position:0%
skin cancer I just think it's a it's not
 
05:01:37.670 --> 05:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
a good presidence to take for all of
 
05:01:41.548 --> 05:01:41.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:44.830 --> 05:01:44.840 align:start position:0%

05:05:58.868 --> 05:05:58.878 align:start position:0%
so you know um every session I try to
 
05:06:00.510 --> 05:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
move to Hampshire a little further to
 
05:06:01.990 --> 05:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
The Cutting Edge of transportation
 
05:06:05.948 --> 05:06:05.958 align:start position:0%
technology ology last time the committee
 
05:06:08.070 --> 05:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
handled the rotable aircraft bill or the
 
05:06:10.830 --> 05:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
Jetson bill as it was dubbed nationally
 
05:06:12.190 --> 05:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
uh this one you might think of as the
 
05:06:14.470 --> 05:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
Pizza Robot Bill so there are a lot of
 
05:06:16.708 --> 05:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
companies building autonomous delivery
 
05:06:19.310 --> 05:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
devices they're on Wheels they typically
 
05:06:21.270 --> 05:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
will have to travel on sidewalks or
 
05:06:25.470 --> 05:06:25.480 align:start position:0%
other hard services to deliver medicine
 
05:06:27.990 --> 05:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
documents pizza and a host of other
 
05:06:30.910 --> 05:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
things so the version of the bill that
 
05:06:33.708 --> 05:06:33.718 align:start position:0%
you have before you Mr chair I will
 
05:06:36.628 --> 05:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask the committee to retain
 
05:06:39.150 --> 05:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
because this was the first version I got
 
05:06:40.590 --> 05:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
from a state senator that I know in
 
05:06:42.868 --> 05:06:42.878 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island that was working on the
 
05:06:45.788 --> 05:06:45.798 align:start position:0%
same topic since then I've talked to
 
05:06:47.030 --> 05:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
some of the stakeholders that will
 
05:06:49.110 --> 05:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
operate in New Hampshire and some of the
 
05:06:52.470 --> 05:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
design specs in this need to be changed
 
05:06:54.548 --> 05:06:54.558 align:start position:0%
um how much the things weigh how fast
 
05:06:56.948 --> 05:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
can they go on the sidewalk how big are
 
05:07:00.390 --> 05:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
they can they ever go on the road um so
 
05:07:01.910 --> 05:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
I imagine from what I've heard we're
 
05:07:03.788 --> 05:07:03.798 align:start position:0%
going to get lots of input from that
 
05:07:05.628 --> 05:07:05.638 align:start position:0%
from the people that actually build the
 
05:07:07.070 --> 05:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
things but it's important to get a
 
05:07:09.470 --> 05:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
regulatory package in place because if
 
05:07:12.670 --> 05:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
you recall um the the Uber Bill
 
05:07:14.830 --> 05:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
generally our first reaction is well we
 
05:07:15.948 --> 05:07:15.958 align:start position:0%
don't want to weigh them down with
 
05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
regulations but where there are none
 
05:07:19.390 --> 05:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
it's kind of the wild west and you
 
05:07:20.830 --> 05:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
actually attract more business and
 
05:07:22.390 --> 05:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
industry when they know what the rules
 
05:07:24.628 --> 05:07:24.638 align:start position:0%
of the game are and that's my hope to
 
05:07:28.788 --> 05:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
accomplish what with this bill so um as
 
05:07:31.030 --> 05:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
little carts that ride around bringing
 
05:07:32.948 --> 05:07:32.958 align:start position:0%
you things that you ask for
 
05:07:34.750 --> 05:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
and we have to figure out a way to make
 
05:07:37.070 --> 05:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
them legal and establish liability rules
 
05:07:39.150 --> 05:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's all the bill does and I
 
05:07:40.750 --> 05:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
would look forward to if you choose to
 
05:07:43.788 --> 05:07:43.798 align:start position:0%
retain it to a fun summer with cool
 
05:07:45.948 --> 05:07:45.958 align:start position:0%
technology people showing us awesome
 
05:07:49.470 --> 05:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
things thank you thank you Mr
 
05:07:51.670 --> 05:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
representative uh any questions for
 
05:07:51.680 --> 05:07:54.070 align:start position:0%
representative uh any questions for
representative

05:07:54.070 --> 05:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:07:57.310 --> 05:07:57.320 align:start position:0%
Smith wow looks like they're letting you
 
05:07:58.110 --> 05:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
off the
 
05:08:01.030 --> 05:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
hook you got one wait a
 
05:08:04.030 --> 05:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
minute well representative tarki be
 
05:08:05.470 --> 05:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
super quick thank you Mr chair
 
05:08:07.310 --> 05:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
representative Smith just to educate
 
05:08:09.628 --> 05:08:09.638 align:start position:0%
those of us who are new to this concept
 
05:08:11.670 --> 05:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
I know I've seen this on the news with
 
05:08:14.150 --> 05:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
um different companies testing them
 
05:08:16.230 --> 05:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
FedEx Amazon that type of thing is there
 
05:08:17.670 --> 05:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
actually any place in the country yet
 
05:08:20.788 --> 05:08:20.798 align:start position:0%
that allows this in different
 
05:08:23.110 --> 05:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities I believe there is I
 
05:08:25.350 --> 05:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
don't have that list with me today
 
05:08:27.628 --> 05:08:27.638 align:start position:0%
that's okay thank
 
05:08:31.868 --> 05:08:31.878 align:start position:0%
you any other questions represent pataro
 
05:08:33.628 --> 05:08:33.638 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you
 
05:08:35.750 --> 05:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative Smith um I don't know if
 
05:08:37.470 --> 05:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
we'll get into this later or not but
 
05:08:39.230 --> 05:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
what's the Practical difference between
 
05:08:41.788 --> 05:08:41.798 align:start position:0%
a personal delivery device and a mobile
 
05:08:45.830 --> 05:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
carrier the the um I believe the carrier
 
05:08:48.788 --> 05:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
is the entity and the device is the
 
05:08:51.110 --> 05:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
thing gotcha so one of the things you'll
 
05:08:53.830 --> 05:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
be asked to delve into is if there's an
 
05:08:56.548 --> 05:08:56.558 align:start position:0%
actual human being who is in charge of
 
05:08:58.548 --> 05:08:58.558 align:start position:0%
the device that's going around are there
 
05:08:59.990 --> 05:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
different liability rules for that
 
05:09:01.788 --> 05:09:01.798 align:start position:0%
person as opposed to The Entity as a
 
05:09:05.270 --> 05:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
whole so yeah it'll be a fun
 
05:09:08.310 --> 05:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
summer that's a whole day hearing any
 
05:09:08.320 --> 05:09:09.150 align:start position:0%
summer that's a whole day hearing any
other

05:09:09.150 --> 05:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:09:13.110 --> 05:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I have a
 
05:09:17.190 --> 05:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
question so instead of it being thank
 
05:09:19.948 --> 05:09:19.958 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so instead of
 
05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
it being retained Would we not want to
 
05:09:25.990 --> 05:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
maybe perhaps uh turn this into a
 
05:09:29.270 --> 05:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
committee Bill where we asked to have a
 
05:09:35.110 --> 05:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:37.390 --> 05:09:37.400 align:start position:0%
issue I'm sorry I don't think you mean
 
05:09:39.750 --> 05:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
like a study committee yeah well no
 
05:09:41.070 --> 05:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
because then it's dead right because the
 
05:09:42.708 --> 05:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
Senate isn't going to want to do it and
 
05:09:44.110 --> 05:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
even if they do we're going to have to
 
05:09:45.628 --> 05:09:45.638 align:start position:0%
wait a long time because the first thing
 
05:09:47.750 --> 05:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate does on those bills is amend
 
05:09:50.868 --> 05:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
themselves out of it and send it back so
 
05:09:53.150 --> 05:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
I can accomplish the goal if this
 
05:09:55.470 --> 05:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
Committee of experts that I've found
 
05:09:57.708 --> 05:09:57.718 align:start position:0%
over the years really Embrace stuff like
 
05:10:00.430 --> 05:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
this just works on it decides if it's
 
05:10:02.628 --> 05:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
something they want to do or not get the
 
05:10:06.110 --> 05:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
Kinks out uh hear from FedEx hear from
 
05:10:08.350 --> 05:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
Mr Cayman and the experts to get the
 
05:10:10.670 --> 05:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
specs in it right I don't think I think
 
05:10:12.708 --> 05:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
we need to go that okay thank you
 
05:10:12.718 --> 05:10:15.590 align:start position:0%
we need to go that okay thank you
appreciate

05:10:15.590 --> 05:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:15.600 --> 05:10:18.788 align:start position:0%
 
that

05:10:18.788 --> 05:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:22.430 --> 05:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
SES thank you Mr chairman um
 
05:10:25.430 --> 05:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative Smith um it's been my
 
05:10:28.628 --> 05:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
experience that uh you and others in the
 
05:10:30.030 --> 05:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
transportation committee have worked
 
05:10:32.590 --> 05:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
really hard at trying to bring
 
05:10:34.868 --> 05:10:34.878 align:start position:0%
technology forward in order to uh
 
05:10:38.150 --> 05:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
improve improve jobs improve economy
 
05:10:40.430 --> 05:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
improve safety has it been your
 
05:10:43.910 --> 05:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
experience that um this committee the
 
05:10:45.310 --> 05:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
transportation committee has
 
05:10:47.830 --> 05:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
successfully retained and then presented
 
05:10:50.390 --> 05:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
a better copy of the
 
05:10:53.110 --> 05:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
bills yeah absolutely thank you for that
 
05:10:55.110 --> 05:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
question it's not the first time I've
 
05:10:57.628 --> 05:10:57.638 align:start position:0%
asked the to do this with what I heard
 
05:11:00.750 --> 05:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
someone refer to as one of Smith's
 
05:11:02.830 --> 05:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
projects but
 
05:11:04.670 --> 05:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that the people that are on
 
05:11:06.070 --> 05:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
this committee are the right group of
 
05:11:08.030 --> 05:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
people to sort through this and give a
 
05:11:11.070 --> 05:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:13.990 --> 05:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
Senate thank you for
 
05:11:17.110 --> 05:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
that anybody
 
05:11:20.230 --> 05:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
else seeing none I'll close the public
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
05:11:24.390 --> 05:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
116 uh I have nothing else on our sheets
 
05:11:27.150 --> 05:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of people signing
 
05:11:29.788 --> 05:11:29.798 align:start position:0%
in and in terms of moving into our
 
05:11:31.190 --> 05:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
executive session I see we're a little
 
05:11:32.590 --> 05:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
bit behind
 
05:11:34.310 --> 05:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh but we are going to take a few minute
 
05:11:38.070 --> 05:11:38.080 align:start position:0%

05:28:11.628 --> 05:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
committee here I'm not really after this
 
05:28:11.638 --> 05:28:13.030 align:start position:0%
committee here I'm not really after this
last

05:28:13.030 --> 05:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
last
 
05:28:15.830 --> 05:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
little thing it's all good I'm ready to
 
05:28:17.788 --> 05:28:17.798 align:start position:0%
get in the ring again all right can I
 
05:28:20.470 --> 05:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
you mind if I speak to the motion
 
05:28:23.350 --> 05:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay so the motion is for
 
05:28:25.110 --> 05:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment to adopt this amendment
 
05:28:26.948 --> 05:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
what I did and I think I mentioned to
 
05:28:29.750 --> 05:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
this everybody uh last week when we
 
05:28:31.190 --> 05:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
heard the bill
 
05:28:33.070 --> 05:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh the house clerk just to streamline
 
05:28:35.670 --> 05:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
things going forward with our sessions
 
05:28:38.070 --> 05:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
was hoping that we could uh come
 
05:28:39.948 --> 05:28:39.958 align:start position:0%
together and merge some of the similar
 
05:28:42.470 --> 05:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
bills on in our committees so I looked
 
05:28:44.868 --> 05:28:44.878 align:start position:0%
at the three of them that I pretty much
 
05:28:46.990 --> 05:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
thought would be uh amendable to
 
05:28:49.830 --> 05:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
everybody and that's what this does this
 
05:28:53.030 --> 05:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
takes 451 as the carrier or the vehicle
 
05:28:55.350 --> 05:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
if you will and it takes the entire
 
05:28:57.390 --> 05:28:57.400 align:start position:0%
contents of House Bill
 
05:29:00.470 --> 05:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
159 and which is uh basically the
 
05:29:02.110 --> 05:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
Knights of Columbus from representative
 
05:29:05.990 --> 05:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
olry and the contents of uh House Bill
 
05:29:08.708 --> 05:29:08.718 align:start position:0%
361 representative Grahams bills
 
05:29:10.750 --> 05:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
relative to Goldstar family
 
05:29:13.670 --> 05:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
decals um if you need more time to to
 
05:29:15.788 --> 05:29:15.798 align:start position:0%
scroll through it I think you'll notice
 
05:29:18.110 --> 05:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
if you put them side by side with the
 
05:29:20.948 --> 05:29:20.958 align:start position:0%
the original versions it actually cleans
 
05:29:24.190 --> 05:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
it up quite a bit and uh the content is
 
05:29:26.510 --> 05:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
the same this just streamlines the
 
05:29:28.070 --> 05:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
process moving
 
05:29:32.230 --> 05:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
forward so any questions on it or you
 
05:29:35.510 --> 05:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:42.310 --> 05:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:46.070 --> 05:29:46.080 align:start position:0%

none uh typically in the past I guess
 
05:31:29.150 --> 05:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
I'll call the question uh in the past we
 
05:31:32.030 --> 05:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
have been able to do this by uh I Voice
 
05:31:34.230 --> 05:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
vote but in today's day we have to do
 
05:31:37.390 --> 05:31:37.400 align:start position:0%
everything by roll call Mr chair Miss
 
05:31:39.750 --> 05:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative ER I'm sorry um everybody
 
05:31:41.910 --> 05:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
who is voting needs to be visual on the

going to go into the voting mode in a
 
05:31:47.190 --> 05:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
minute if you could all go visual that
 
05:31:48.910 --> 05:31:48.920 align:start position:0%

chairman yeah go ahead I think it also
 
05:32:10.430 --> 05:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
goes a lot smoother if everyone removes
 
05:32:11.750 --> 05:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
themselves off of
 
05:32:14.628 --> 05:32:14.638 align:start position:0%

that 19 to zero normally Mr chairman U
 
05:35:55.230 --> 05:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
this would not go into consent because
 
05:35:58.670 --> 05:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
it's an FN however with 190 I would move
 
05:36:01.390 --> 05:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
consent any objection to consent I think
 
05:36:03.030 --> 05:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
the FN is low enough that it wouldn't
 
05:36:06.788 --> 05:36:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:12.910 --> 05:36:12.920 align:start position:0%

05:48:11.910 --> 05:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you Mr chairman so the
 
05:48:14.270 --> 05:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh the underlying Bill covered special
 
05:48:16.990 --> 05:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
plates for municipal elected officials
 
05:48:19.070 --> 05:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
specifically allowing them to get decal
 
05:48:21.070 --> 05:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
plates one of the problems with the
 
05:48:23.430 --> 05:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
underlying bill was it was never worked
 
05:48:26.150 --> 05:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
out who the controlling agency or agent
 
05:48:28.708 --> 05:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
would be who would issue the decals and
 
05:48:30.270 --> 05:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
it also wasn't clear that there was
 
05:48:33.350 --> 05:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
actually buying from municipalities that
 
05:48:35.868 --> 05:48:35.878 align:start position:0%
they would pay
 
05:48:40.230 --> 05:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
produce have and agree to the annual
 
05:48:43.150 --> 05:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
reporting so uh give representative
 
05:48:45.910 --> 05:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
blanger a chance to work all that out
 
05:48:48.468 --> 05:48:48.478 align:start position:0%
and not actually kill the bill I'm
 
05:48:50.628 --> 05:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
proposing an amendment to clean up a
 
05:48:53.670 --> 05:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
problem that we have is also related to
 
05:48:55.510 --> 05:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
special plates for elected officials in
 
05:48:58.670 --> 05:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
this case it's us though the um the
 
05:49:01.190 --> 05:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
statute on cover plates is a little
 
05:49:04.350 --> 05:49:04.360 align:start position:0%
vague it says the director May uh issue
 
05:49:07.830 --> 05:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
two sets of cover plates but now those
 
05:49:09.390 --> 05:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
of us that have been in for a while know
 
05:49:11.628 --> 05:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
what actually happens is when there
 
05:49:14.430 --> 05:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
isn't a pandemic you arrive right after
 
05:49:16.628 --> 05:49:16.638 align:start position:0%
convening day go downstairs where they
 
05:49:18.948 --> 05:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
have the great creative plates all the
 
05:49:21.030 --> 05:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
seat number plates and they give them
 
05:49:23.030 --> 05:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
out to you and if you have a title or a
 
05:49:25.548 --> 05:49:25.558 align:start position:0%
leadership position you request those
 
05:49:28.910 --> 05:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
and you get them later now technically
 
05:49:31.430 --> 05:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
the director isn't supposed to issue
 
05:49:33.430 --> 05:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
those plates to you until you take your
 
05:49:35.628 --> 05:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
seat plates off your car and turn them
 
05:49:38.868 --> 05:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
in who does that nobody I I'm unaware of
 
05:49:40.390 --> 05:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
anybody that's ever done it so what
 
05:49:42.750 --> 05:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
happens is you end up with or plates and
 
05:49:44.990 --> 05:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
you hang them on your wall or something
 
05:49:48.468 --> 05:49:48.478 align:start position:0%
like that four sets of plates rather so
 
05:49:50.110 --> 05:49:50.120 align:start position:0%
I promised the director that we would
 
05:49:52.350 --> 05:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
look at the statute and just clean it up
 
05:49:56.070 --> 05:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
to codify what has always gone on before
 
05:49:58.990 --> 05:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's all it does
 
05:50:01.670 --> 05:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles she permitted me to tell
 
05:50:04.310 --> 05:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
you has no position on it um it's just
 
05:50:06.590 --> 05:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
pretty much internal legislative policy
 
05:50:08.190 --> 05:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
whatever we want to do she'll make it
 
05:50:11.150 --> 05:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
happen and uh we love her hopefully
 
05:50:13.670 --> 05:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
she's in that job for a while and the
 
05:50:16.310 --> 05:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
amendment does one other
 
05:50:20.350 --> 05:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
thing the cler of the house is an
 
05:50:23.868 --> 05:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
elected officer of the general court and
 
05:50:27.430 --> 05:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
a phrase up at the top authorizes him to
 
05:50:31.670 --> 05:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
get cover plates as well um that's in
 
05:50:34.070 --> 05:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
there because he asked for it so we know
 
05:50:36.708 --> 05:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
he wants them why isn't the Sergeant at
 
05:50:39.230 --> 05:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
Arms there he didn't ask happy to look
 
05:50:42.548 --> 05:50:42.558 align:start position:0%
at that next year if he so desires but
 
05:50:43.750 --> 05:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
those are the only two things the
 
05:50:45.350 --> 05:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
amendment does and it replaces the
 
05:50:48.230 --> 05:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
entire Bill uh representative blanger
 
05:50:49.788 --> 05:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
will either work out his issues on the
 
05:50:52.110 --> 05:50:52.120 align:start position:0%
municipal plates or not if he does he
 
05:50:54.390 --> 05:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
can bring that back um but in the
 
05:50:57.948 --> 05:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
meanwhile we at least get this done and
 
05:51:00.230 --> 05:51:00.240 align:start position:0%

05:58:12.990 --> 05:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
chairman I just wanted to um say that as
 
05:58:15.070 --> 05:58:15.080 align:start position:0%
written I'm in support and would vote
 
05:58:18.708 --> 05:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
for this bill but um it is my hope that
 
05:58:21.110 --> 05:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
the the transportation committee when it
 
05:58:23.150 --> 05:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
when it gets to the Senate could
 
05:58:25.788 --> 05:58:25.798 align:start position:0%
represent that perhaps the Professional
 
05:58:28.548 --> 05:58:28.558 align:start position:0%
Engineers um from the New Hampshire
 
05:58:30.548 --> 05:58:30.558 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and the Public
 
05:58:33.270 --> 05:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
Works Association might be added to the
 
05:58:36.430 --> 05:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
list of organizations that are covered
 
05:58:38.670 --> 05:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
under this
 
05:58:41.350 --> 05:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
bill I see no issue with presenting it
 
05:58:43.750 --> 05:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
to the Senate when it gets to that point
 
05:58:43.760 --> 05:58:44.788 align:start position:0%
to the Senate when it gets to that point
Thank

05:58:44.788 --> 05:58:44.798 align:start position:0%
Thank
 
05:58:44.798 --> 05:58:47.948 align:start position:0%
Thank
You

05:58:47.948 --> 05:58:47.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:51.430 --> 05:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
C yes thank you Mr chairman uh in
 
05:58:53.548 --> 05:58:53.558 align:start position:0%
principle I'm opposed to this for two
 
05:58:56.030 --> 05:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
reasons one is we have too many
 
05:58:59.468 --> 05:58:59.478 align:start position:0%
commissions already in just seems
 
05:59:02.830 --> 05:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
Superfluous and more importantly I think
 
05:59:05.750 --> 05:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
we have to trust the professionals on
 
05:59:08.110 --> 05:59:08.120 align:start position:0%
Hazen drive and the Department of
 
05:59:10.830 --> 05:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
Transportation to uh come up with
 
05:59:14.510 --> 05:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
traffic light sequencing etc etc I don't
 
05:59:17.030 --> 05:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
think we need a separate Commission of
 
05:59:18.750 --> 05:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
amateurs who don't know anything about
 
05:59:21.670 --> 05:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
it so that's my take on
 
05:59:26.030 --> 05:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
it represent Flav anybody
 
05:59:28.510 --> 05:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
else okay seeing
 
05:59:28.520 --> 05:59:31.708 align:start position:0%
else okay seeing
done

05:59:35.070 --> 05:59:35.080 align:start position:0%

current statute of RSA 261 colon
 
06:06:47.910 --> 06:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
752 to require that antique custom and
 
06:06:50.070 --> 06:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
street rod Vehicles as defined in our
 
06:06:52.510 --> 06:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
statutes be allowed to display only one

requirements will remain in effect for
 
06:07:00.150 --> 06:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
all other vehicles this change is a
 
06:07:02.310 --> 06:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
compromise for those automobile owners
 
06:07:04.670 --> 06:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
who have expressed the problem that two
 
06:07:07.030 --> 06:07:07.040 align:start position:0%

revenue for the State of New Hampshire
 
06:07:19.310 --> 06:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
with this bill with this amendment and
 
06:07:21.830 --> 06:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
pretty much this amendment
 
06:07:24.310 --> 06:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
replaces the language that was
 
06:07:27.788 --> 06:07:27.798 align:start position:0%
originally offered in the original bill
 
06:07:31.750 --> 06:07:31.760 align:start position:0%

H thank
 
06:07:57.628 --> 06:07:57.638 align:start position:0%
you I I believe I sent out um a copy to
 
06:08:01.150 --> 06:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
all of the members uh yesterday or the
 
06:08:01.160 --> 06:08:02.788 align:start position:0%
all of the members uh yesterday or the
day

06:08:02.788 --> 06:08:02.798 align:start position:0%
day
 
06:08:05.310 --> 06:08:05.320 align:start position:0%
before was my next question but I'm not
 
06:08:07.310 --> 06:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing everybody acknowledging I
 
06:08:08.990 --> 06:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
think everybody got
 
06:08:13.270 --> 06:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:13.280 --> 06:08:15.708 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

06:08:15.708 --> 06:08:15.718 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:08:18.070 --> 06:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
clki thank you Mr chair I'm just curious
 
06:08:20.468 --> 06:08:20.478 align:start position:0%
if representative Aaron um ran this
 
06:08:23.070 --> 06:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
verbiage by anyone at the um
 
06:08:28.468 --> 06:08:28.478 align:start position:0%
DMV you ask her um just based on their
 
06:08:28.478 --> 06:08:29.948 align:start position:0%
DMV you ask her um just based on their
uh

06:08:29.948 --> 06:08:29.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:08:36.788 --> 06:08:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:38.990 --> 06:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
06:08:41.468 --> 06:08:41.478 align:start position:0%
SS thank you for indulging me Mr
 
06:08:45.150 --> 06:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
chairman um I I'm also the one question
 
06:08:48.070 --> 06:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
that I had about this was
 
06:08:51.628 --> 06:08:51.638 align:start position:0%
um the original bill has a fiscal note
 
06:08:53.830 --> 06:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
um this amendment does not have a fiscal
 
06:08:57.390 --> 06:08:57.400 align:start position:0%
note we have no way to judge uh what
 
06:09:00.150 --> 06:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
effect this may have on state revenues
 
06:09:03.750 --> 06:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
and so I I pause in my support because
 
06:09:03.760 --> 06:09:04.670 align:start position:0%
and so I I pause in my support because
of

06:09:04.670 --> 06:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:09:08.628 --> 06:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
that may I answer sure actually do my
 
06:09:12.548 --> 06:09:12.558 align:start position:0%
guess so um I would imagine the impact
 
06:09:15.590 --> 06:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
to uh tolling Revenue would be minimal
 
06:09:19.788 --> 06:09:19.798 align:start position:0%
since um there's a very small subset of
 
06:09:21.788 --> 06:09:21.798 align:start position:0%
the general vehicle
 
06:09:24.750 --> 06:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
population um that it would affect
 
06:09:33.390 --> 06:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:36.350 --> 06:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um Mr chairman yeah the
 
06:09:39.430 --> 06:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
the other part of this question um not
 
06:09:43.230 --> 06:09:43.240 align:start position:0%
just the fiscal note but also um we have
 
06:09:45.948 --> 06:09:45.958 align:start position:0%
not gotten any uh feedback from the
 
06:09:47.310 --> 06:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles if there
 
06:09:49.910 --> 06:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
will be any computerized changes within
 
06:09:51.670 --> 06:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
their database system that they will be
 
06:09:53.868 --> 06:09:53.878 align:start position:0%
required to do which generally can be
 
06:09:57.110 --> 06:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
quite expensive um in the in term ter of
 
06:09:59.868 --> 06:09:59.878 align:start position:0%
about well typically we've learned from
 
06:10:02.270 --> 06:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
license plates that there's a $100,000
 
06:10:05.270 --> 06:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
cost to change uh you know I don't know
 
06:10:07.110 --> 06:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
that that's the case here I just that's
 
06:10:10.708 --> 06:10:10.718 align:start position:0%
the point I don't know but um in Prior
 
06:10:11.948 --> 06:10:11.958 align:start position:0%
changes with
 
06:10:15.708 --> 06:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
DMV the changes at DMV their offices and
 
06:10:17.868 --> 06:10:17.878 align:start position:0%
all of the local towns and cities that
 
06:10:22.510 --> 06:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
also uh process registration uh requests
 
06:10:25.910 --> 06:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
um there's an issue there too so anyways
 
06:10:28.868 --> 06:10:28.878 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate your uh the
 
06:10:31.788 --> 06:10:31.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak well I I'll I'll
 
06:10:33.910 --> 06:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
take that one representative SES um
 
06:10:38.548 --> 06:10:38.558 align:start position:0%
reading the reading the amendment over
 
06:10:41.548 --> 06:10:41.558 align:start position:0%
uh the way I read it everybody's still
 
06:10:43.628 --> 06:10:43.638 align:start position:0%
going to be getting issued two plates
 
06:10:45.110 --> 06:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
nothing is going to change in terms of
 
06:10:46.868 --> 06:10:46.878 align:start position:0%
the Department of Motor Vehicles or the
 
06:10:49.350 --> 06:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
towns the only thing that changes would
 
06:10:51.750 --> 06:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
be the requirement that the people that
 
06:10:53.548 --> 06:10:53.558 align:start position:0%
have both plates have to put both on the
 
06:10:56.070 --> 06:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
vehicles so the way I read this a lot of
 
06:10:57.190 --> 06:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
people are going to have an extra plate
 
06:10:59.590 --> 06:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
laying around not a lot the ones that
 
06:11:01.990 --> 06:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
that apply to this uh I see no changes
 
06:11:02.990 --> 06:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
in the amount that are going to be
 
06:11:04.310 --> 06:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
issued or
 
06:11:06.510 --> 06:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
purchased that's how I read
 
06:11:09.190 --> 06:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh um I'm chairman
 
06:11:12.948 --> 06:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
Walsh um well I would imagine if there
 
06:11:15.430 --> 06:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh they got antique plates there are
 
06:11:18.350 --> 06:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
special antique plates so I imagine that
 
06:11:22.190 --> 06:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
they would only have to issue one to uh
 
06:11:24.430 --> 06:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
the owner of the antique vehicle instead
 
06:11:27.190 --> 06:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
of two so I mean there's special plates
 
06:11:28.868 --> 06:11:28.878 align:start position:0%
to begin
 
06:11:34.868 --> 06:11:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:37.350 --> 06:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
that so I think it would kind of make it
 
06:11:41.750 --> 06:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
easy for motor vehicle to to imploy you
 
06:11:43.510 --> 06:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
know Implement that so that they would
 
06:11:45.990 --> 06:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
only have to
 
06:11:49.390 --> 06:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
um distribute one of the antique plates
 
06:11:52.548 --> 06:11:52.558 align:start position:0%
to the owner instead of two well it's
 
06:11:54.990 --> 06:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
it's the way I see this again the
 
06:11:56.868 --> 06:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
director may make special rules relative
 
06:11:58.548 --> 06:11:58.558 align:start position:0%
to the number plate the number of plates
 
06:12:00.590 --> 06:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
may make them doesn't mean they're going
 
06:12:03.110 --> 06:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
to if it's too costly or cost
 
06:12:05.510 --> 06:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
prohibitive they probably will not so
 
06:12:07.670 --> 06:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
that means um everybody's still going to
 
06:12:10.030 --> 06:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
get to the only thing that changes from
 
06:12:12.910 --> 06:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
here on in is that you only as the owner
 
06:12:15.830 --> 06:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
if you fall into these these situations
 
06:12:18.628 --> 06:12:18.638 align:start position:0%
have to display one of them um I see I
 
06:12:20.030 --> 06:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
don't see a mandate in the reading here
 
06:12:21.910 --> 06:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
that mandates that the director is going
 
06:12:23.750 --> 06:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
to change rules to only issue one it
 
06:12:28.948 --> 06:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:31.788 --> 06:12:31.798 align:start position:0%
represent representative Smith thank you
 
06:12:34.230 --> 06:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and I agree with you you look
 
06:12:37.430 --> 06:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
at the legal language in the bill direct
 
06:12:41.548 --> 06:12:41.558 align:start position:0%
the division vehicles to do at all we
 
06:12:43.910 --> 06:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
passed the bill today and it's effective
 
06:12:45.510 --> 06:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
tomorrow they will still be doing
 
06:12:47.830 --> 06:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
tomorrow what they did today the the
 
06:12:50.670 --> 06:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
bill is enforcement whether or not the
 
06:12:53.190 --> 06:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
person has to actually install the pl
 
06:13:01.310 --> 06:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:03.750 --> 06:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so as you know
 
06:13:07.430 --> 06:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
in the past I've never voted for um the
 
06:13:12.590 --> 06:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:15.628 --> 06:13:15.638 align:start position:0%
one compromise and I don't think it's
 
06:13:18.070 --> 06:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
going to affect many vehicles out on the
 
06:13:20.390 --> 06:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
road and I think the majority of the
 
06:13:22.030 --> 06:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
vehicles on the road are still going to
 
06:13:26.468 --> 06:13:26.478 align:start position:0%
have the two plates so if the um if the
 
06:13:28.868 --> 06:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
Amendment passes I'm going to vote
 
06:13:30.590 --> 06:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
affirmative if the amendment doesn't
 
06:13:32.390 --> 06:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
pass then I probably won't vote for the
 
06:13:35.948 --> 06:13:35.958 align:start position:0%
reg the original Bill thank you thank
 
06:13:38.750 --> 06:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
you anybody
 
06:13:41.350 --> 06:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
else I'll close with saying just this
 
06:13:44.548 --> 06:13:44.558 align:start position:0%
that uh this is another frequent flyer
 
06:13:47.150 --> 06:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
in my years in this committee I've been
 
06:13:49.868 --> 06:13:49.878 align:start position:0%
on both sides of this issue last time I
 
06:13:51.510 --> 06:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
voted for it without this type of
 
06:13:53.830 --> 06:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
amendment but you know what with all the
 
06:13:55.750 --> 06:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
apprehension I think this amendment is a
 
06:13:57.750 --> 06:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
good comprom so I'm willing to support
 
06:14:00.510 --> 06:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
it uh that being said if nobody else has
 
06:14:02.708 --> 06:14:02.718 align:start position:0%
anything else I agree with that uh I
 
06:14:04.070 --> 06:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
will ask the clerk to call the role
 
06:14:06.430 --> 06:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
whenever she's
 
06:14:09.430 --> 06:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
ready we're voting on house
 
06:14:14.390 --> 06:14:14.400 align:start position:0%

06:16:04.670 --> 06:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:09.190 --> 06:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:11.270 --> 06:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
welcome okay the motion on the floor is
 
06:16:12.948 --> 06:16:12.958 align:start position:0%
now out to pass as Amendment on House
 
06:16:14.548 --> 06:16:14.558 align:start position:0%
Bill 260
 
06:16:17.708 --> 06:16:17.718 align:start position:0%
FN uh is there any further discussion I
 
06:16:19.708 --> 06:16:19.718 align:start position:0%
think after discussing the amendment
 
06:16:21.750 --> 06:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
we've discuss the
 
06:16:24.230 --> 06:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
bill I I wouldn't agree with that
 
06:16:26.310 --> 06:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
statement I'm sorry Mr chairman I think
 
06:16:28.468 --> 06:16:28.478 align:start position:0%
there's more discussion to be had oh not
 
06:16:30.910 --> 06:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
fair enough it's still open any anybody
 
06:16:34.548 --> 06:16:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:38.468 --> 06:16:38.478 align:start position:0%
speak um I will I will just point out
 
06:16:41.350 --> 06:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
that um I I I want to make the point
 
06:16:44.070 --> 06:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
that I appreciate Senator uh excuse me
 
06:16:46.150 --> 06:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative Aaron's effort this
 
06:16:49.788 --> 06:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
was a a well researched um amendment
 
06:16:52.750 --> 06:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
that she's offered it is a improvement
 
06:16:55.070 --> 06:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
over the original bill from our from my
 
06:16:59.390 --> 06:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
perspective not withstanding that um I
 
06:17:04.590 --> 06:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
am concerned about the vast array of
 
06:17:07.590 --> 06:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
agencies that came before us gave
 
06:17:10.590 --> 06:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
testimony in opposition to a single
 
06:17:14.190 --> 06:17:14.200 align:start position:0%
license plate those included um the the
 
06:17:18.750 --> 06:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
association of chiefs of police the um
 
06:17:21.390 --> 06:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles rep uh
 
06:17:22.750 --> 06:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
Captain William Haynes from the
 
06:17:25.590 --> 06:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety also the office of
 
06:17:29.190 --> 06:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh highway safety all of these agencies
 
06:17:32.270 --> 06:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
um spoke against the bill there are
 
06:17:35.430 --> 06:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
still concerns about the possibility I
 
06:17:39.670 --> 06:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
admit much reduced now um about some
 
06:17:41.708 --> 06:17:41.718 align:start position:0%
Revenue which we have no idea what that
 
06:17:45.270 --> 06:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
would be the actual impact and finally
 
06:17:47.628 --> 06:17:47.638 align:start position:0%
um again much reduced but there'll still
 
06:17:49.708 --> 06:17:49.718 align:start position:0%
be an impact on the ability of police
 
06:17:54.468 --> 06:17:54.478 align:start position:0%
offices to um follow up on Amber Alerts
 
06:17:57.990 --> 06:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
and finally all always the purpose of
 
06:18:01.190 --> 06:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
licensed tags is to make it possible to
 
06:18:04.350 --> 06:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
identify the vehicle that may or may not
 
06:18:07.230 --> 06:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
be that they need to be aware of the
 
06:18:09.468 --> 06:18:09.478 align:start position:0%
identity of that vehicle and while it's
 
06:18:11.310 --> 06:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
a reduced number don't know what that
 
06:18:14.628 --> 06:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
reduced number is um for all of these
 
06:18:17.110 --> 06:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
reasons I would still oppose uh the
 
06:18:21.070 --> 06:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:26.468 --> 06:18:26.478 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you uh chairman Walsh um just
 
06:18:29.628 --> 06:18:29.638 align:start position:0%
want to say that I I um I appreciated
 
06:18:31.270 --> 06:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
all the testimony from law enforcement
 
06:18:32.468 --> 06:18:32.478 align:start position:0%
about their concerns with the front
 
06:18:33.868 --> 06:18:33.878 align:start position:0%
plates I even talked to some friends who
 
06:18:36.030 --> 06:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
work in security and know of their
 
06:18:38.030 --> 06:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
specific concerns as well so I was
 
06:18:39.590 --> 06:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
hesitant on this one but with the
 
06:18:42.310 --> 06:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
amendment I am satisfied on a personal
 
06:18:45.788 --> 06:18:45.798 align:start position:0%
level because I do own a 1989 Cadillac
 
06:18:48.708 --> 06:18:48.718 align:start position:0%
alante which is an extremely rare
 
06:18:52.670 --> 06:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
car putting myself advate I feel that if
 
06:18:54.548 --> 06:18:54.558 align:start position:0%
I were to rob a bank while driving that
 
06:18:57.150 --> 06:18:57.160 align:start position:0%
car the police would have an APV out on
 
06:18:59.628 --> 06:18:59.638 align:start position:0%
a classic car they would be able to
 
06:19:01.910 --> 06:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
identify the car in and of itself if
 
06:19:04.830 --> 06:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
were if it were an antique or a road a
 
06:19:09.708 --> 06:19:09.718 align:start position:0%
custom or or a street r as it were so um
 
06:19:12.590 --> 06:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
I think the law enforcement thing um is
 
06:19:15.350 --> 06:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
really minimized by this
 
06:19:23.990 --> 06:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:26.670 --> 06:19:26.680 align:start position:0%
else I'll close by saying too as much as
 
06:19:28.788 --> 06:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
I appreciate
 
06:19:31.430 --> 06:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
our's testimony and always do and always
 
06:19:31.440 --> 06:19:33.750 align:start position:0%
our's testimony and always do and always
respect

06:19:33.750 --> 06:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
respect
 
06:19:35.868 --> 06:19:35.878 align:start position:0%
them don't change like some of the
 
06:19:37.990 --> 06:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
actual data and numbers that supposedly
 
06:19:40.868 --> 06:19:40.878 align:start position:0%
will be shortened by doing something
 
06:19:43.910 --> 06:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
like this and we don't get them um I
 
06:19:46.230 --> 06:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
look at this amendment is a great
 
06:19:48.948 --> 06:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
compromise uh I heard the word being
 
06:19:51.150 --> 06:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
lower in Impact I think it's going to be
 
06:19:54.190 --> 06:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
pretty much IND discernable so I think
 
06:19:56.510 --> 06:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
this is a great compromise and and
 
06:19:58.270 --> 06:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to support the
 
06:20:02.430 --> 06:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
OTP as amended so with that being said
 
06:20:03.868 --> 06:20:03.878 align:start position:0%
oh I
 
06:20:09.270 --> 06:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:12.670 --> 06:20:12.680 align:start position:0%
pel thank you Mr chairman uh I'd like us
 
06:20:17.548 --> 06:20:17.558 align:start position:0%
to uh vote to
 
06:20:22.030 --> 06:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
uh vote to reject vote no on this and
 
06:20:24.590 --> 06:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
then do a new vote just to retain the
 
06:20:27.548 --> 06:20:27.558 align:start position:0%
bill so we can find out these answers
 
06:20:30.030 --> 06:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
that we're all concerned
 
06:20:33.230 --> 06:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
with fair enough um right now the motion
 
06:20:35.548 --> 06:20:35.558 align:start position:0%
on the floor is to pass is amended if
 
06:20:36.990 --> 06:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
that's not successful then we can
 
06:20:38.468 --> 06:20:38.478 align:start position:0%
entertain another
 
06:20:42.548 --> 06:20:42.558 align:start position:0%
motion that's my idea thank
 
06:20:45.390 --> 06:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
you as you know the bill is a frequent
 
06:20:47.310 --> 06:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
flyer and we've been hearing it for
 
06:20:50.150 --> 06:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
about six eight years and to address
 
06:20:51.990 --> 06:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
those concerns of law enforcement I said
 
06:20:53.350 --> 06:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
well we've got a great example it's
 
06:20:55.150 --> 06:20:55.160 align:start position:0%
geographically relevant same kind of
 
06:20:57.708 --> 06:20:57.718 align:start position:0%
terrain same town structure Vermont
 
06:20:59.548 --> 06:20:59.558 align:start position:0%
recently for a number of years did not
 
06:21:02.070 --> 06:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
require a front plate they had the um
 
06:21:05.510 --> 06:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
Vermont strong front plates on so I
 
06:21:08.510 --> 06:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
asked the chief's Association Department
 
06:21:11.788 --> 06:21:11.798 align:start position:0%
of Safety I hear
 
06:21:15.948 --> 06:21:15.958 align:start position:0%
you but somebody from that says all of
 
06:21:18.230 --> 06:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
those things occur that they experienced
 
06:21:20.230 --> 06:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
those problems they next door neighbor
 
06:21:22.548 --> 06:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
that would be the best data possible six
 
06:21:24.750 --> 06:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
or eight years later still waiting I
 
06:21:26.708 --> 06:21:26.718 align:start position:0%
don't believe retaining for 6 months is
 
06:21:28.670 --> 06:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
going to change that we've been asking
 
06:21:32.708 --> 06:21:32.718 align:start position:0%
for six or eight years so I just feel
 
06:21:34.590 --> 06:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
like it's time to move on at this point
 
06:21:35.868 --> 06:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
you would think that if there were
 
06:21:37.430 --> 06:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
problems so they would have came to the
 
06:21:39.830 --> 06:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee with that and said here's what
 
06:21:42.110 --> 06:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
happened here's the problems that caused
 
06:21:43.868 --> 06:21:43.878 align:start position:0%
here's the harm to the public and then I
 
06:21:45.708 --> 06:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
would have been a noo but that that's
 
06:21:46.788 --> 06:21:46.798 align:start position:0%
not what
 
06:21:49.270 --> 06:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
happened thank you representative

representative syes thank you um I I'm
 
06:23:27.590 --> 06:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
with this new uh hybrid model that we're
 
06:23:30.070 --> 06:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
now using it's not clear to me how we
 
06:23:32.750 --> 06:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
would present uh a Minority Report and
 
06:23:35.390 --> 06:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
when that happens but um I'm going to
 
06:23:37.350 --> 06:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
suggest that a Minority Report would be
 
06:23:37.360 --> 06:23:38.468 align:start position:0%
suggest that a Minority Report would be
in

06:23:38.468 --> 06:23:38.478 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:23:41.030 --> 06:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
order W it's funny in my courtesy to let
 
06:23:42.430 --> 06:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
you go first that's about what I was
 
06:23:46.150 --> 06:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:48.110 --> 06:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
say there was going to be a Minority
 
06:23:51.390 --> 06:23:51.400 align:start position:0%
Report on this we do have a template uh
 
06:23:54.510 --> 06:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
that we can email whoever wants to do
