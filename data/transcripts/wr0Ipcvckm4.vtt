00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:25.220 align:start position:0%
start the day uh
 
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
I'm I am headed for my second covid shot
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
at around 11 30 or shortly thereafter
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
which which will leave uh uh a vice
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
chair representative Piemonte to
 
00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
complete the hearings
 
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh that will still be going on at that
 
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.710 align:start position:0%
uh that will still be going on at that
time

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
and uh but I will be back
 
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.170 align:start position:0%
and uh but I will be back
uh

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
and I plan to be in the lob for the
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
executive sessions this afternoon so
 
00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:01.019 align:start position:0%
I will bring Tylenol with me in case in
 
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
case I get a case of the man flu and uh
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
all right so and also today as as you
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
can probably see from the schedule
 
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
between nine and ten thirty we're going
 
00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:23.339 align:start position:0%
to be considering three bills the way
 
00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
they're scheduled is something different
 
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen that this year but I've
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
tried to schedule them all together
 
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
and uh this was uh Heather's
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh effort to try to uh display that but
 
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do let me explain
 
00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
it these these three bills are all very
 
00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:44.030 align:start position:0%
it these these three bills are all very
similar

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:48.180 align:start position:0%
and so uh the intent here from the
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
sponsors is for us to hear all three
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
bills kind of simultaneously
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
and to consider them together because
 
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
the sponsors want to
 
00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:02.459 align:start position:0%
combine them
 
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
into one bill
 
00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:09.260 align:start position:0%
the mechanics of that will be uh 243
 
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
will for lack of a better term will be
 
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
the lead bill
 
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
and the other two 415 and 454 will be
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
Consolidated into 243 uh via amendment
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
that will happen in an executive session
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh and and I believe the amended is
 
00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:33.959 align:start position:0%
available and has been shared uh already
 
00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
with you
 
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
so when you think of these three these
 
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
three bills please think of them
 
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.550 align:start position:0%
three bills please think of them
together

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh because
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
of the sponsors uh is to
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
make sure please make sure you're on
 
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
mute if you're not uh not speaking the
 
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
intent of the sponsors is to be one of
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
these bills and itl the other two so
 
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
that going forward out of our committee
 
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
only one of the three Will Survive
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh to the to the Full House
 
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
uh that one that survives will have
 
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.150 align:start position:0%
uh that one that survives will have
content

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
content
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
of all three
 
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
that hopefully that makes sense to you
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
so as we go through the the hearing
 
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
process we're gonna hear uh about all
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
three of these bills and uh the sponsors
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
are going to tell us how they're going
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
to consolidate uh and try to include it
 
00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:37.019 align:start position:0%
into one and like I said that will that
 
00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:39.380 align:start position:0%
will happen technically through the
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
executive session process when we
 
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
consider an amendment to mechanically
 
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
combine the three bills
 
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.930 align:start position:0%
combine the three bills
and

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:49.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
technically it means that one will
 
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
survive and two will die in an itl
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's if you so vote that way
 
00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.990 align:start position:0%
it's if you so vote that way
uh

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:02.449 --> 00:12:02.459 align:start position:0%
so is there a question to get started uh
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative 11 yes thank you Mr chair
 
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to let you know that my
 
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
personal bodyguard and chauffeur will be
 
00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:12.899 align:start position:0%
at my house at exactly 4 pm
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
to drive me to get my first shot for a
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine so I hope we are finished by
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
then if not I won't be here okay well
 
00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:25.019 align:start position:0%
thanks for the notice I hope I hope we
 
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
are finished by then too and good luck
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
okay the uh Mr chair yeah
 
00:12:35.569 --> 00:12:35.579 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm having trouble hearing back
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
here John can you hear
 
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
yeah it's going in and out a little bit
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
could you just uh speak closer to the
 
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.449 align:start position:0%
could you just uh speak closer to the
microphone

00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:44.459 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
sure thank you is it only me that you're
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
having trouble with
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
yes but let me see if I can adjust my
 
00:12:51.360 --> 00:13:10.190 align:start position:0%
yes but let me see if I can adjust my
volume

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
are there any hints uh from Christina or
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
from uh representative maggiori of how I
 
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
might increase my
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
my volume to help people hear me
 
00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:27.899 align:start position:0%
if Mr chair if you go to the um
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
if you go to your settings you should be
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
able to have the volume or the the
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
volume in Zoom to increase your your mic
 
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.910 align:start position:0%
volume in Zoom to increase your your mic
volume

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
and if down on the bottom where it says
 
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
mute where you have your microphone if
 
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
you hit that little arrow it should
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
bring you to the to the area where you
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
and I think that is in the the settings
 
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
area which is the last
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
um little thingy
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
it's a technical term little thingy on
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
that when we're talking about audio
 
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
meanwhile I uh Mr chair I'm still
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
but Christina is also true she's
 
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:26.200 align:start position:0%
connecting now
 
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:44.090 align:start position:0%
connecting now
[Music]

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.710 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
I've done what I think I can do is that
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
does that help any better did you hear
 
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
me any better
 
00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.150 align:start position:0%
me any better
hmm

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
00:14:53.160 --> 00:15:08.930 align:start position:0%
hmm
little

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
all right if if it continues to be a
 
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
problem with you hearing me
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh please please let me know because
 
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
that means the Public's going to have a
 
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
trouble hearing me as well if they're
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
listening in so uh
 
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
we'll need to make some additional
 
00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.230 align:start position:0%
we'll need to make some additional
adjustments

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair yes
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
um this is a machine over here I'm just
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
going to move that over and maybe that's
 
00:15:38.569 --> 00:15:38.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:40.019 align:start position:0%
I'll jump in to say representative
 
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
I see I have an indication that she's
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
it's going to be hard to control my
 
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:09.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
all right well those who are listening
 
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
or who may be watching please excuse our
 
00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:18.779 align:start position:0%
our technical difficulties we will
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
overcome them very shortly and and move
 
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.710 align:start position:0%
overcome them very shortly and and move
forward

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
he still appears to be on mute for some
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
some reason
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
just Just A Sign Language yes
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh Christina if you're
 
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
monitoring perhaps we can coach uh
 
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman to connect via

on uh HB uh 243
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%

relative to the form of Municipal
 
00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:50.930 align:start position:0%
relative to the form of Municipal
budgets

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh and uh
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna also ask
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative piamonte to give us a
 
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
brief overview of of his approach I
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
tried to explain it to you with the
 
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
three bills but he's going to give a
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
brief over overview and also perhaps he
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
could touch on the history
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
of uh of these measures that were
 
00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
entertained in uh in last year's uh
 
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
session and the votes at the general uh
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
General legislature that that we took
 
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
and I think these bills
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
the intent here was uh went over to the
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
Senate and then it died at covert death
 
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
at that point so representative piamani
 
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:32.220 align:start position:0%
we'll start with you and then we'll go
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
to Wayne gortel
 
00:20:36.409 --> 00:20:36.419 align:start position:0%

all right let's see sorry about that
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
how about now it's better okay
 
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
um this pal we had set this bill up uh
 
00:20:59.450 --> 00:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
last year and it's uh it deals with the
 
00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:02.220 align:start position:0%
municipal budgets for the district and
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
the uh towns
 
00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
now all the budget committees and uh
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
we first actually we
 
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh killed it in the committee and uh
 
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
after talking with the chair and the
 
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
municipal Association uh we came to an
 
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
agreement and
 
00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
we actually flipped it in the house from
 
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
ITA itl to ought to pass uh from there
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
it went to the Senate and it died on the
 
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.909 align:start position:0%
it went to the Senate and it died on the
table

00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
table
 
00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
um so I I made a few additions to this
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
bill this year
 
00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
um basically uh
 
00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
it deals with uh 32-4 five and seven
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
and it's basically the same thing in and
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
it deals with a full line item detail
 
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going to introduce it as
 
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
that right now and yield my time to
 
00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:00.539 align:start position:0%

residents its largest budgets are 35
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars for schools and 21
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars for municipal operations
 
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
uh consider that the school budget alone
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
has over 1 000 accounting lines and is
 
00:23:59.270 --> 00:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
28 printed Pages how can anybody
 
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
efficiently Analyze This budget quite
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
simple you need tools specifically you
 
00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
must have the budget accounting details
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
as an electronic spreadsheet file one
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
which can be loaded into a spreadsheet
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
program like Microsoft Excel and with
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet program you can apply a
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
fusible formulas such as identifying the
 
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
accounting lines that have significant
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
budget changes from the previous year or
 
00:24:23.409 --> 00:24:23.419 align:start position:0%
you could forecast
 
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
expected spending by applying an
 
00:24:27.409 --> 00:24:27.419 align:start position:0%
inflation adjustment to previous
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
spending or you could identify
 
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
accounting lines that have a significant
 
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
difference between the budget request
 
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
and actual past spending so during my
 
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
time on the hooks and budget committee
 
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
we did exactly this to identify budget
 
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
lines with unexpected changes or
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
differences compared to past spending
 
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
and sometimes there were good
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
explanations when there was a large
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
difference uh one year the police budget
 
00:24:54.649 --> 00:24:54.659 align:start position:0%
salary and retirement lines were quite a
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
bit larger than cash spending but this
 
00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
was explained because there were several
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
open positions so passed actual spending
 
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
was for a smaller than desired police
 
00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
force and therefore the budget was
 
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
larger but sometimes budget lines aren't
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
Justified and they might need to get
 
00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.830 align:start position:0%
Justified and they might need to get
adjusted

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
adjusted
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately many taxpayers and even
 
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
budget committee members or governing
 
00:25:18.529 --> 00:25:18.539 align:start position:0%
body members they don't have the
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
capability to look at the budget this
 
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
way many towns and schools do not
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
publish their budgets online they just
 
00:25:27.409 --> 00:25:27.419 align:start position:0%
give elected officials paper copies or
 
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
they're published online but not in a
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
format that can be loaded into a
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet program that's why the
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
language industry standard electronic
 
00:25:36.529 --> 00:25:36.539 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet format is so critical with
 
00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:37.799 align:start position:0%
the spell
 
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
in 2021 Electronics spreadsheet program
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
use is so common it's taught to high
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
school students and many spreadsheet
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
programs are available for free making
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
budget materials available to public in
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
electronic spreadsheet format is long
 
00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.549 align:start position:0%
electronic spreadsheet format is long
overdue

00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
overdue
 
00:25:54.649 --> 00:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
in my written testimony attached to some
 
00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
exhibits uh just examples of how
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
electronic documents are made available
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh by the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
Education my Hooksett school district
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
and the Merrimack Valley School District
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
I encourage your support for this uh
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
soon to be amended 243 the mandates uh
 
00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:13.220 align:start position:0%
critical tools for Budget committees
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
governing bodies and taxpayers so they
 
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
can have an honest and accurate
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
conversation that their governments are
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
budgeting responsibly I appreciate your
 
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
consideration and would be happy to
 
00:26:24.769 --> 00:26:24.779 align:start position:0%
answer any questions are there questions
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
from the committee uh representative
 
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.769 align:start position:0%
from the committee uh representative
treeleven

00:26:30.769 --> 00:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
representative 11 you had your hand up
 
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
yes I did thank you Mr chair it takes a
 
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
minute to unmute with my silly Mouse
 
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr gortel for testifying my
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
question is um who gets to do the data
 
00:26:45.289 --> 00:26:45.299 align:start position:0%
input for these spreadsheets
 
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
the uh the data is produced by
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
um the accounting software that the
 
00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:52.919 align:start position:0%
districts use a lot of them are using
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
Microsoft Excel to create the budget and
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
use that to prepare next budget based on
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
previous budget larger districts have
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
programs that
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
record all these accounting items and
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
put these things together and they all
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
support and Export to something like a
 
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
Microsoft Excel file so
 
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
um this is really how all districts are
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
managing their budgets whether they're
 
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.630 align:start position:0%
managing their budgets whether they're
smaller

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
and uh representative Maggiore just for
 
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
your benefit uh please queue up uh
 
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:21.590 align:start position:0%
your benefit uh please queue up uh
Victoria

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
Victoria
 
00:27:24.049 --> 00:27:24.059 align:start position:0%
Ayre and Donna green as our second and
 
00:27:27.289 --> 00:27:27.299 align:start position:0%
third speakers uh other other questions
 
00:27:27.299 --> 00:27:28.970 align:start position:0%
third speakers uh other other questions
for

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:35.820 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I believe that representative
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
Gallagher had his hand up next okay go
 
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
ahead representative Gallagher
 
00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.529 align:start position:0%
ahead representative Gallagher
so

00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:42.539 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
um asks
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
a tech person and
 
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.310 align:start position:0%
a tech person and
um

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
advocate of the free software movement
 
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.490 align:start position:0%
advocate of the free software movement
wondering

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
um you said like Microsoft Excel is does
 
00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:00.590 align:start position:0%
um you said like Microsoft Excel is does
it

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
um work
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
um just as well with alternate free and
 
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
open source Alternatives is it possible
 
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
to use these data formats without the
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
use of proprietary software or does one
 
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
have to rely on proprietary software
 
00:28:21.169 --> 00:28:21.179 align:start position:0%
written by big corporations
 
00:28:24.049 --> 00:28:24.059 align:start position:0%
to this data thank you representative
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
for your question
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
um what has happened is that because
 
00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
Microsoft Excel is essentially the de
 
00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
facto standard every program whether
 
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
it's a free program like Library office
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
or open office or a proprietary program
 
00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
they can all import this Microsoft Excel
 
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
format it's because they were the first
 
00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
big program that's kind of become the de
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
facto standard in my written testimony I
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
attached an example of the Department of
 
00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:48.179 align:start position:0%
Education website they actually make the
 
00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
data available in two formats so comma
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
separated values is just a file that you
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
can load into any one of these
 
00:28:56.529 --> 00:28:56.539 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet programs or Microsoft Excel
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of a member of the
 
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
public or school board or or budget
 
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
committee these are the same so comma
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
separated value or Microsoft Excel file
 
00:29:09.529 --> 00:29:09.539 align:start position:0%
any program can import these files
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
because they are standards and I think
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
doe did a good job making both available
 
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
uh Mr gertel uh this is uh
 
00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan uh is it um
 
00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
the correct Assumption of my part that
 
00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:24.860 align:start position:0%
you're using
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
Excel as a generic term much the way I
 
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
might say to somebody go make me a Xerox
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
copy of a document and I'm not really
 
00:29:36.529 --> 00:29:36.539 align:start position:0%
telling them to use a xerox machine I'm
 
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
just telling them to make a copy and
 
00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:40.700 align:start position:0%
whatever copy machine brand that we have
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair it's very similar to
 
00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.090 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair it's very similar to
that

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
um I think the one difference that's
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
very critical here is most of the
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
documents you see published on the web
 
00:29:51.529 --> 00:29:51.539 align:start position:0%
might be in what's called a portable
 
00:29:54.289 --> 00:29:54.299 align:start position:0%
document format or PDF and that looks
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
pretty I can run that through my printer
 
00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:58.140 align:start position:0%
and it looks lovely but I can't actually
 
00:30:00.529 --> 00:30:00.539 align:start position:0%
do these spreadsheet calculations on PDF
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
documents so when we say a Microsoft
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
Excel file or a CSV file that
 
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:08.039 align:start position:0%
specifically defines a file that you can
 
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
load into a spreadsheet program so you
 
00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
can do these kind of math functions I
 
00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:13.799 align:start position:0%
described thank you representative
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.210 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question if um
 
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
these documents are made available in
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
this format could a member of the public
 
00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
then go in and change figures in the
 
00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.510 align:start position:0%
then go in and change figures in the
documents

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
documents
 
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
or is it um or are they
 
00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.149 align:start position:0%
or is it um or are they
non-editable

00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
non-editable
 
00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for your
 
00:30:39.659 --> 00:30:40.549 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for your
question

00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
um by requiring these documents to be
 
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
posted online
 
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
essentially you guard against that
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
protection so anyone can pull a copy
 
00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:48.950 align:start position:0%
protection so anyone can pull a copy
down

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:30:51.409 --> 00:30:51.419 align:start position:0%
um in my written test 20 I I provided an
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
example of the Merrimack Valley School
 
00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.070 align:start position:0%
example of the Merrimack Valley School
District's

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
District's
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
um spreadsheet so you can edit that and
 
00:30:59.210 --> 00:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
look at it and you could do hypothetical
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
things but if anyone in the public wants
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
to see what the real copy is they just
 
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:04.980 align:start position:0%
go to their school district's website or
 
00:31:06.649 --> 00:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
their their towns website and get that
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
copy so the ability to edit the files
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
allows the public or budget committee
 
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
members to do analysis or add formulas
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
or or things like that
 
00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
um but the body that owns the document
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
essentially posts on their website and
 
00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
everyone can go there for the real copy
 
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
I hope that answers your question I
 
00:31:27.889 --> 00:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
would like a follow-up please follow up
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
so so it would be possible for me to
 
00:31:33.889 --> 00:31:33.899 align:start position:0%
download it on my computer and and play
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
with the numbers if I wanted to and then
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
I could upload my copy into the onto the
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
internet on a Facebook page
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
would that could that happen that could
 
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
happen and if anyone uh just trusted
 
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
that upload they could go to the
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
um governing body site or whoever
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
published the document and obtain the
 
00:31:57.409 --> 00:31:57.419 align:start position:0%
real copy how would they know
 
00:31:59.450 --> 00:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
uh they would simply know that there's a
 
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
copy published I think it's kind of
 
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
similar to getting a copy of uh the
 
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
local newspaper and here's the copy
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
versus a edited picture that I posted on
 
00:32:09.409 --> 00:32:09.419 align:start position:0%
Facebook you can always find the
 
00:32:12.529 --> 00:32:12.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.409 --> 00:32:15.419 align:start position:0%
okay uh next we have a question from
 
00:32:18.409 --> 00:32:18.419 align:start position:0%
representative man chaputi
 
00:32:21.649 --> 00:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr ortal
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question isn't it true
 
00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
that this uh software is tied into the
 
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
accounting software that the uh
 
00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
City or School District or the
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities use so that there is a
 
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
seamless transfer of one and uh from one
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
to another
 
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
also isn't that the
 
00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:51.950 align:start position:0%
also isn't that the
protection

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:32:54.909 --> 00:32:54.919 align:start position:0%
want that the security
 
00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
of for the school budget or the town
 
00:33:00.529 --> 00:33:00.539 align:start position:0%
budget committee to have that security
 
00:33:03.889 --> 00:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
when they have paid
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh software that they're using
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:09.830 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
question

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:10.909 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:33:10.909 --> 00:33:10.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:12.769 --> 00:33:12.779 align:start position:0%
I think there's sort of three scenarios
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
here um for I think smaller towns uh
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
schools Etc they're probably using a
 
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
product like Microsoft Excel to put
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
their budget lines together and edit
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
them year to year to forecast their
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
their next proposed budget um larger
 
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
districts use
 
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
um more complicated software but because
 
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
CSV and Microsoft Excel are sort of the
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
two standards they can export that in in
 
00:33:36.289 --> 00:33:36.299 align:start position:0%
my district for instance there's a large
 
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
program that's used and it's exported to
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
Excel and the business administrator
 
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
adds information to it to make the copy
 
00:33:46.009 --> 00:33:46.019 align:start position:0%
that is given to the the school board so
 
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
um ultimately the the data is correct
 
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
and it's just transferred to a new form
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
that that can be used by the public or
 
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:08.169 align:start position:0%
 
same

00:34:08.169 --> 00:34:08.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
I was muted and lost all audio
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry about that we have a next
 
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
question from Representatives Davis
 
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:34:25.369 --> 00:34:25.379 align:start position:0%
I I have a question about the term
 
00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
industry standard
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
who who decides what is the industry
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
standard what if the industry standard
 
00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:34.250 align:start position:0%
standard what if the industry standard
changes

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
a year from now I mean whoever knows
 
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
what it is uh I have a business in which
 
00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:42.839 align:start position:0%
I do not use Microsoft Excel I use a
 
00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:44.659 align:start position:0%
different kind of spreadsheet
 
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
which is fully shareable with my
 
00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:48.609 align:start position:0%
which is fully shareable with my
partners

00:34:48.609 --> 00:34:48.619 align:start position:0%
partners
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
who can make changes and do analyzes on
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
it for me and for us that's the industry
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
standard so who who is the decider about
 
00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
what the industry standard is in this
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:05.220 align:start position:0%
question B
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
um I think that is a challenging aspect
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
of this kind of testimony as I mentioned
 
00:35:13.089 --> 00:35:13.099 align:start position:0%
your previous question there's really
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
two types of files there is something
 
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
that you can print and looks pretty and
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
there's a type that can be used for a
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet program uh so you can
 
00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
actually run calculations and do
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
analysis I would guarantee that whatever
 
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
program you're using even though it's
 
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
not Microsoft Excel allows you to import
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
data from a CSV file or a Microsoft
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
Excel file so
 
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
um again these are these have become
 
00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
standard just because they're the most
 
00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:41.220 align:start position:0%
popular programs the CSV format isn't
 
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
owned by anybody per se it is the public
 
00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
format so that's the way it's really
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
just a list of numbers with commas
 
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
between them and any program that needs
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
to have data imported you can get that
 
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
format so
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
you could say CSV I think legislation
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
um industry standard I think gives more
 
00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
flexibility and the uh exhibit from the
 
00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
Department of Education I provided I
 
00:36:04.609 --> 00:36:04.619 align:start position:0%
think really hits the the mark there
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
with making all three file formats
 
00:36:06.599 --> 00:36:08.750 align:start position:0%
with making all three file formats
available

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
you muted Mr chair I was muted uh next
 
00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh Mr chair and um actually
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
I have a a question for you
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
um in reviewing uh Mr gortel's testimony
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
and listening to Tim speaking I I also
 
00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
was looking at the um Amendment
 
00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:36:43.849 --> 00:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
my um my comment is actually as much to
 
00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
the amendment and I don't know if that
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate at this time or
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
should I be waiting yeah I I would uh I
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
would suggest that we wait until we get
 
00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
to an executive session before we
 
00:36:56.329 --> 00:36:56.339 align:start position:0%
consider the amendment the content of
 
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment just with the
 
00:36:59.930 --> 00:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
understanding that the sponsors want to
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
use the amendment process to consolidate
 
00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine then I just do have a
 
00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
really um quick kind of question for uh
 
00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
Mr gortel if that's okay
 
00:37:14.089 --> 00:37:14.099 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr gortel
 
00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
I'm one of these people who um I'm a a
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
numbers person and I like having CSV
 
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
files myself so um I completely
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
understand that but I also
 
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
um want to follow up with a question
 
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
that um one of the previous uh speakers
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
had asked and that was about the ability
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
of being able to manipulate a document
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
and then put it up on social media and I
 
00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
agree with what you say the the original
 
00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
one will always remain there but Mike my
 
00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:47.700 align:start position:0%
question to you is
 
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
aren't we also concerned that um the
 
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
original poster that may have changed
 
00:37:56.089 --> 00:37:56.099 align:start position:0%
these documents to create some type of
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
tomfoolery or or someone like that
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
um that will become the live document in
 
00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
the Public's mind
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
um and not necessarily that if we allow
 
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
um editable but I at the same time I'm
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
saying this I do agree with
 
00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
um the the right of being able to do
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
much of what you had said but do you not
 
00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:20.099 align:start position:0%
have concerns that this could happen as
 
00:38:20.099 --> 00:38:21.109 align:start position:0%
have concerns that this could happen as
well

00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.569 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
question

00:38:23.569 --> 00:38:23.579 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm personally not concerned and and
 
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
the reason for this is because you
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
always can find the original copy
 
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:31.140 align:start position:0%
um maybe a better analogy than the
 
00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
newspaper one I offered before was if
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
you were to have a post on on social
 
00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
media and then someone would just say
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative said this and and messed
 
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
that up someone could always go to your
 
00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
social media page and see what you
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
actually said so
 
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
um I think with any kind of
 
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:49.380 align:start position:0%
communication you sort of have the game
 
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
a telephone where things could be taken
 
00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
over context or misconstrued or
 
00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.069 align:start position:0%
over context or misconstrued or
intentionally

00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:55.079 align:start position:0%
intentionally
 
00:38:58.849 --> 00:38:58.859 align:start position:0%
um uh stated incorrectly but the ability
 
00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
to post these and know who was the
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
source of record and go to that location
 
00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
to find in this case the budget
 
00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet you always have the accurate
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
copy and I think that quickly
 
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.849 align:start position:0%
copy and I think that quickly
um

00:39:09.849 --> 00:39:09.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
stifles any sort of um misuse of a
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
document to make or whether it's a
 
00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:17.099 align:start position:0%
social media post or whatever
 
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
um someone can simply say that's
 
00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
incorrect the copy on the school's
 
00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
website says this is the amount we spent
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
on teacher salaries last year you're
 
00:39:26.089 --> 00:39:26.099 align:start position:0%
incorrect so I think these kind of
 
00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
things um you know we see examples in
 
00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
other areas in social media today but
 
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
you can always find the original quote
 
00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
or the original posting and and see the
 
00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
truth that way so I think it's it's not
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
really any different from other
 
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
situations we have today
 
00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair yes
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh this is representative Tripp may I
 
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
ask a question
 
00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:55.790 align:start position:0%
ask a question
uh

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:58.849 --> 00:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
let me uh oh you're in the uh you're in
 
00:39:58.859 --> 00:39:59.870 align:start position:0%
let me uh oh you're in the uh you're in
the

00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
the lob so I can't I can't uh see you uh
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a problem no yes it is
 
00:40:07.079 --> 00:40:07.849 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a problem no yes it is
um

00:40:07.849 --> 00:40:07.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
so perhaps we're being discriminated
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
against I know so so perhaps I could ask
 
00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
representative medjury if there is a
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
member in the lob that raises their hand
 
00:40:19.609 --> 00:40:19.619 align:start position:0%
that I can't see because I only can see
 
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
electronic hands could you please uh let
 
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
make me aware that there is somebody in
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
the LLB that wishes to speak as well
 
00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:29.339 align:start position:0%
I'll do that and as a follow-up Mr chair
 
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
I would just say that
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
um maybe if that representative could
 
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
physically wave their hands so I can see
 
00:40:38.089 --> 00:40:38.099 align:start position:0%
them and I'll make a note as best I can
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
well that's right you're not you're not
 
00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
in the lb either I was I thought you
 
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
were there uh representative Powell
 
00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:47.339 align:start position:0%
you're in the are you in the lob yes yes
 
00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
could you uh with you are you uh are you
 
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
a in a designed assistant right now for
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
the meeting yes I am all right so why
 
00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
don't you
 
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
um as you look around the room and see
 
00:41:02.569 --> 00:41:02.579 align:start position:0%
one of the members in the lob with their
 
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
hand up that wants to speak could you
 
00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
please indicate to me because that's
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's a disadvantage from
 
00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative Maggiore because he's
 
00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
like me he's only can see the electronic
 
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
hands raised yes I will do that thank
 
00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.730 align:start position:0%
hands raised yes I will do that thank
you

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
so let let me go make I'm trying to do
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
this in the right order so I want to go
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
to representative Maggie or he was a
 
00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.589 align:start position:0%
to representative Maggie or he was a
question

00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and and thank you Mr
 
00:41:28.609 --> 00:41:28.619 align:start position:0%
gottel for taking my question
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
um my question is going to be about
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement and and the background or
 
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
penalties in the background for full
 
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
disclosure the town of Northampton has
 
00:41:40.849 --> 00:41:40.859 align:start position:0%
for many years provided the budget
 
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
committee with the exact form and format
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
that you are suggesting
 
00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:49.820 align:start position:0%
um and as as I'm sure everybody is aware
 
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
when after the select board has reviewed
 
00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
the budget it transfers that budget the
 
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
approved select board budget to the
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
official budget committee that's what we
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
do and then it's theirs
 
00:42:08.569 --> 00:42:08.579 align:start position:0%
um so I'm so my question is the budget
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
committee then will be suggesting
 
00:42:14.569 --> 00:42:14.579 align:start position:0%
um to the governing body that the
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
updates to the budget be posted online
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
well actually there's two questions here
 
00:42:23.569 --> 00:42:23.579 align:start position:0%
so what if we forget or don't do it
 
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
um during that that high that intense
 
00:42:28.609 --> 00:42:28.619 align:start position:0%
period of of budget season uh we we just
 
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
that the town has forgotten to do it is
 
00:42:32.569 --> 00:42:32.579 align:start position:0%
there an enforcement or a penalty issue
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
here and
 
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
um are you would you be suggesting that
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
there should be some notation here that
 
00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:41.060 align:start position:0%
this is the budget committee
 
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
recommendation or School Board
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation and not the
 
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
recommendation or not the update from
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
the select board to eliminate some
 
00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
appreciate the questions
 
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
um I think regarding who's budget it is
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
you're correct there's there's
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
definitely a transition of ownership the
 
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:05.220 align:start position:0%
administrative body uh sorry the
 
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
administration proposes a budget
 
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
typically it goes to the governing body
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
they amend the budget so that points the
 
00:43:13.609 --> 00:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
governing body's budget and then if it's
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
an sb2 channel it's transferred to the
 
00:43:17.569 --> 00:43:17.579 align:start position:0%
budget committee and it's their budget
 
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
and ultimately they have a public
 
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
hearing and
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh the deliberative session on that
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
budget so
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
um speaking from my experience in
 
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
hooksettes we have five governing bodies
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
um water precincts uh Wastewater School
 
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:32.460 align:start position:0%
in town
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
what effectively happens is the
 
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
administration is managing that budget
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the process so governing body
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
makes adjustments their Administration
 
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
obviously is is updating the budget at
 
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:46.140 align:start position:0%
some point it's given to the budget
 
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
committee the budget Community makes
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
updates so there's there's motions and
 
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
votes and and they're tweaking lines or
 
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
or the bottom line and what's happening
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
is essentially you've got two bodies
 
00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
checking each other's work so the budget
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
committee has a running total your
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
Administration is running total
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
in Hooksett ultimately your
 
00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
Administration is taking the amended
 
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
budget and putting it in the handbook
 
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
for uh the public hearing or for the
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions so
 
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
you essentially have dual ownership at
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
that point you are corrected as budget
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
committee's budget presented to the
 
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
public uh I haven't seen a lot of
 
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
examples of the budget committee
 
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:26.220 align:start position:0%
publishing their spreadsheet uh we've
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
done that in hooks up in the past but
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
typically uh the folks who spend the
 
00:44:31.849 --> 00:44:31.859 align:start position:0%
money are most interested in making sure
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
all those Publications occur
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
answered your question
 
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.410 align:start position:0%
answered your question
um

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:38.329 --> 00:44:38.339 align:start position:0%
you had two and I think I only answered
 
00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
one yes thank you very much and the
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
second question was do you anticipate uh
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
any type of enforcement and or penalty
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
should for some reason this this
 
00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
um this amendment says shall and for
 
00:44:54.829 --> 00:44:54.839 align:start position:0%
some reason we do not by and let's
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
assume that that is just human error and
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
not intentional but it is not done and
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
then the public feels disenfranchised do
 
00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
you anticipate or does anybody
 
00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:05.579 align:start position:0%
anticipate any possible enforcement or
 
00:45:05.579 --> 00:45:07.670 align:start position:0%
anticipate any possible enforcement or
penalties

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.809 align:start position:0%
penalties
um

00:45:08.809 --> 00:45:08.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
so RSA 32 doesn't really have a lot in
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
the um penalties section uh there's a
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
few few examples uh for
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh light I'll basically I'll call it
 
00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
late negligence that mean gross
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
negligence and if memory service correct
 
00:45:26.089 --> 00:45:26.099 align:start position:0%
I think that capsided perhaps say uh
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
there was litigation involved a one or
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollar penalty
 
00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
um and again that's gross litigation
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
which I I'm not aware has actually ever
 
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.010 align:start position:0%
which I I'm not aware has actually ever
been

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
um brought about
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
um I I think Simply Having the
 
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
legislation goes a long way because
 
00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:41.220 align:start position:0%
um it is the guideline you're supposed
 
00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
to follow and what IT addresses at least
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
in my perspective is is there is such a
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
variability in in how these things are
 
00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
produced today in the public in many
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
places doesn't have a chance to see the
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
budget so the fact that you've specified
 
00:45:56.089 --> 00:45:56.099 align:start position:0%
this approach to making the data
 
00:45:56.099 --> 00:45:57.470 align:start position:0%
this approach to making the data
available

00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:45:59.809 --> 00:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
um I think that we'll optimistically
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
bring everybody around to
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
um being very transparent or forthcoming
 
00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:08.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.770 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
our next speaker we're going to go to uh
 
00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:13.859 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp and then
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher with questions
 
00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
but before we do that
 
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
um I representative Clee brought up an
 
00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
issue about uh the amendment and uh it's
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding that the the other
 
00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
bills of this Trifecta here uh
 
00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:34.700 align:start position:0%
415 and four four
 
00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
54 on May
 
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
answer those the questions that uh the
 
00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
amendment might try to solve it I may
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully I have that correct so I'm
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
going to ask Mr gortel to
 
00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:49.740 align:start position:0%
confirm whether I'm correct or not
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you yes um I I see this
 
00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
as a package and those other two bills
 
00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:56.030 align:start position:0%
as a package and those other two bills
um

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
the first one we talked about in my
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
testimonies primarily around the the
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
details that are published
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
um the other two bills specifically
 
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.790 align:start position:0%
um the other two bills specifically
address

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
it's getting published and being
 
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
available for the public in a useful
 
00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
format and then a very small change to
 
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
the language that essentially makes
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
budget committees on par with governing
 
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
bodies and I can talk to that for those
 
00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
bills but
 
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:20.220 align:start position:0%
um yeah I see them partnered up and
 
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
together providing a good solution
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm gonna next go to
 
00:47:26.089 --> 00:47:26.099 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp and then we'll go
 
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
to representative Gallagher
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
same sorts of a lot of concern about
 
00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:39.470 align:start position:0%
same sorts of a lot of concern about
people

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:47:41.569 --> 00:47:41.579 align:start position:0%
changing the uh these files and then
 
00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:43.740 align:start position:0%
putting them on social media or
 
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
something like that uh
 
00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
seems that uh
 
00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
this is the only concern that people
 
00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
have about uh
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
changing files and then completing them
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
Mr gottel are you familiar with PDF
 
00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.750 align:start position:0%
Mr gottel are you familiar with PDF
editors

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
editors
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
I am yes
 
00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
do you think that uh people can download
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
files from
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
PDF files from a
 
00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
School site change them and then repost
 
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.670 align:start position:0%
School site change them and then repost
them

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question I think
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
there's really two situations here um so
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
a PDF can be signed and and that is
 
00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to make it tamper-proof and so
 
00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:28.140 align:start position:0%
for the budget being published in a in a
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
very pretty format you would perhaps
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
print out or scroll through online I
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
think that's a way to lock down the
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
official you know governing body
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
published budget or budget committee
 
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
budget so I think it makes sense to have
 
00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
that publish in the website the CSV or
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
Microsoft Excel file format that that we
 
00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
see many districts publish that's really
 
00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
a tool to allow people to to apply
 
00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
formulas and do some what-if questioning
 
00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
and such
 
00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:56.220 align:start position:0%
um I think your signed PDF as as the
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
budgeted record on a website really
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
addresses that problem because it's not
 
00:49:01.609 --> 00:49:01.619 align:start position:0%
going to be manipulated so new delhi's
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
Point people to that document
 
00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
I love people
 
00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh representative tripty did I hear you
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
ask for a follow-up
 
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not so much concerned about uh
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
the the actual pretty uh budget theme
 
00:49:29.569 --> 00:49:29.579 align:start position:0%
changed I think that uh
 
00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:32.579 align:start position:0%
the problem is that people aren't aware
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
that this can happen you know they
 
00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:38.339 align:start position:0%
they're very concerned about the CSV
 
00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
files being changed and and being
 
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
reposted whereas uh it is possible
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
uh that uh the PDF files can be changed
 
00:49:48.119 --> 00:49:50.030 align:start position:0%
uh that uh the PDF files can be changed
so

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
I guess why is there extreme concern
 
00:49:58.970 --> 00:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:01.609 --> 00:50:01.619 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I I think
 
00:50:05.329 --> 00:50:05.339 align:start position:0%
the Cs V again is we're really using two
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
different programs the PDF allows anyone
 
00:50:08.569 --> 00:50:08.579 align:start position:0%
to view it you can view it in a web
 
00:50:08.579 --> 00:50:09.710 align:start position:0%
to view it you can view it in a web
browser

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
browser
 
00:50:11.569 --> 00:50:11.579 align:start position:0%
um you can view it a PDF editor and and
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
that can be a signed document the the
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
other files you can actually sign an MS
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
Excel file but a CSV it's just a list of
 
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
numbers uh or a giant table of numbers
 
00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
um and I think ultimately you've got the
 
00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:23.210 align:start position:0%
um and I think ultimately you've got the
same

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:23.220 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
your challenge is no different than uh
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
we could have this meeting this morning
 
00:50:29.329 --> 00:50:29.339 align:start position:0%
and and representative pick a comment
 
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
and then I can post an incorrect summary
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
of that comment on social media and
 
00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:34.980 align:start position:0%
someone says no that's you know go see
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
the original comment Mr vertel was
 
00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:38.579 align:start position:0%
incorrect it's the same thing with the
 
00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
budget data um I think that
 
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
yeah there is no way to I mean any any
 
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
data you get that's that's public you
 
00:50:51.049 --> 00:50:51.059 align:start position:0%
can pull onto your computer and edit so
 
00:50:53.089 --> 00:50:53.099 align:start position:0%
really we're just looking forward these
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
um additional bills that have to be
 
00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:56.700 align:start position:0%
posted and I think the the governing
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
body or whoever posting these you always
 
00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:00.780 align:start position:0%
have the gold copy there so I think the
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
questions about someone posting an
 
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
incorrect copy are are really addressed
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
by just go to this place and look for
 
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
the real copy
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
okay next speaker or a questioner will
 
00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
be representative Gallagher and then
 
00:51:15.049 --> 00:51:15.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:15.059 --> 00:51:16.609 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:16.619 --> 00:51:17.510 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
on the line of this whole uh discussion
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
about different versions of
 
00:51:24.599 --> 00:51:26.569 align:start position:0%
about different versions of
budgets

00:51:26.569 --> 00:51:26.579 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if it would be
 
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
possible under this legislation
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
for towns to use a GitHub style
 
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
development model for their budgets
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
where the budget is stored in a Version
 
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
Control System
 
00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
um and then each version of it is
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
identified by a unique commit hash and
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
then changes to it are required to be
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
done in the form of poll requests so
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:52:01.079 --> 00:52:01.970 align:start position:0%
um that
um

00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:05.329 --> 00:52:05.339 align:start position:0%
people that different versions are
 
00:52:08.089 --> 00:52:08.099 align:start position:0%
people's other versions are easily
 
00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:12.300 align:start position:0%
identified as such and people can
 
00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:14.809 align:start position:0%
identified as such and people can
see

00:52:14.809 --> 00:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
who it's coming from and how it would
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
get merged in
 
00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
uh representative thank you for your
 
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
question I'm actually a computer
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
software developer uh by trade and so I
 
00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:26.700 align:start position:0%
know exactly what you're talking about I
 
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
think that would set a bar that would be
 
00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
too high for for some
 
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
municipalities or governing bodies to to
 
00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:34.740 align:start position:0%
follow just because there is a learning
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
curve it's not your standard web hosting
 
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
blog to give an example and I think uh
 
00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
another uh representative had this
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
question about versioning so
 
00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
um what hooksett's town government does
 
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
is they'll post the the MS Excel
 
00:52:50.809 --> 00:52:50.819 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet on its website and there's a
 
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
date on it so the Excel file or the PDF
 
00:52:56.329 --> 00:52:56.339 align:start position:0%
file has a date it's it's version two as
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
of January 7th 2021 if the budget
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
Community makes additional changes they
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
simply remove that version publish the
 
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
latest version with an updated date and
 
00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:07.670 align:start position:0%
latest version with an updated date and
so

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
um although you could have a bunch of
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
different versions really all that
 
00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:13.500 align:start position:0%
matters is the current version because
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
that's the sum of all the amendments to
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
date and then the version that um is
 
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:20.220 align:start position:0%
used to produce the budget going to
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
public hearing and Global Obsession so I
 
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate this very good question I
 
00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:26.099 align:start position:0%
think that simply putting a comment and
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
even the file with a version and a date
 
00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
addresses that question is probably from
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
my perspective the most efficient and
 
00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
simple way for for
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
um governing bodies and such to comply
 
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:40.910 align:start position:0%
with this bill
representative

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
um just going back to the different
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
versions and different uh software and
 
00:53:53.569 --> 00:53:53.579 align:start position:0%
stuff what is the stamp for the cyber
 
00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
security I mean these are accounting
 
00:53:58.569 --> 00:53:58.579 align:start position:0%
these are Preparatory
 
00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:03.980 align:start position:0%
documents of you know how safe are
 
00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:07.140 align:start position:0%
municipalities in cities in the school
 
00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
boards to have this kind of
 
00:54:16.849 --> 00:54:16.859 align:start position:0%
cyber security not being tampered
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
00:54:20.089 --> 00:54:20.099 align:start position:0%
representative I I think it's very
 
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
similar to a school publishing
 
00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
um and I don't want to oversimplify but
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
publishing like a lunch menu or
 
00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.049 align:start position:0%
publishing like a lunch menu or
something

00:54:27.049 --> 00:54:27.059 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
um the website
 
00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:31.140 align:start position:0%
you know you specify a document can be
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
retrieved from your website and random
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
people can't change your lunch menu for
 
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
your school or they can't upload
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
documents because the website has been
 
00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
set up so only people have permission
 
00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
only certain people have permission to
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
post so the actual posting the documents
 
00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
and I think that's that's more covered
 
00:54:51.049 --> 00:54:51.059 align:start position:0%
by um one of the other related bills is
 
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
addressed simply by
 
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
any anyone that has a website page or a
 
00:54:57.650 --> 00:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
Facebook page or something specifies who
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
has permission to do what the actual
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
document is is really no different
 
00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:05.220 align:start position:0%
um I could go today to my town and issue
 
00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
rights no request and get a paper copy
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
or get this file personally so
 
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
I think the the related bills that talk
 
00:55:14.809 --> 00:55:14.819 align:start position:0%
about publishing this in a website
 
00:55:17.329 --> 00:55:17.339 align:start position:0%
actually make the process safer because
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
anyone in the public can go to the
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
website and say Here's the budget
 
00:55:22.849 --> 00:55:22.859 align:start position:0%
published by the budget committee if if
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
you're not publishing this and someone
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
gets a copy by write to no request and
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
posts it there's nowhere to look and
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
confirm if this has been been modified
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
or not so I think the related bill that
 
00:55:35.329 --> 00:55:35.339 align:start position:0%
says it should be published
 
00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:36.839 align:start position:0%
um really solves a problem because
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
there's one place to go for the for the
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
real official copy uh follow Mr chair
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
um I understand uh I'm married to a
 
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
software engineer who has worked on the
 
00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:52.140 align:start position:0%
cyber security and uh
 
00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
you know software uh
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
of 40 plus years so what my question is
 
00:56:02.809 --> 00:56:02.819 align:start position:0%
I understand this is where the 21st
 
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
century this is the way to go this is
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
the way to do it but on the same token
 
00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
in the back end
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
that is also an investment that our
 
00:56:15.049 --> 00:56:15.059 align:start position:0%
municipalities school boards and staff
 
00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
which we have to do virtually and to
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
have that back-end safety
 
00:56:25.609 --> 00:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
that also has to be not just one
 
00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
software that's for publishing and
 
00:56:32.329 --> 00:56:32.339 align:start position:0%
website and uh but also security we're
 
00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
talking about budget
 
00:56:38.089 --> 00:56:38.099 align:start position:0%
so tampering that there should be a
 
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I
 
00:56:47.809 --> 00:56:47.819 align:start position:0%
um I think there's really sort of three
 
00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:50.220 align:start position:0%
scales to to how these things are posted
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
and I think we're talking about the
 
00:56:53.089 --> 00:56:53.099 align:start position:0%
related bills at this point but
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
um for instance I have a little website
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
gorgehog.com I have like 20 Pages there
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
as a school board member I've posted
 
00:57:01.849 --> 00:57:01.859 align:start position:0%
some letters to the editors and things I
 
00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
spend ten dollars a month for this to be
 
00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
hosted and there's a administrative
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
access that says I can post and nobody
 
00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
else can so obviously Manchester has a
 
00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
very different uh town website but they
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
do a similar thing with with granting
 
00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
access and there's of course
 
00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:18.829 align:start position:0%
access and there's of course
um

00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
municipalities between the size of my
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
little website in Manchester so Food
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
flavors but they all have these
 
00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
fundamental access controls as part of
 
00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
publishing so
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
um you know I think perhaps there's a
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
larger question here about
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
ensuring municipalities are taking
 
00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
appropriate cyber protections I I
 
00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:37.140 align:start position:0%
personally think that's to be on the
 
00:57:38.569 --> 00:57:38.579 align:start position:0%
scope of this bill this is really
 
00:57:40.609 --> 00:57:40.619 align:start position:0%
getting at the budget
 
00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
um which is being examined by governing
 
00:57:45.049 --> 00:57:45.059 align:start position:0%
body budget committee and and such
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
should be available for the public and
 
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
if it's posted online you know the real
 
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
copy is online at a website if anyone
 
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
can go get it and that sort of
 
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
guarantees that everyone knows what the
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
real real budget is I hope it answered
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
your question
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you our next question will come
 
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
from representative Gilman then a second
 
00:58:05.089 --> 00:58:05.099 align:start position:0%
question from representative Matt giorg
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I apologize for
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
having uh computer problems in the
 
00:58:09.839 --> 00:58:10.910 align:start position:0%
having uh computer problems in the
beginning

00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
um but for the record I am in my room
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
alone in Exeter
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
um my question is would the
 
00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:21.170 align:start position:0%
um my question is would the
uh

00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:22.730 align:start position:0%
uh
access

00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:22.740 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:26.900 align:start position:0%
to a line item budget be adequate if the
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
administration scans it and publishes
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
publishes it as a PDF that way as
 
00:58:35.329 --> 00:58:35.339 align:start position:0%
opposed to a a live PDF that can be
 
00:58:35.339 --> 00:58:37.010 align:start position:0%
opposed to a a live PDF that can be
edited

00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
edited
 
00:58:38.329 --> 00:58:38.339 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
00:58:38.339 --> 00:58:39.230 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
question

00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
um what I'm looking as a budget
 
00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
Committee Member um very specifically I
 
00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
think you need both both versions so the
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
scanned copy that's made available as a
 
00:58:49.849 --> 00:58:49.859 align:start position:0%
PDF you can publish that and people can
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
see the budget but again consider
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
Hooksett a thousand lines for its school
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
budget you really can't look through 28
 
00:58:58.370 --> 00:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
pages and say what are the lines that
 
00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
changed a lot um you really need a tool
 
00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:02.220 align:start position:0%
that's sort of like asking your auto
 
00:59:05.089 --> 00:59:05.099 align:start position:0%
mechanic to to do repair without tools
 
00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:07.140 align:start position:0%
um these these budgets are so large a
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet program is being used to
 
00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
create them uh if you want to ask some
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
of these fundamental questions you do
 
00:59:14.569 --> 00:59:14.579 align:start position:0%
need it in a format that that can be
 
00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
loaded into a spreadsheet so
 
00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the scan copy you can't
 
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:19.740 align:start position:0%
load into a spreadsheet program and you
 
00:59:21.049 --> 00:59:21.059 align:start position:0%
can't ask them these questions and
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately my experience on on budget
 
00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:23.990 align:start position:0%
unfortunately my experience on on budget
committee

00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
um some years where we had this data we
 
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
could do some really good work um one
 
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
year which I I described in my written
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
testimony we were denied access to these
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
public documents and it made the job a
 
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
lot harder
 
00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
and can I have a follow-up Mr chair yes
 
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
you can
 
00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:41.210 align:start position:0%
you can
um

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:41.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
what was my follow-up sorry I've
 
00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
forgotten what I was going to ask on uh
 
00:59:49.809 --> 00:59:49.819 align:start position:0%
well just uh think about it we'll go to
 
00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative Maggiore thank you
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
goetel for taking a second question uh
 
01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm thinking about uh fist being I'm
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
thinking about economies in different
 
01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
communities as they may have been
 
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
affected or or they just are as as they
 
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
exist so please don't take this question
 
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
as being snarky it's not intended to be
 
01:00:16.849 --> 01:00:16.859 align:start position:0%
but can you please define the the limits
 
01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question so uh one of
 
01:00:27.049 --> 01:00:27.059 align:start position:0%
the related bills uh published online
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
and and I think that's
 
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:30.470 align:start position:0%
and and I think that's
um

01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
on on a municipalities website for
 
01:00:35.569 --> 01:00:35.579 align:start position:0%
instance uh in the in the written
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
testimony provides some examples you can
 
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
go to a page of documents on hooksettes
 
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
School Board site and and see the
 
01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet uh Merrimack Valley just
 
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:45.780 align:start position:0%
drops the entire spreadsheet in a page
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
and you could actually look scroll
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
through it there without with any
 
01:00:50.809 --> 01:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
difficulty uh the Department of
 
01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:53.780 align:start position:0%
Education just has these data pages and
 
01:00:56.809 --> 01:00:56.819 align:start position:0%
whichever version you want a PDF file a
 
01:00:59.089 --> 01:00:59.099 align:start position:0%
CSV or or Ms Excel you can just download
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
your computer and pop open
 
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
um so I think publishing is is somewhat
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
big but online is it's 2021 I think
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
online is where people go to to get
 
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
these documents
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
okay next uh I want to bring in uh Miss
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
Victoria Ayer who wants to you can
 
01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:23.569 align:start position:0%
Victoria Ayer who wants to you can
support

01:01:23.569 --> 01:01:23.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
good morning can you hear me yes go
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
right ahead
 
01:01:29.569 --> 01:01:29.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you members of
 
01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
the committee I think Mr gartel summed
 
01:01:35.569 --> 01:01:35.579 align:start position:0%
it up quite nicely and it'll make my
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
testimony quite a bit shorter I did want
 
01:01:42.289 --> 01:01:42.299 align:start position:0%
to touch upon one comment though I can
 
01:01:44.569 --> 01:01:44.579 align:start position:0%
already produce any spreadsheet I could
 
01:01:46.849 --> 01:01:46.859 align:start position:0%
produce a spreadsheet of a budget detail
 
01:01:49.809 --> 01:01:49.819 align:start position:0%
for either one of you and post it online
 
01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
just because
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
I can do that doesn't mean I'm going to
 
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
do that so I just wanted to make that
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
comment that it's something that can
 
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
already be done allowing this bill to
 
01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:06.500 align:start position:0%
pass does not mean that this is a new
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
option for people that want to adjust
 
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
numbers and and skew the facts
 
01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
and I'd just like to add that um you
 
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
know I don't have the education or the
 
01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
training that that you all have and I
 
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
certainly don't have the experience that
 
01:02:26.569 --> 01:02:26.579 align:start position:0%
Mr gortel has and just a resident here
 
01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
in Gilson we have 826 residents and as
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
it's budget time we have our annual
 
01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
reports spread out on the floor we flip
 
01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
through the ms-737s the 535s the 434s
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
and we have to flip back and forth if we
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
had a budget line item detail in
 
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet format we could sit at our
 
01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:52.740 align:start position:0%
system and look at it and then that
 
01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
would allow us to make a more educated
 
01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
vote when it comes to budget
 
01:03:01.849 --> 01:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
time right now we have difficulty
 
01:03:04.849 --> 01:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
finding out what our lines actually
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
contain because they're not expanded
 
01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
even during a public by the budget
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
committee meeting
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
so with that difficulty I ask that you
 
01:03:19.849 --> 01:03:19.859 align:start position:0%
please pass this bill I asked this last
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
year when it was presented as House Bill
 
01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:26.579 align:start position:0%
1460 and I again Ask it this year I
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
think it's a benefit to communities and
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to access this
 
01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
information thank you
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
and representative Billman you remember
 
01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
I was wondering
 
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
um and thank you Mr uh girl for taking
 
01:03:48.289 --> 01:03:48.299 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:03:50.569 --> 01:03:50.579 align:start position:0%
um all of the budget meetings have to
 
01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:54.020 align:start position:0%
occur as a public meeting where any
 
01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
products are published any follow-up and
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm going along the lines of the
 
01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
scanned PDF going up online and if
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
people follow a line uh I don't know
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
about all communities whether they
 
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
record their meetings or not
 
01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
but they uh as the meeting progresses
 
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
people can follow along with the line
 
01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
items if they even have it on their
 
01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:24.299 align:start position:0%
screen not printed out how does this not
 
01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:26.220 align:start position:0%
how does I don't know if I explained it
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
well enough but how does it not satisfy
 
01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
your concerns
 
01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:31.140 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for your
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
question I think there's really two
 
01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:34.140 align:start position:0%
questions here
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
um the first case and I mentioned this
 
01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
in a written testimony my first year on
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
the on the Hudson budget committee
 
01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
I I did this work I described I I took
 
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
electronic spreadsheet files I added
 
01:04:48.049 --> 01:04:48.059 align:start position:0%
some columns to identify the lines that
 
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
changed a lot I identified lines that
 
01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
were budgeted a lot different than past
 
01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
actual spending and this was used as a
 
01:04:57.049 --> 01:04:57.059 align:start position:0%
guide for the committee to to go through
 
01:04:59.390 --> 01:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
and we didn't change every line that
 
01:05:01.069 --> 01:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
that this is essentially to look at
 
01:05:03.289 --> 01:05:03.299 align:start position:0%
candidates and again we're looking at a
 
01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
thousand line spreadsheet and and the
 
01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
tool helps you identify things you
 
01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
should ask questions about this doesn't
 
01:05:14.569 --> 01:05:14.579 align:start position:0%
seem quite right why is that so we had
 
01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
several three four hour long budget
 
01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
committees meetings um our school board
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
rep was was texting our business
 
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
administrator and so I'm gonna say we
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
probably had 20 20 hours of analysis
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
doing these lines and so the first thing
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
the the spreadsheet is required to find
 
01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
the interesting lines so it's a tool for
 
01:05:35.809 --> 01:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
for doing that analysis and seeing which
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
ones need more attention uh secondly
 
01:05:41.329 --> 01:05:41.339 align:start position:0%
that year we modified 83 lines of the
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
budget so if you went through meeting
 
01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:46.140 align:start position:0%
minutes they were long long documents
 
01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
um someone motions to to amend this line
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
with this account number from this
 
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
amount to this amount it's second in
 
01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
there's discussion there's a roll call
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
vote and we move on and so imagine you
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
know five or or six uh meetings worth of
 
01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.490 align:start position:0%
know five or or six uh meetings worth of
this

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
um I need few lines you see simply
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't track it so grabbing um the
 
01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
latest version up website is is the way
 
01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
for the public to really understand what
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
the current budget looks like and in
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
this case the one example I discussed it
 
01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
looked very different when we were done
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
with it due to that a detailed analysis
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
uh representative Maggiore you had an
 
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
additional question
 
01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
yes I do have an additional question but
 
01:06:27.529 --> 01:06:27.539 align:start position:0%
it's going to go way back to to
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative piamonte and the the vote
 
01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
on the floor last year it would that be
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate now Mr chair or shall I wait
 
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
uh well since it was brought up I think
 
01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
if you wanna comment on that you you're
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
welcome to thank you it'll be very quick
 
01:06:48.049 --> 01:06:48.059 align:start position:0%
the the floor the division vote on the
 
01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
floor was 281-8 an overwhelming majority
 
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
and and that was good but the amendment
 
01:06:56.569 --> 01:06:56.579 align:start position:0%
that passed by that
 
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
so the vote on the floor was May do you
 
01:07:08.089 --> 01:07:08.099 align:start position:0%
but but this bill changes back to shall
 
01:07:12.049 --> 01:07:12.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:14.700 align:start position:0%
um I'll I'll defer to representative
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
piamonte on that one
 
01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm sorry I didn't ask uh
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
Mr representative piamonti directly I
 
01:07:21.359 --> 01:07:22.549 align:start position:0%
Mr representative piamonti directly I
apologize

01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately I can participate in
 
01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
the hearing I did introduce the bill
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh represent I mean uh Mr gortel can you
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh I I did testify thank you Mr chair I
 
01:07:41.089 --> 01:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
did testify for HP uh 1460 um I don't
 
01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
recall if it was mayor shell I I do feel
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
shell is is the right word here because
 
01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
uh without it it'll just be ignored and
 
01:07:50.089 --> 01:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
uh as I expressed them we wouldn't
 
01:07:50.099 --> 01:07:51.349 align:start position:0%
uh as I expressed them we wouldn't
testimony

01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
um there needs to be some guidance I I
 
01:07:55.390 --> 01:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
had a
 
01:07:58.010 --> 01:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
surprisingly difficult year doing the
 
01:07:59.930 --> 01:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
job I was required to do my state law
 
01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:02.700 align:start position:0%
without some of these documents and so I
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
think it's responsible uh to publish
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
them and I think uh ultimately you
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
develop trust with your community by
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
making this information public
 
01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:12.900 align:start position:0%
thank you the next person to testify is
 
01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
Christina Barrett who is in opposition
 
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
to uh HB 454
 
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman Dolan one quick
 
01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
correction um it's Barrett Christina
 
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
Barrett is the first name Christina is
 
01:08:28.269 --> 01:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
the last name
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
that uh chairman Owens it's a common
 
01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
mistake um by all means it happens all
 
01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:36.900 align:start position:0%
the time uh thank you committee members
 
01:08:39.289 --> 01:08:39.299 align:start position:0%
um my name is Barrett Christina I'm the
 
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
01:08:43.849 --> 01:08:43.859 align:start position:0%
school boards Association and chairman
 
01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
Dolan if I could just ask one quick uh
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
process question are we discussing all
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
three bills right now or are we just
 
01:08:53.809 --> 01:08:53.819 align:start position:0%
going to talk to to uh 243 right now I
 
01:08:56.329 --> 01:08:56.339 align:start position:0%
just I asked so I can uh provide my
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
comments accordingly yes and a rather
 
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
unusual uh technique today we are
 
01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:04.859 align:start position:0%
blending the the testimony on all three
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
bills normally we don't do that but
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
because there's no similar we we thought
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
it would be appropriate for the
 
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
committee to hear all three together
 
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely so thank you for that
 
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
clarification sir and I'll try to talk
 
01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
to all three bills if that's all right
 
01:09:19.249 --> 01:09:19.259 align:start position:0%
um again for the record uh my name is
 
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
Barrett Christine I'm the executive
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire school
 
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
boards Association we're sort of the
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
sister organization to the New Hampshire
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association we represented
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
about 160 school boards across the state
 
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
and provide multiple trainings on on
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
School District budgets and and related
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
matters to these three bills
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
um specifically to House Bill 2 243 I
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
think some of the concerns that nhsba
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
has with the bill have already
 
01:09:50.209 --> 01:09:50.219 align:start position:0%
um been been asked by some of the
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
committee members so we had questions
 
01:09:55.729 --> 01:09:55.739 align:start position:0%
about what a full line item detail means
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
and and certainly what industry
 
01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
um uh standard electronic spreadsheets
 
01:10:03.130 --> 01:10:03.140 align:start position:0%
um mean
 
01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
our bigger concern with this bill is
 
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
you're asking you know close to 400
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
public bodies to to alter and amend and
 
01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:15.179 align:start position:0%
perhaps purchase new software in order
 
01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
to comply with 243.
 
01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I think it may be more prudent
 
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
and more efficient not just for this
 
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
committee but for 160 school boards
 
01:10:30.010 --> 01:10:30.020 align:start position:0%
across the state and I believe there are
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
240 or so uh talented municipalities
 
01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire
 
01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
um if if the desire of this committee is
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
to pass a bill that provides um greater
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
access and transparency to to taxpayers
 
01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
and voters to be able to review uh their
 
01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
local budgets I think that the dra might
 
01:10:52.679 --> 01:10:53.510 align:start position:0%
local budgets I think that the dra might
be

01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
um it might be more prudent for the dra
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
to perhaps create some sort of standard
 
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
forms for towns and school districts to
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
use for their budget preparation we know
 
01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
that the dra certainly has forms for
 
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
sort of post-budget aspects if you will
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
the pertinence school district forms are
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
the ms-26 the ms-27 for school districts
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
that have uh Municipal budget committees
 
01:11:22.729 --> 01:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
and then there's a default budget form
 
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
as well too and and in looking through
 
01:11:27.770 --> 01:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
these they list all the line items that
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue Administration
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
um indicates in their in their
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
department and their department rules
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
the 1100 lines the 1200 lines the 1300
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
lines expenditures for the prior year
 
01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
expenditures current year is approved by
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
the dra Appropriations for the ensuing
 
01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal year Appropriations for the
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
recommended Appropriations for the
 
01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
ensuing fiscal year uh record not
 
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
Appropriations not recommended for the
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
ensuing fiscal year so I understand that
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
these forms are filled out after your
 
01:11:59.870 --> 01:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
annual meeting
 
01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
um so it really doesn't necessarily help
 
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
on sort of the front end if members of
 
01:12:05.330 --> 01:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
the public or budget committees want to
 
01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
see where the public body is either
 
01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
increasing or decreasing a line item
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
um but but the available the information
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
is certainly available through existing
 
01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
Department Department of Revenue
 
01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
um forms and it seems that that may be a
 
01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
more prudent course of action rather
 
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
than uh rather than having you know 400
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
local political bodies have to to change
 
01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
what they're doing have to purchase
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
software and things of that nature so
 
01:12:39.169 --> 01:12:39.179 align:start position:0%
that's our primary concern with um with
 
01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
House Bill 243
 
01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
if I could speak to House Bill 5 uh I'm
 
01:12:48.290 --> 01:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
sorry 454 right now
 
01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
um and I understand there there's an
 
01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
amendment coming but I'm just looking at
 
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
the bill now this is on line eight
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
um that the the public body
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
um shell provide to the budget committee
 
01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
at such times and in such detail as the
 
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
budget committee shall fix
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
I I can speak to this pretty clearly
 
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
every year usually in the fall when when
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
school districts and school boards and
 
01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
budget committees are working on their
 
01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
budgets the New Hampshire school boards
 
01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
Association receives numerous phone
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
calls every year from either a school
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
board chairperson or a superintendent or
 
01:13:24.649 --> 01:13:24.659 align:start position:0%
perhaps a school district business
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
administrator saying
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know so and so from the budget
 
01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
committee emailed me or called me and he
 
01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
said he wants these documents and these
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
formats and he wants he needs them by 5
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
pm today because they're having a
 
01:13:38.689 --> 01:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
meeting tonight
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
um and that creates uh confusion for the
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
school district
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't help the budget committee
 
01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
as well too but you know we and so the
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
business administrator may try to comply
 
01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
with that request but the next day he
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
gets another request from another budget
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
Committee Member for something else
 
01:13:59.090 --> 01:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
that's either done differently or in a
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
different format or need to buy a
 
01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
different time
 
01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
so when when we have these concerns with
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
um sort of relations between budget
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
committees and school boards nhsba
 
01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
advises the school board to have a
 
01:14:15.229 --> 01:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
conversation with the budget committee
 
01:14:16.729 --> 01:14:16.739 align:start position:0%
and see if they can establish some sort
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
of ground rules where there will will
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
there be a point of contact from the
 
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
budget committee to the school board or
 
01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
to the school district to request these
 
01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
sorts of these sorts of documents and
 
01:14:29.630 --> 01:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
this sort of information
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
um but if we're going to be putting it
 
01:14:33.709 --> 01:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
in law that in in such details the
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
budget committee shall fix now from a
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
sort of a governance standpoint I I
 
01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:40.140 align:start position:0%
would read that as presuming that the
 
01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
budget committee would have to take a
 
01:14:43.490 --> 01:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
vote to determine what information they
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
wanted in the format that they wanted in
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
the manner that they wanted it and then
 
01:14:49.130 --> 01:14:49.140 align:start position:0%
a liaison or representative from their
 
01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
budget committee would have to uh
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
contact the school district to make that
 
01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:54.900 align:start position:0%
request in reality that's not how it
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
always happens though
 
01:14:58.250 --> 01:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
um you know as elected officials budget
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
committee members often will call as I
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned we'll call the superintendent
 
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
or or were called a business
 
01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
administrator and sometimes they request
 
01:15:07.729 --> 01:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
information in certain formats sometimes
 
01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
they demand certain information in in
 
01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
certain formats so
 
01:15:13.729 --> 01:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
um this is more I think a communication
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
issue that doesn't necessarily need to
 
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
be put into State Statute
 
01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
um you know I think if if the budget
 
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
committee whether it's not the
 
01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
chairperson or the liaison or the direct
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
um point of contact for the school board
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
if they can have these conversations you
 
01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
know at the get-go you know before Labor
 
01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
Day or right after Labor Day when
 
01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
everybody's starting to dig into a work
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
that can alleviate a lot of the
 
01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
challenges or frustrations that I think
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
budget committees may have and perhaps
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
the school boards may have as well too
 
01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
so From nhsba's perspective um I think
 
01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
that's again that's a sort of a local
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
communication issue that should be
 
01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
ironed out between between the two
 
01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
public bodies to find the best and most
 
01:15:54.890 --> 01:15:54.900 align:start position:0%
efficient method in which the school
 
01:15:56.689 --> 01:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
board or the school district can provide
 
01:15:58.430 --> 01:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
the budget committee the information
 
01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
that they necessarily need
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
um and last uh speaking to uh House Bill
 
01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.490 align:start position:0%
um and last uh speaking to uh House Bill
415

01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
415
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
um as it reads as the bills uh currently
 
01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
reads um that the it says but the the
 
01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
governing body
 
01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
um shall uh uh excuse me uh shall
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
prepare statements and estimated
 
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
expenditures of revenues for the ensuing
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and shall submit such
 
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
statements to the respective governing
 
01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
bodies so on and so forth but no fewer
 
01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
than 30 days prior to the public budget
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
hearing for the budget
 
01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
um that is concerning um simply because
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to limit the amount of time
 
01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
in which school boards have to get their
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
budget done now most budget hearings are
 
01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
usually held under RSA 32 are usually
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
held in the middle the middle of uh uh
 
01:16:52.729 --> 01:16:52.739 align:start position:0%
December for talented school districts
 
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
um by requiring that that information be
 
01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
done 30 days prior is going to
 
01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
significantly limit I think
 
01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
um I think the the the
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
I think it's going to going to inhibit
 
01:17:07.729 --> 01:17:07.739 align:start position:0%
or limit the
 
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
the best matter in which that budget can
 
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:11.940 align:start position:0%
be prepared
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
um you know school boards are often
 
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
working through this right up until the
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
day that the budget needs to be
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
published prior to the prior to the the
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
budget hearing and by moving that back
 
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
30 days you're disallowing
 
01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
um you know our municipalities and our
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
select boards just that extra 30 days
 
01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
um to to really get down and present a
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
prudent um and a clear budget uh to the
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
voters the other aspect to that is often
 
01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
Collective I know collective bargaining
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
Agreements are done on a via separate
 
01:17:43.729 --> 01:17:43.739 align:start position:0%
warrant article or not necessarily
 
01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
included within your your general
 
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
um but if the if if members of the
 
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
public want the full picture of what the
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
the overall budget will be for a school
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
district collective bargaining is not
 
01:17:59.209 --> 01:17:59.219 align:start position:0%
often done or completed by the middle of
 
01:17:59.219 --> 01:18:00.290 align:start position:0%
often done or completed by the middle of
December

01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
December
 
01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:03.060 align:start position:0%
um you know there are some it can it's I
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
mean ideally it's done by by the new
 
01:18:05.159 --> 01:18:06.169 align:start position:0%
mean ideally it's done by by the new
year

01:18:06.169 --> 01:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
um but you know there may be times where
 
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
school boards and and teachers unions
 
01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
need that extra week or two to hammer
 
01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
out the final provisions of eclectic
 
01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement and some of the
 
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
cost items that are going to be
 
01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
presented to the public so we have
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
concerns that by pushing that back or
 
01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
pushing that up 30 days
 
01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
um you're going to get you're not going
 
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
to get um as good a budget as you might
 
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
possibly have if school boards and other
 
01:18:32.209 --> 01:18:32.219 align:start position:0%
towns have additional time to to fight
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
to finalize their budgets before posting
 
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
for the budget hearing
 
01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
um the other aspect relative to House
 
01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:39.490 align:start position:0%
um the other aspect relative to House
Bill

01:18:39.490 --> 01:18:39.500 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:18:42.649 --> 01:18:42.659 align:start position:0%
415 where it says the governing body
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
shall publish the draft budget and
 
01:18:48.530 --> 01:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
revised versions one I'm not sure what
 
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
the draft budget means does that mean
 
01:18:53.810 --> 01:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
the the initially proposed budget that
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
is being presented at the um at the
 
01:18:57.709 --> 01:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
budget hearing
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
um and and and version revised versions
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
um this is sort of one of those areas
 
01:19:06.169 --> 01:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
where there's a difference between
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
statute and practice
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
um you know there may be there may be
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
dozens of revised budgets
 
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
um you know business administrators and
 
01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
superintendents are working on on
 
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
budgets all year long
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
um as soon as uh March 20 21 annual
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
meetings are done if hopefully hopefully
 
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
we can get through them I say March some
 
01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
of those we know maybe maybe in April or
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
May this year
 
01:19:34.209 --> 01:19:34.219 align:start position:0%
um but by the end of the school year
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
we're already working on budgets for the
 
01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
following year we're looking at
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
projected revenues we're looking at
 
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
student enrollments and I know over
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
um usually over the summer is when
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
superintendents and business
 
01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
administrators will sit down with their
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
other administrative staff they're
 
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
building level staff their special
 
01:19:52.610 --> 01:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
education directors school principals
 
01:19:54.649 --> 01:19:54.659 align:start position:0%
and over the Summers when they start
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
developing the next year's budget so to
 
01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.350 align:start position:0%
developing the next year's budget so to
require

01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
um that um a draft budgets and revised
 
01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:05.689 align:start position:0%
um that um a draft budgets and revised
versions

01:20:05.689 --> 01:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
versions
 
01:20:05.699 --> 01:20:06.370 align:start position:0%
versions
um

01:20:06.370 --> 01:20:06.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
after making any updates to the budget
 
01:20:10.729 --> 01:20:10.739 align:start position:0%
have to be posted or noticed within five
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
days it that belies the reality I mean
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
you may have two or three draft budgets
 
01:20:17.689 --> 01:20:17.699 align:start position:0%
in a single day the business
 
01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
administrator and the superintendent
 
01:20:21.649 --> 01:20:21.659 align:start position:0%
May sit down at eight o'clock in the
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
morning work on the budget for a couple
 
01:20:24.590 --> 01:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
hours and then go off and do other work
 
01:20:26.450 --> 01:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
and they may come back at four o'clock
 
01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon and do another couple
 
01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
hours on the budget so I'm not sure what
 
01:20:33.169 --> 01:20:33.179 align:start position:0%
a draft budget or what a final or a an
 
01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:34.860 align:start position:0%
amended budget
 
01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
um or a revised version excuse me a
 
01:20:39.169 --> 01:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
draft budget or a revised version would
 
01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean so without any further
 
01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:43.980 align:start position:0%
clarifying language in that
 
01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
um it it just doesn't make sense from
 
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
sort of a practical standpoint in the
 
01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
way that that school district budgets
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
are are actually developed
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
um so those are nhsba's comments um on
 
01:20:57.530 --> 01:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
the on the three bills um you know we
 
01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
certainly are happy to promote anything
 
01:21:02.689 --> 01:21:02.699 align:start position:0%
that can increase transparency and
 
01:21:02.699 --> 01:21:04.010 align:start position:0%
that can increase transparency and
increase

01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
um uh uh voters being more prepared or
 
01:21:09.530 --> 01:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
more or more aware of of their budgets
 
01:21:10.910 --> 01:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
before they actually have to vote on
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
them but we think that the language in
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
these three bills is is vague as
 
01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
confusing May impose significant
 
01:21:20.570 --> 01:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
um additional uh requirements on public
 
01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:22.010 align:start position:0%
um additional uh requirements on public
bodies

01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
um and and just does not fit for the way
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
that these actually work and we think
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
that some of these things certainly have
 
01:21:28.669 --> 01:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
Merit but we think that maybe the
 
01:21:31.010 --> 01:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
um might be um the better place to
 
01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
direct some of these some of these
 
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
proposals and with that I'm happy to
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
answer any questions Mr Christine I have
 
01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
a couple of questions from the committee
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:47.209 --> 01:21:47.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr C uh chair thank you Mr
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
Christina for taking my question so
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you for a very detailed uh
 
01:21:56.510 --> 01:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
testimony in terms of
 
01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:57.110 align:start position:0%
testimony in terms of
um

01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:59.630 --> 01:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
how these three builds are going to
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
impact uh my question is by just simply
 
01:22:09.250 --> 01:22:09.260 align:start position:0%
putting it is this helping
 
01:22:13.090 --> 01:22:13.100 align:start position:0%
or at the local budget school boards
 
01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
counties in cities make a really
 
01:22:21.649 --> 01:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
transparent budget process or it's going
 
01:22:25.490 --> 01:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
to hinder with not enough tools is it an
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
enabling or
 
01:22:31.610 --> 01:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
uh more controlling yeah sure thank you
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
for the question representative
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
um you know we think that there are ways
 
01:22:39.290 --> 01:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
to certainly enhance
 
01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
um The public's awareness of these of
 
01:22:43.610 --> 01:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
these matters we just think nhsba just
 
01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
thinks that that the three bills at
 
01:22:46.729 --> 01:22:46.739 align:start position:0%
least as presented I understand there
 
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
may be an amendment coming I don't under
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that amendment is going
 
01:22:51.649 --> 01:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
to be just these things in a single bill
 
01:22:53.090 --> 01:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
or if they're going to be language
 
01:22:56.689 --> 01:22:56.699 align:start position:0%
changes as well too but we think that
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
that these three bills are going to
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
um sort of hinder the necessary work
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's being done within the central
 
01:23:05.149 --> 01:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
office between the school board and the
 
01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
superintendent and the administrator
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
um and we would certainly hope that this
 
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
would increase transparency if these
 
01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
bills were to go through but
 
01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
um I'm not certain that's going to be
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
the case for the reasons that I that I
 
01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:18.770 align:start position:0%
the case for the reasons that I that I
stated

01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
stated
 
01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Trill Evan
 
01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I have a question
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
for you and I don't mean to throw a
 
01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
wrench into the works but I was candidly
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
surprised when you asked Mr Mr Christina
 
01:23:34.130 --> 01:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
asked if we were hearing all three bills
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
at once and my understanding was that
 
01:23:38.209 --> 01:23:38.219 align:start position:0%
yes during the exact session we were
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
going to consider them all together but
 
01:23:41.570 --> 01:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
we weren't going to hear them
 
01:23:44.689 --> 01:23:44.699 align:start position:0%
all at once from each speaker so can you
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
clarify this for me yeah that sure the
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh the way it was we have it posted in
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
the calendar we all three of them are
 
01:23:55.250 --> 01:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
simultaneously being heard uh so that's
 
01:23:57.229 --> 01:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
the way we posted it and and the reason
 
01:23:58.490 --> 01:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
we did that there were a couple of
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
techniques we could have sent this to a
 
01:24:02.630 --> 01:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to have the subcommittee
 
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
work things out uh but it was it's in my
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
judgment that we're uh we're up against
 
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
the calendar and uh we wouldn't have
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
time for that to happen unless we
 
01:24:17.149 --> 01:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
retained uh the balance of these bills
 
01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the clarification I see
 
01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
it now and I understand thank you Mr
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
chair okay and representatively
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh Mr chair
 
01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
um Mr uh Christina
 
01:24:33.290 --> 01:24:33.300 align:start position:0%
um now that we have brought up all three
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
of these bills
 
01:24:37.610 --> 01:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
um I I have a question to ask you
 
01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:38.350 align:start position:0%
um I I have a question to ask you
um

01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
especially this year with um the covid
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
um pandemic and money's coming in from
 
01:24:48.530 --> 01:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
um different locations and unexpected
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
um expenses and so on I know places like
 
01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.490 align:start position:0%
um expenses and so on I know places like
Nashua

01:24:52.490 --> 01:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
Nashua
 
01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
have kind of delayed their public
 
01:24:57.770 --> 01:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
hearing so that they can honestly work
 
01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
right up to the the last minute of the
 
01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
public hearing I'm sure it wouldn't be
 
01:25:04.970 --> 01:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
that day they put pen to paper I'm sure
 
01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
that there would be some heads up so
 
01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
that the public would have it ahead of
 
01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
time you did mention the 30 days do you
 
01:25:12.169 --> 01:25:12.179 align:start position:0%
feel that
 
01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
um this would create a um a less than um
 
01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say perfect but less
 
01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
than good even
 
01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
um draft or proposed budget
 
01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
for for the municipalities yeah thank
 
01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative it
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
just seems that if a school board had or
 
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
or a select board has an extra 30 days
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
to work through their budget that they
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
have an extra 30 days to provide more
 
01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
scrutiny um and and more attention to
 
01:25:43.250 --> 01:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
the overall budget so again I think you
 
01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
believe you're speaking to um
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
is it 4 15 I believe uh representative
 
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
so yeah yeah I mean if a school board
 
01:25:54.290 --> 01:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
has an extra 30 days to to to to to to
 
01:25:56.209 --> 01:25:56.219 align:start position:0%
to work through that budget and to make
 
01:25:58.129 --> 01:25:58.139 align:start position:0%
the necessary changes we think that's
 
01:25:59.689 --> 01:25:59.699 align:start position:0%
going to result in a better product at
 
01:26:02.330 --> 01:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
the end representative Mr chair may I
 
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
ask a follow-up oh yes you can go ahead
 
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
um I I guess then my my next question
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
would be um because we do want
 
01:26:11.810 --> 01:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
transparency and we do want to give the
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
public some time to do as um some of the
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
other speakers had mentioned
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
um in in your opinion what would be um a
 
01:26:22.729 --> 01:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
fair time frame would you look at a week
 
01:26:24.110 --> 01:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
five days
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
um because they don't believe that I
 
01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
mean I know up to the last minute school
 
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
boards can be doing it but um what do
 
01:26:31.129 --> 01:26:31.139 align:start position:0%
you think would be fair and uh
 
01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
representative of of both parties yeah
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that that's a
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
wonderful question representative
 
01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
um you know we there's a balance too
 
01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
between Just Between the calendar the
 
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
reality is you know the budget hearings
 
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
are are the middle of uh the municipal
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
budget hearings under RSA 32 or I'm just
 
01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
going to say the middle of middle of
 
01:26:53.629 --> 01:26:53.639 align:start position:0%
January January
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
um you know and and that week between
 
01:26:59.090 --> 01:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
obviously Christmas and New Year's is is
 
01:27:00.770 --> 01:27:00.780 align:start position:0%
challenging as well too for public
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
bodies so I mean I the seven days notice
 
01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
perhaps I just I mean and I'm I'm sort
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
of spitballing there I'm not making a
 
01:27:11.930 --> 01:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
specific recommendation but I mean I
 
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
think a week's notice to present a a
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
budget before the budget hearing would
 
01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
give the give the you know the public
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable time to to to to to to to
 
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
give provided such scrutiny as they as
 
01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:28.280 align:start position:0%
they as they desire
 
01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
one additional question from
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative Porter before we go on to
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
additional folks to testify yes
 
01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
Representatives thanks Mr chair uh thank
 
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you thank you Miss
 
01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:37.970 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you thank you Miss
Dina

01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
Dina
 
01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:38.930 align:start position:0%
Dina
um

01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
familiar with the budget committee
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
because my communities do not have one
 
01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:45.719 align:start position:0%
but our school district is an sb2
 
01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
school um school district and I know our
 
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
deliberative session this year happened
 
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
early in February if this 30 days were
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
to occur
 
01:27:58.610 --> 01:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
in in a town or a school district that's
 
01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:00.290 align:start position:0%
in in a town or a school district that's
sb2

01:28:00.290 --> 01:28:00.300 align:start position:0%
sb2
 
01:28:02.689 --> 01:28:02.699 align:start position:0%
um how early would they have to have
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
their budget completed
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
in order
 
01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
to meet that deadline for the
 
01:28:10.189 --> 01:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
deliberative session sure thank you very
 
01:28:11.629 --> 01:28:11.639 align:start position:0%
much for the question representative
 
01:28:14.209 --> 01:28:14.219 align:start position:0%
even if you were an sb2 telling your
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
deliberative session for schools is
 
01:28:17.689 --> 01:28:17.699 align:start position:0%
usually the first Saturday in February
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
my understanding I believe all the other
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
I'd have to go back and give RSA 40
 
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
another look in RSA 32 I believe the
 
01:28:27.770 --> 01:28:27.780 align:start position:0%
timelines for posting your budget
 
01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
hearings and and posting the initial
 
01:28:33.229 --> 01:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
proposed budget are the same
 
01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
um for sb2 as they are for for
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
traditional Town meetings I know the
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
01:28:43.129 --> 01:28:43.139 align:start position:0%
publishes a timeline every year for for
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
dates of when things need to be proposed
 
01:28:46.970 --> 01:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
and when petitioned warrant articles
 
01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
need to be need to be acted on and
 
01:28:51.169 --> 01:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
things of that nature when they need to
 
01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
be submitted you know for for
 
01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:54.110 align:start position:0%
be submitted you know for for
consideration

01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:28:57.169 --> 01:28:57.179 align:start position:0%
um but I believe the the budget hearings
 
01:28:59.570 --> 01:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
um that are are listed in I believe
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 415. I believe that's the
 
01:29:06.169 --> 01:29:06.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%

the chair to representative power in the
 
01:29:40.739 --> 01:29:41.750 align:start position:0%
the chair to representative power in the
LOB

01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
LOB
 
01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.729 align:start position:0%
LOB
yes

01:29:43.729 --> 01:29:43.739 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
um I had my hand raised um
 
01:29:48.770 --> 01:29:48.780 align:start position:0%
for the past two speakers and I have two
 
01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
brief questions if you will right ahead
 
01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
I apologize for not not seeing you
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
so um for Ms Ayer well thank you for
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
allowing me to and ask these questions
 
01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
so for Ms Fair
 
01:30:02.699 --> 01:30:04.010 align:start position:0%
so for Ms Fair
um

01:30:04.010 --> 01:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
I missed the point as I was taking notes
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
she had described that um in her
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
experience there was a body that was
 
01:30:14.810 --> 01:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
putting actual printouts of budgets on
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
um she um clarify which what body that
 
01:30:20.639 --> 01:30:22.910 align:start position:0%
um she um clarify which what body that
was

01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:25.850 --> 01:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
sure thank you so
 
01:30:29.330 --> 01:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
we have a small town and when budget
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
season comes up we ask for the full
 
01:30:33.950 --> 01:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
budget detail
 
01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
we are typically not given it it's not
 
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
bombed out so we see each of the line
 
01:30:43.010 --> 01:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
items so we rely on
 
01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
the printed budget detail that we're
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to see
 
01:30:50.110 --> 01:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
the annual reports with previous years
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
so we can then make comparisons and it
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
is very difficult to decide what we
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
should be voting on and what we should
 
01:31:02.930 --> 01:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
be cutting back because
 
01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:03.950 align:start position:0%
be cutting back because
um

01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
if for instance salt we were paying
 
01:31:09.229 --> 01:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars a year we have
 
01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
15 miles of Road and because of that
 
01:31:16.129 --> 01:31:16.139 align:start position:0%
when we can't calculate the years out in
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
advance and see the trends we didn't
 
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
realize that we only need a budget half
 
01:31:24.530 --> 01:31:24.540 align:start position:0%
that for our salt so for the past five
 
01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
or so years we've been budgeting double
 
01:31:31.129 --> 01:31:31.139 align:start position:0%
the amount necessary that money in a
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
small community is very important and
 
01:31:34.850 --> 01:31:34.860 align:start position:0%
that could have gone towards something
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
else and that's just one example of not
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
being able to see and that's why we
 
01:31:44.090 --> 01:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
um many residents here in town support
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
this we actually took initiative last
 
01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
year after I testified in February on on
 
01:31:54.770 --> 01:31:54.780 align:start position:0%
1460 we put in a Citizens petition to
 
01:31:57.169 --> 01:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
have the Border Selectmen include the
 
01:31:59.149 --> 01:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
full budget detail in the annual report
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
at least thinking it was a step towards
 
01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:04.250 align:start position:0%
at least thinking it was a step towards
transparency

01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
um that passed overwhelmingly at Town
 
01:32:07.490 --> 01:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
vote unfortunately the board of
 
01:32:10.129 --> 01:32:10.139 align:start position:0%
selectman felt that that was not a vote
 
01:32:12.649 --> 01:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
that needed to be honored so we still
 
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
are in the same boat and we're again
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
looking towards this bill and and hope
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
that it passes we do have QuickBooks we
 
01:32:24.169 --> 01:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
have spreadsheets in town this is not
 
01:32:26.689 --> 01:32:26.699 align:start position:0%
going to increase our expenditure from
 
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
what I can tell I don't know about large
 
01:32:32.330 --> 01:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
towns or cities but as far as our town
 
01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
our full budget detail would only be six
 
01:32:36.290 --> 01:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
pages Max
 
01:32:39.290 --> 01:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
so it for the most of the towns in New
 
01:32:40.970 --> 01:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are small
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
I feel that this this is probably more
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
economical because now they're not
 
01:32:48.050 --> 01:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
printing out these papers or finding the
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
time to visit your town hall that's only
 
01:32:53.689 --> 01:32:53.699 align:start position:0%
open six hours a week it's very limiting
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:00.189 --> 01:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
representative power you had a follow-up
 
01:33:02.990 --> 01:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
the second question I have is for
 
01:33:04.850 --> 01:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
attorney Christina
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm seeking clarification on a point
 
01:33:10.030 --> 01:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
um if governing bodies are already
 
01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:12.300 align:start position:0%
perhaps generating budgets
 
01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:14.330 align:start position:0%
perhaps generating budgets
electronically

01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
01:33:17.090 --> 01:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm seeking clarification as to what
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
specific software that
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
um you're referring to when you had
 
01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
indicated in your testimony that um
 
01:33:29.689 --> 01:33:29.699 align:start position:0%
upwards of you know 400 bodies in our
 
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
state being
 
01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
um be required to purchase additional
 
01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
software I'm trying to understand
 
01:33:39.169 --> 01:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
um what that software may be thank you
 
01:33:40.250 --> 01:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:33:42.290 --> 01:33:42.300 align:start position:0%
representative the the language that's
 
01:33:44.209 --> 01:33:44.219 align:start position:0%
used in at least one of the bills is
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
industry standard software I readily
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
admit I don't know what the common
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
software is it's being used in school
 
01:33:51.770 --> 01:33:51.780 align:start position:0%
districts I don't know if it's just
 
01:33:53.090 --> 01:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
Excel I don't know if there's another
 
01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
sort of accounting software that maybe
 
01:33:58.129 --> 01:33:58.139 align:start position:0%
use I I simply don't know
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
um but we certainly did hear testimony
 
01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
from one of the other Representatives I
 
01:34:03.890 --> 01:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
forget specifically who but said that
 
01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
she uses a different software for her
 
01:34:09.169 --> 01:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
her private business or her private
 
01:34:11.930 --> 01:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
company and that's industry standard for
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
for her or for at least for her for her
 
01:34:14.639 --> 01:34:15.470 align:start position:0%
for her or for at least for her for her
company

01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
company
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
um at least standard for her company so
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
I mean I I I I I presume that Excel is
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
used extensively um across the state but
 
01:34:26.930 --> 01:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to that specifically
 
01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh next speaker we have
 
01:34:36.410 --> 01:34:36.420 align:start position:0%

three and a half minutes but I would
 
01:34:55.570 --> 01:34:55.580 align:start position:0%
also like to respond to attorney

um honorable chairman and committee
 
01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
members I'm Donna green president of the
 
01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
school district governance Association
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire we are a non-profit
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
privately funded organization
 
01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
our members are mostly current or former
 
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
elected School District officials
 
01:35:22.610 --> 01:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
many in our membership have experienced
 
01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
ongoing problems obtaining timely and
 
01:35:28.729 --> 01:35:28.739 align:start position:0%
useful budget information from their
 
01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:31.860 align:start position:0%
school administrative units it is
 
01:35:33.890 --> 01:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
completely unreasonable that elected
 
01:35:35.689 --> 01:35:35.699 align:start position:0%
officials have to fight to receive
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
budgets in live spreadsheet form but
 
01:35:40.970 --> 01:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
fight they must in many cases
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
we thank representative pamonti for
 
01:35:45.649 --> 01:35:45.659 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this legislation
 
01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
while I was a member of the Timberlane
 
01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
Regional School Board I myself had to go
 
01:35:52.610 --> 01:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire Supreme Court to
 
01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
obtain my school district's budget in
 
01:35:58.430 --> 01:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
full line item detail in spreadsheet
 
01:35:58.440 --> 01:35:59.450 align:start position:0%
full line item detail in spreadsheet
form

01:35:59.450 --> 01:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
form
 
01:36:03.709 --> 01:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
my SAU spent fifty thousand dollars in
 
01:36:06.649 --> 01:36:06.659 align:start position:0%
legal fees to prevent me
 
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
or anyone else from having a useful
 
01:36:13.629 --> 01:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
version of the 68 million dollar budget
 
01:36:16.669 --> 01:36:16.679 align:start position:0%
thankfully I prevailed in the end
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
it sounds incredible doesn't it that an
 
01:36:21.649 --> 01:36:21.659 align:start position:0%
SAU would see fit to spend its taxpayers
 
01:36:24.290 --> 01:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
money this way but this is an indication
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
of how reluctant some public bodies are
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
to allow their elected overseers robust
 
01:36:33.010 --> 01:36:33.020 align:start position:0%
financial information
 
01:36:35.570 --> 01:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
while few elected officials have
 
01:36:37.729 --> 01:36:37.739 align:start position:0%
resorted to the courts typically they
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
must be satisfied with much less
 
01:36:42.169 --> 01:36:42.179 align:start position:0%
information than they would desire I
 
01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
know of one situation two years ago
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
where a school budget committee chairman
 
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
asked the SAU business administrator for
 
01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
the budget in spreadsheet form the next
 
01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
meeting no spreadsheet so the board
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
voted as a whole to request a
 
01:36:59.570 --> 01:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet the next meeting no
 
01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:00.830 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet the next meeting no
spreadsheet

01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
01:37:03.169 --> 01:37:03.179 align:start position:0%
so the board voted to demand a
 
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet four weeks went by before
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
they were given a spreadsheet and by
 
01:37:10.189 --> 01:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
then the committee had just a few
 
01:37:12.649 --> 01:37:12.659 align:start position:0%
meetings left so this deliberate delay
 
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
by the administration worked against the
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
elected officials prudent and proper
 
01:37:20.209 --> 01:37:20.219 align:start position:0%
oversight of the budget and the public
 
01:37:20.219 --> 01:37:24.169 align:start position:0%
oversight of the budget and the public
interest

01:37:24.169 --> 01:37:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:26.209 --> 01:37:26.219 align:start position:0%
although we would like to think that
 
01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
saus exist to ex to assist the elected
 
01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
officials the reality is that
 
01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
superintendents and saus have their own
 
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
powerful institutional interests that
 
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
are very often
 
01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
in direct conflict with the interests of
 
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
the people the elected officials
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
represent the history of modern
 
01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
education has been an astronomical
 
01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
increase in administration and cost for
 
01:37:55.729 --> 01:37:55.739 align:start position:0%
a very depressing decrease in
 
01:37:55.739 --> 01:37:57.189 align:start position:0%
a very depressing decrease in
competencies

01:37:57.189 --> 01:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
competencies
 
01:38:00.490 --> 01:38:00.500 align:start position:0%
administrators always want more money
 
01:38:04.010 --> 01:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
taxpayers want value for money these
 
01:38:05.810 --> 01:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
changes to the law are needed to help
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
budget committees and school boards do
 
01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
the job the public expects them to do
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
there are very few penalties for public
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
bodies who fail to follow Municipal
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
budget law at the very least elected
 
01:38:21.770 --> 01:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
officials need the transparency tools to
 
01:38:23.629 --> 01:38:23.639 align:start position:0%
properly supervise
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
and oversee the sizable tax dollars
 
01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
entrusted to public bodies
 
01:38:33.410 --> 01:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
sadly many sau's need to be compelled to
 
01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
provide these tools and in a timely
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
fashion anyway anyone who testifies
 
01:38:41.330 --> 01:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
differently is doing so in the interests
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
of sau's and paid administrators no
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
matter the name of their organization
 
01:38:50.330 --> 01:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
I have submitted written testimony of a
 
01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
somewhat difficult a different nature
 
01:38:56.270 --> 01:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
um and to uh address attorney
 
01:38:59.930 --> 01:38:59.940 align:start position:0%
Christina's objections the dra forms are
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
nowhere near the detail of what is
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
required or what is being asked for in
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
these bills no they are extremely high
 
01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
level uh forms and I
 
01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
I do not believe the dra would have any
 
01:39:18.410 --> 01:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
interest in the voluminous my districts
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:39:24.110 --> 01:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
my District's budget when it was printed
 
01:39:27.770 --> 01:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
out was um just about six inches thick
 
01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
I do not think the dra would like to see
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
that level of detail
 
01:39:34.370 --> 01:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
although the budget committee certainly
 
01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:35.270 align:start position:0%
although the budget committee certainly
would

01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:39:38.209 --> 01:39:38.219 align:start position:0%
no new software is required because
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
everyone is using electronic budgeting
 
01:39:43.810 --> 01:39:43.820 align:start position:0%
software and all of that software
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
exports to spreadsheets
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
um as to
 
01:39:52.010 --> 01:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
business administrators having to
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
respond to different formats and
 
01:39:55.370 --> 01:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
different requests
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
that is a very simple uh issue of the
 
01:40:01.129 --> 01:40:01.139 align:start position:0%
board as a whole taking a vote to decide
 
01:40:04.370 --> 01:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
what kind of level of detail and in what
 
01:40:06.770 --> 01:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
format they request and as you can see
 
01:40:08.450 --> 01:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
it's a constant fight with the
 
01:40:11.330 --> 01:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
administrators failing to provide it and
 
01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
trying to run out the clock
 
01:40:17.450 --> 01:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
as for 30 days notice I would just say
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
that Republic bodies are going to have
 
01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
to schedule their deliberations so that
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
the public has and a better opportunity
 
01:40:28.610 --> 01:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
to scrutinize the budget if you think 30
 
01:40:30.649 --> 01:40:30.659 align:start position:0%
days is too long then perhaps it should
 
01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
only be two weeks but there has to be
 
01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
some uh some set
 
01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:37.450 align:start position:0%
some uh some set
um

01:40:37.450 --> 01:40:37.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity for uh for better
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
transparency and the fact that
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining might be going on
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
is completely independent of the
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
budgeting and um the budget you know
 
01:40:54.890 --> 01:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
um the collective bargaining agreement
 
01:40:57.169 --> 01:40:57.179 align:start position:0%
is voted on separately from the budget
 
01:40:57.179 --> 01:40:58.490 align:start position:0%
is voted on separately from the budget
so

01:40:58.490 --> 01:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
um although I do believe that those two
 
01:41:02.330 --> 01:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:41:04.729 --> 01:41:04.739 align:start position:0%
um occurring simultaneously
 
01:41:07.970 --> 01:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
and point of fact they don't
 
01:41:09.410 --> 01:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:10.490 align:start position:0%
um so
um

01:41:10.490 --> 01:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:12.110 --> 01:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
you know I
 
01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your time today and I do
 
01:41:17.090 --> 01:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
hope you'll support these bills and I
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
would be very happy to entertain some
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you so much
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
I don't see any questions uh right now
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna go on to our next speaker
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh Cordell Johnson from ahma who like to
 
01:41:31.970 --> 01:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition of all three bills
 
01:41:36.169 --> 01:41:36.179 align:start position:0%
and I and may I say that uh that I would
 
01:41:40.370 --> 01:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
ask those who are speaking to uh to try
 
01:41:43.370 --> 01:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
to be succinct as we are overdue in our
 
01:41:45.530 --> 01:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
time slot for uh for this bill by about
 
01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
15 minutes already so uh sorry sorry
 
01:41:50.450 --> 01:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
that you're at the end of the of the
 
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
list Mr Johnson but uh that's where we
 
01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:53.930 align:start position:0%
list Mr Johnson but uh that's where we
are

01:41:53.930 --> 01:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
that's okay thank you Mr chairman
 
01:41:57.890 --> 01:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
Cordell Johnston representing the New
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association in
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
 
01:42:04.250 --> 01:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
uh I want to point out there have been
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
several references to the bill that was
 
01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
passed last year this is nothing like
 
01:42:12.890 --> 01:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1460 as as the house passed
 
01:42:16.669 --> 01:42:16.679 align:start position:0%
it last year uh House Bill 1460
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh merely said that the budget committee
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
may require a governing body to provide
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
its budget recommendations in full line
 
01:42:30.169 --> 01:42:30.179 align:start position:0%
item detail in active spreadsheet format
 
01:42:33.050 --> 01:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
so that was if the if the town or School
 
01:42:35.870 --> 01:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
District's budget committee requests
 
01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
that then the governing body shall
 
01:42:40.370 --> 01:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
provide it but this was not a state
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
mandate as these bills are I'm gonna I'm
 
01:42:45.950 --> 01:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
gonna Focus my testimony on the
 
01:42:48.890 --> 01:42:48.900 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill 243 because it
 
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
seems to be the intent that everything
 
01:42:53.149 --> 01:42:53.159 align:start position:0%
to be incorporated into that
 
01:42:53.159 --> 01:42:53.930 align:start position:0%
to be incorporated into that
um

01:42:53.930 --> 01:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:57.290 --> 01:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
and I I mostly agree with uh with what
 
01:42:59.209 --> 01:42:59.219 align:start position:0%
Barrett Christina said and so I won't
 
01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
repeat that
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
um although I think actually there's a
 
01:43:06.109 --> 01:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
misreading of this 30-day requirement at
 
01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
least as it's put into the bill
 
01:43:10.189 --> 01:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
this is not a requirement that the
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
budget be done 30 days before the
 
01:43:15.410 --> 01:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
hearing uh as it's written it's a
 
01:43:18.169 --> 01:43:18.179 align:start position:0%
requirement that the department heads
 
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
get their revenue and expenditure to the
 
01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
governing body at least 30 days before
 
01:43:27.890 --> 01:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
the public hearing uh now that's usually
 
01:43:30.530 --> 01:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
more like several months before the
 
01:43:32.330 --> 01:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
public hearing so I don't know whether
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
that language was inserted in the wrong
 
01:43:36.169 --> 01:43:36.179 align:start position:0%
place but
 
01:43:36.179 --> 01:43:36.830 align:start position:0%
place but
um

01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
as it is that 30-day issue I don't think
 
01:43:42.649 --> 01:43:42.659 align:start position:0%
is a problem but if if the intent is
 
01:43:44.689 --> 01:43:44.699 align:start position:0%
that the budget be done 30 days before
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
the public hearing then that would be a
 
01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:48.109 align:start position:0%
the public hearing then that would be a
problem

01:43:48.109 --> 01:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
our major concern is that this bill is
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
essentially trying to micromanage how
 
01:43:57.410 --> 01:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
municipalities do their budgeting
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
um and based on the idea that what what
 
01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
has worked for some towns uh should be
 
01:44:08.689 --> 01:44:08.699 align:start position:0%
forced on every other town
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
um and you know we have municipalities
 
01:44:15.530 --> 01:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
uh from uh all the way from Manchester
 
01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
with a hundred and ten thousand
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
population to Hearts location with about
 
01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.410 align:start position:0%
population to Hearts location with about
44.

01:44:21.410 --> 01:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
44.
 
01:44:24.290 --> 01:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
what works for one doesn't necessarily
 
01:44:26.689 --> 01:44:26.699 align:start position:0%
work for all of the others
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
um there in in the various bills and
 
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
again I'm focusing on the amendment to
 
01:44:35.209 --> 01:44:35.219 align:start position:0%
House Bill 243 uh it talks about
 
01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
publishing the draft budget Publishers
 
01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
not defined there has been some
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
discussion on the committee about what
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
that means
 
01:44:46.729 --> 01:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
I think the assumption is that it will
 
01:44:49.370 --> 01:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
be published on the town's website
 
01:44:53.209 --> 01:44:53.219 align:start position:0%
not every town has a website that may uh
 
01:44:55.310 --> 01:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
come as a surprise but I know there are
 
01:44:57.169 --> 01:44:57.179 align:start position:0%
at least half a dozen towns that still
 
01:44:59.090 --> 01:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
do not have a website
 
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh this also would apply to Village
 
01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:02.330 align:start position:0%
uh this also would apply to Village
districts

01:45:02.330 --> 01:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:45:04.850 --> 01:45:04.860 align:start position:0%
uh and a lot of very tiny village
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
districts and I'm guessing that some of
 
01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
them don't have websites either
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
um the requirements that uh budgets be
 
01:45:17.629 --> 01:45:17.639 align:start position:0%
published in full line item Detail full
 
01:45:21.169 --> 01:45:21.179 align:start position:0%
line item detail is not defined and so
 
01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
people can have I've asked uh probably
 
01:45:26.450 --> 01:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
10 different people who work with
 
01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
budgets what is the definition of full
 
01:45:31.729 --> 01:45:31.739 align:start position:0%
line item detail and they say well I
 
01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
kind of know what it means but there is
 
01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
there is no standard definition so
 
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
people are going to have different ideas
 
01:45:39.530 --> 01:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:40.870 align:start position:0%
about that
um

01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:45.649 --> 01:45:45.659 align:start position:0%
note that this this bill applies to uh
 
01:45:47.209 --> 01:45:47.219 align:start position:0%
towns school districts and Village
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
districts it does not apply to the state
 
01:45:54.169 --> 01:45:54.179 align:start position:0%
or the counties so we're not requiring
 
01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
current this this would not require that
 
01:45:58.669 --> 01:45:58.679 align:start position:0%
the state publish its budget in this
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
manner and the state doesn't
 
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh if you ask the house finance
 
01:46:06.169 --> 01:46:06.179 align:start position:0%
committee for a copy of the state budget
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get full line item
 
01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:09.890 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get full line item
detail

01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
detail
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know about County budgets
 
01:46:16.370 --> 01:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
but I I suspect the same is true there
 
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
um I actually agree with much of what uh
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
Ms Green said about uh being up being
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
about a school board being unable to get
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
the full line item detailed budget from
 
01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
the superintendent
 
01:46:33.649 --> 01:46:33.659 align:start position:0%
um there's no reason that the school
 
01:46:35.810 --> 01:46:35.820 align:start position:0%
board shouldn't be able to get the the
 
01:46:38.689 --> 01:46:38.699 align:start position:0%
full line item detailed budget if it
 
01:46:41.149 --> 01:46:41.159 align:start position:0%
exists from the superintendent but
 
01:46:43.010 --> 01:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
that's an issue between the the school
 
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
board and the administration
 
01:46:47.209 --> 01:46:47.219 align:start position:0%
this this bill doesn't deal with that
 
01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
this bill says the school the school
 
01:46:52.970 --> 01:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
board or the Select Management the town
 
01:46:57.950 --> 01:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
um what what Ms Green and some of the
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
other Witnesses have talked about I
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
think is really a frustration with being
 
01:47:07.970 --> 01:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
able to get information
 
01:47:11.570 --> 01:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
um it should be understood that whatever
 
01:47:15.129 --> 01:47:15.139 align:start position:0%
form of budget the governing body has
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
you already have a right to get that
 
01:47:20.090 --> 01:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
from the governing body you can walk
 
01:47:22.129 --> 01:47:22.139 align:start position:0%
into town hall or you can call or email
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
and say I want to see the budget that
 
01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
the that the Selectmen are working on or
 
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
that the school board is is working on
 
01:47:34.910 --> 01:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
and under RSA 91a they have to give that
 
01:47:37.010 --> 01:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
to you and they have to give it to you
 
01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
in in paper form if you want it or if
 
01:47:41.629 --> 01:47:41.639 align:start position:0%
you wanted an electronic form and they
 
01:47:44.090 --> 01:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
have it in electronic form and they can
 
01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:47.219 align:start position:0%
give it to you that way they have to
 
01:47:49.370 --> 01:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
um if if you wanna
 
01:47:52.010 --> 01:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
amend the law to to make it clear that
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
that whatever the governing body has
 
01:47:57.550 --> 01:47:57.560 align:start position:0%
must be made available to the citizens
 
01:47:59.870 --> 01:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
that's fine except I think that's
 
01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
already clear
 
01:48:03.890 --> 01:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
in RSA 91a
 
01:48:05.090 --> 01:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
um and if there are people who are
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
unable to get that then it may be
 
01:48:11.629 --> 01:48:11.639 align:start position:0%
because someone's violating RSI RSA 91a
 
01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
but that's that's a different issue
 
01:48:16.850 --> 01:48:16.860 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:48:19.010 --> 01:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
um that's already the law and that's
 
01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:22.739 align:start position:0%
just a matter of someone voting
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it requires a change to
 
01:48:26.930 --> 01:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
the law so I'll end there but I mean
 
01:48:28.750 --> 01:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
just basically Our concern is
 
01:48:31.790 --> 01:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
micromanaging uh Municipal budgeting and
 
01:48:33.530 --> 01:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
saying you know the state doesn't have
 
01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:35.639 align:start position:0%
to do this but every city in town in the
 
01:48:37.490 --> 01:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
state does have to do it
 
01:48:39.169 --> 01:48:39.179 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to try to answer any
 
01:48:41.870 --> 01:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative magic Pootie
 
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr Johnson
 
01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question from your
 
01:48:50.330 --> 01:48:50.340 align:start position:0%
testimony and having served on school
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
board and other uh boards here it seems
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
like this is
 
01:49:00.410 --> 01:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
putting the responsibility on the local
 
01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:01.750 align:start position:0%
putting the responsibility on the local
government

01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:49:04.010 --> 01:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates
 
01:49:08.209 --> 01:49:08.219 align:start position:0%
and expecting our professionally hired
 
01:49:08.219 --> 01:49:10.189 align:start position:0%
and expecting our professionally hired
people

01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:49:13.010 --> 01:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
needing to
 
01:49:16.669 --> 01:49:16.679 align:start position:0%
do I mean hamstringing their ability to
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
do their job is that am I correct
 
01:49:23.330 --> 01:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
well I I think to some extent I and I'm
 
01:49:25.970 --> 01:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
not going to overstate it I'm I'm sure
 
01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
there are many municipalities where uh
 
01:49:31.310 --> 01:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
they have people who can do this already
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
and they have the software and and they
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
probably can do it without any
 
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
additional expense
 
01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
but I suspect there are somewhere that's
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
not the case and if if it does require
 
01:49:44.689 --> 01:49:44.699 align:start position:0%
any additional expense and I'm not
 
01:49:46.850 --> 01:49:46.860 align:start position:0%
saying it will but if it does that would
 
01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh right now I see no additional
 
01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:56.270 align:start position:0%
okay uh right now I see no additional
questions

01:49:56.270 --> 01:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:57.709 align:start position:0%
questions
um

01:49:57.709 --> 01:49:57.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:01.010 --> 01:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:03.050 --> 01:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
hoping to testify
 
01:50:05.810 --> 01:50:05.820 align:start position:0%
uh chair I think we have one other
 
01:50:08.510 --> 01:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
speaker if I have it right reconciling
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
the three testimony list and that might
 
01:50:12.050 --> 01:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
be Eric power
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
or they would be Eric power if I re if
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
I've reconciled all the lists correctly
 
01:50:19.970 --> 01:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
okay Mr power would you like to uh
 
01:50:24.890 --> 01:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:26.930 --> 01:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
hello this is uh Eric power can you hear
 
01:50:29.090 --> 01:50:29.100 align:start position:0%
me yes you sound fine go right ahead
 
01:50:31.370 --> 01:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm a resident of Brookline
 
01:50:34.729 --> 01:50:34.739 align:start position:0%
and I always also uh the chair of a
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
study committee to look at a budget
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
Committee in Brookline it was chartered
 
01:50:40.430 --> 01:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
last year during our town meeting
 
01:50:42.590 --> 01:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
so as the chair of that I looked at all
 
01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
things budget committee over the past
 
01:50:46.430 --> 01:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
year and we're actually having a warn
 
01:50:48.530 --> 01:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
article to adopt the budget committee at
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
this town meeting
 
01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
but in the process of that I've talked
 
01:50:55.010 --> 01:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
to many budget communities in advisory
 
01:50:57.530 --> 01:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
budget committees across the state and
 
01:50:59.870 --> 01:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
it is something that I've come across in
 
01:51:01.250 --> 01:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
talking to them
 
01:51:03.050 --> 01:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
learning about budget committees is that
 
01:51:06.169 --> 01:51:06.179 align:start position:0%
this is a problem that budget committees
 
01:51:08.570 --> 01:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
cannot get the budget information that
 
01:51:12.290 --> 01:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
they need in a timely manner and that's
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
one of the disadvantages I've seen of
 
01:51:16.370 --> 01:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
having a budget committee because they
 
01:51:19.010 --> 01:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
have a fiduciary responsibility to do
 
01:51:21.649 --> 01:51:21.659 align:start position:0%
the budget but then they're prevented
 
01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:23.820 align:start position:0%
from getting the information in the form
 
01:51:25.970 --> 01:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
that's needed that's why I think that
 
01:51:28.910 --> 01:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is very very important most
 
01:51:31.070 --> 01:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
almost all municipalities are using
 
01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
software this is not really putting any
 
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
burden on anybody
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
to provide that to the budget committee
 
01:51:39.649 --> 01:51:39.659 align:start position:0%
and it actually makes it easier for them
 
01:51:43.250 --> 01:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
to do their job so I would recommend for
 
01:51:45.709 --> 01:51:45.719 align:start position:0%
this uh for this bill and thank you for
 
01:51:47.450 --> 01:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony
 
01:51:50.510 --> 01:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
any are there any further questions
 
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
from the committee for those who have
 
01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:55.510 align:start position:0%
from the committee for those who have
testified

01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:58.570 --> 01:51:58.580 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh we're going to end the uh
 
01:52:01.729 --> 01:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
the hearings on two four three four one
 
01:52:03.709 --> 01:52:03.719 align:start position:0%
five and four five four
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to move on to our next bill
 
01:52:17.649 --> 01:52:17.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.410 --> 01:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
552 is a a bill about uh
 
01:52:24.830 --> 01:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
a suspending uh revaluations of uh of
 
01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:26.030 align:start position:0%
a suspending uh revaluations of uh of
property

01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:52:29.209 --> 01:52:29.219 align:start position:0%
uh do we have a a member that wishes to
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
testify that may be a sponsor of this
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
bill it's not indicated to me on my list
 
01:52:37.070 --> 01:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
of those who wish to testify but is that
 
01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:40.330 align:start position:0%
of those who wish to testify but is that
uh

01:52:40.330 --> 01:52:40.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.370 --> 01:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
well Mr chair I do see the prime I
 
01:52:45.649 --> 01:52:45.659 align:start position:0%

01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps we have an immune issue with
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
Miss Pitts
 
01:53:16.729 --> 01:53:16.739 align:start position:0%

yes go right here yes uh good morning uh
 
01:54:37.010 --> 01:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee my
 
01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
name is Norm Bernice I am the director
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
of assessing for the town of Hanover
 
01:54:45.410 --> 01:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
um I uh luckily or unluckily uh assume
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
this job a week before covet hit last
 
01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
year and then we were under a board
 
01:54:53.689 --> 01:54:53.699 align:start position:0%
order uh New Hampshire Board of tax land
 
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
appeals ordered revaluation to be
 
01:54:59.090 --> 01:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
completed in 2021
 
01:55:01.729 --> 01:55:01.739 align:start position:0%
we are well on our way to doing that
 
01:55:03.590 --> 01:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
um I I think
 
01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
um that uh other communities using
 
01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
cobiza as an excuse to not do the job of
 
01:55:13.609 --> 01:55:13.619 align:start position:0%
uh making sure that taxes are fair is
 
01:55:13.619 --> 01:55:15.229 align:start position:0%
uh making sure that taxes are fair is
probably

01:55:15.229 --> 01:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:55:18.590 --> 01:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
um not a good thing in fact we've had
 
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
great success with covid believe it or
 
01:55:24.770 --> 01:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
not because everyone is home so we've
 
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
communicated uh actually well well above
 
01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
what we would normally communicate with
 
01:55:32.410 --> 01:55:32.420 align:start position:0%
with our citizenry
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
we've reached out to them in many ways
 
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
we do uh we're actually doing some uh
 
01:55:40.729 --> 01:55:40.739 align:start position:0%
internal inspections uh being social
 
01:55:43.550 --> 01:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
distance we're also um
 
01:55:48.290 --> 01:55:48.300 align:start position:0%
uh doing uh FaceTime and zoom meetings
 
01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
and having them walk through the house
 
01:55:52.609 --> 01:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
and and and having a quite an
 
01:55:55.609 --> 01:55:55.619 align:start position:0%
interaction with the with our uh our
 
01:55:58.370 --> 01:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
community so we're looking at it as a as
 
01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
a success at this point and I think
 
01:56:05.090 --> 01:56:05.100 align:start position:0%
to suspend what what appears to me to be
 
01:56:08.169 --> 01:56:08.179 align:start position:0%
picking up all building permits
 
01:56:10.970 --> 01:56:10.980 align:start position:0%
just stop stopping the assessing
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
function of valuing property I think
 
01:56:17.330 --> 01:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
creates an inequity in and of itself
 
01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
um and and I opposed that and I think
 
01:56:22.490 --> 01:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
Hanover is doing the right thing and uh
 
01:56:23.950 --> 01:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there are a lot of other
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
contractors out there that um have
 
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
contracts and and uh it just would uh
 
01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
probably hurt their ability to do their
 
01:56:35.870 --> 01:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
job if the towns were to uh uh try to
 
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
spend the contract because of covid
 
01:56:39.709 --> 01:56:39.719 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what the impetus of the
 
01:56:42.350 --> 01:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
bill was was it just a safety issue or
 
01:56:45.950 --> 01:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
was it um Rising values of residential
 
01:56:47.450 --> 01:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
property as opposed to commercial
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
property and then having a tax shift so
 
01:56:52.609 --> 01:56:52.619 align:start position:0%
I I don't know what the what the impetus
 
01:56:54.530 --> 01:56:54.540 align:start position:0%
of the bill is and we haven't heard of
 
01:56:55.850 --> 01:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
obviously we're gonna hear from the
 
01:56:57.850 --> 01:56:57.860 align:start position:0%
sponsor at some point but
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
time to Hanover and myself were were
 
01:57:03.050 --> 01:57:03.060 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill and I'll take any
 
01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
questions uh Miss Pitts has uh been able
 
01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
to navigate through through our uh our
 
01:57:10.250 --> 01:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
Zoom meeting so if you could take
 
01:57:12.109 --> 01:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
yourself off mute I would certainly uh
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:20.510 --> 01:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative Maggiore is any way to
 
01:57:23.570 --> 01:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
get her up or mute from your desktop I'm
 
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
certainly trying oh there you go
 
01:57:29.290 --> 01:57:29.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:31.490 --> 01:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
we might need representative Pitts a
 
01:57:32.689 --> 01:57:32.699 align:start position:0%
calling from her phone I'll be looking
 
01:57:34.370 --> 01:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
to Christine for some help too because
 
01:57:36.410 --> 01:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
it looks like everything on this end she
 
01:57:39.530 --> 01:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
should be okay but clearly not miss
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
Pitts uh can you give us a thumbs up if
 
01:57:45.169 --> 01:57:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:47.209 --> 01:57:47.219 align:start position:0%
I don't think she can hear us either so
 
01:57:47.219 --> 01:57:48.350 align:start position:0%
I don't think she can hear us either so
uh

01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll see if we can get her on the
 
01:57:52.609 --> 01:57:52.619 align:start position:0%
telephone uh like we did with uh
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman earlier
 
01:57:57.709 --> 01:57:57.719 align:start position:0%
uh oh it looks like I'm getting a
 
01:57:59.570 --> 01:57:59.580 align:start position:0%
message from representative Gallagher he
 
01:58:03.229 --> 01:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:05.450 --> 01:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
does anybody else having trouble with
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
so representative Gallagher um what I
 
01:58:15.950 --> 01:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
may suggest you do as a first effort to
 
01:58:18.770 --> 01:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
troubleshoot is to log off the zoom and
 
01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:19.669 align:start position:0%
troubleshoot is to log off the zoom and
re

01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
re
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
and re-engage the zoom to see if that
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
helps uh your connection try that as a
 
01:58:28.250 --> 01:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
first uh a first effort to troubleshoot
 
01:58:31.250 --> 01:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you can hear me
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
yes okay yes is that Miss Pitts no this
 
01:58:37.490 --> 01:58:37.500 align:start position:0%

01:58:45.950 --> 01:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:48.290 --> 01:58:48.300 align:start position:0%
I just needed to check my audio Mr chair

01:58:57.649 --> 01:58:57.659 align:start position:0%
uh Callie Pitts to see if maybe she can
 
01:59:00.129 --> 01:59:00.139 align:start position:0%
call in from her phone
 
01:59:03.229 --> 01:59:03.239 align:start position:0%

01:59:06.109 --> 01:59:06.119 align:start position:0%

01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
okay well in the meantime let's go maybe
 
01:59:14.990 --> 01:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
because of the wind and the power
 
01:59:17.390 --> 01:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
outages and stuff over the last couple
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
of days people having difficulty with
 
01:59:21.250 --> 01:59:21.260 align:start position:0%
their phone lines
 
01:59:25.209 --> 01:59:25.219 align:start position:0%
do we have uh uh Jim misho on the line
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
Sorry I will go back
 
01:59:30.169 --> 01:59:30.179 align:start position:0%
yes and
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
um I will say that he is all set to
 
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
speak but let's see if that actually
 
01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:34.669 align:start position:0%
speak but let's see if that actually
happens

01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now yeah yeah right
 
01:59:38.990 --> 01:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you very much for the
 
01:59:43.089 --> 01:59:43.099 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify in House Bill 552
 
01:59:45.709 --> 01:59:45.719 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Jimmy show I'm
 
01:59:47.089 --> 01:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
the chief assessor for the town of
 
01:59:49.250 --> 01:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
Hudson New Hampshire I'm also chair of
 
01:59:50.689 --> 01:59:50.699 align:start position:0%
the legislative committee for the New
 
01:59:52.129 --> 01:59:52.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of assessing
 
01:59:55.070 --> 01:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
officials I am speaking on my own behalf
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
I'm just giving you a little bit of
 
01:59:56.639 --> 01:59:58.310 align:start position:0%
I'm just giving you a little bit of
background

01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
background
 
02:00:00.770 --> 02:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not sure if this bill was
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
intended to be amended prior to this
 
02:00:04.609 --> 02:00:04.619 align:start position:0%
hearing I had heard some rumors about
 
02:00:06.950 --> 02:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
that but all I can go is based upon the
 
02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
writing of the bill as proposed
 
02:00:12.890 --> 02:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
um it is frankly way way too late in the
 
02:00:15.410 --> 02:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
process to suspend appraisal assessment
 
02:00:18.050 --> 02:00:18.060 align:start position:0%
and valuation updating for the 2021
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
property tax year
 
02:00:21.470 --> 02:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal assessing
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
officials have already done literally
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
thousands of changes to property values
 
02:00:27.770 --> 02:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
across the state as associated with
 
02:00:29.810 --> 02:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
items like building permits new
 
02:00:32.330 --> 02:00:32.340 align:start position:0%
construction property that has had fires
 
02:00:34.370 --> 02:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
and been damaged properties that were
 
02:00:36.050 --> 02:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
partially complete prayers of April 1st
 
02:00:39.169 --> 02:00:39.179 align:start position:0%
2020 that are now complete subdivisions
 
02:00:41.450 --> 02:00:41.460 align:start position:0%
site plans zoning changes zoning
 
02:00:43.970 --> 02:00:43.980 align:start position:0%
variances I could go on I don't want to
 
02:00:46.850 --> 02:00:46.860 align:start position:0%
take up all my time discussing that
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
it would be literally impossible to
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
efficiently and accurately unspill the
 
02:00:53.209 --> 02:00:53.219 align:start position:0%
milk undo all that work
 
02:00:55.669 --> 02:00:55.679 align:start position:0%
never mind how impeccable it would be to
 
02:00:57.950 --> 02:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
the state's taxpayers it would be a
 
02:00:59.810 --> 02:00:59.820 align:start position:0%
catastrophe for the goals of fair and
 
02:01:02.089 --> 02:01:02.099 align:start position:0%
equal assessments throughout the state
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
further who's going to pay for the state
 
02:01:06.589 --> 02:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
mandating the undoing of all this work
 
02:01:09.169 --> 02:01:09.179 align:start position:0%
where is the fiscal note where's the
 
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
budgetary appropriation from the state
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
to pay Municipal assessing officials
 
02:01:15.530 --> 02:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
budgets both contractor and employee I
 
02:01:17.330 --> 02:01:17.340 align:start position:0%
don't see that proposed
 
02:01:19.129 --> 02:01:19.139 align:start position:0%
in the budget process from the fall of
 
02:01:22.129 --> 02:01:22.139 align:start position:0%
2020 in anticipation of the 21 property
 
02:01:23.209 --> 02:01:23.219 align:start position:0%
tax year
 
02:01:25.129 --> 02:01:25.139 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire municipalities typically
 
02:01:27.229 --> 02:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
anticipate how much tax-based growth
 
02:01:29.629 --> 02:01:29.639 align:start position:0%
change is going to occur and in part
 
02:01:31.790 --> 02:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
based budgetary appropriation decisions
 
02:01:34.669 --> 02:01:34.679 align:start position:0%
on that now if values are not allowed to
 
02:01:36.830 --> 02:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
be updated that is going to potentially
 
02:01:47.770 --> 02:01:47.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:52.850 --> 02:01:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:54.910 --> 02:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
I I think I might have found there we go
 
02:01:57.229 --> 02:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
representative Pitts if you could Callie
 
02:01:59.149 --> 02:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
Pitts if you can hear me I have you on
 
02:02:01.310 --> 02:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
mute it seems that with your call-in
 
02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
it's causing that
 
02:02:05.570 --> 02:02:05.580 align:start position:0%
um and and so I'm just going to ask if
 
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
if you unmute can you hear us and can we
 
02:02:12.290 --> 02:02:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:12.300 --> 02:02:37.089 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:02:37.089 --> 02:02:37.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:39.709 --> 02:02:39.719 align:start position:0%
can I testify
 
02:02:41.870 --> 02:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
or somebody else I can't
 
02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:43.250 align:start position:0%
or somebody else I can't
hello

02:02:43.250 --> 02:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
hello
 
02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
yes we can hear you representative Pitts
 
02:02:48.410 --> 02:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if Mr misho is is I
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
don't know either
 
02:02:53.689 --> 02:02:53.699 align:start position:0%
I I will I will finish up
 
02:02:57.050 --> 02:02:57.060 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now yes okay so so I
 
02:02:58.729 --> 02:02:58.739 align:start position:0%
will finish up um if the point is to
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
delay any potential tax increase tax
 
02:03:03.530 --> 02:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
increase based on Market escalation and
 
02:03:06.410 --> 02:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
sales prices delaying for one year will
 
02:03:08.450 --> 02:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
only likely exacerbate the assessment
 
02:03:10.189 --> 02:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
difference and resulting tax differences
 
02:03:12.169 --> 02:03:12.179 align:start position:0%
for the following year
 
02:03:14.570 --> 02:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
this simply isn't a good public policy
 
02:03:16.189 --> 02:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
bill and I would ask for the committee
 
02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
to itl it
 
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
that are all my comments I'll answer any
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
questions and I'll stay on the line
 
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
chairman Dolan
 
02:03:29.930 --> 02:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
you have two questions here in the LLB
 
02:03:36.410 --> 02:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yes uh who who has a
 
02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:38.169 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yes uh who who has a
question

02:03:38.169 --> 02:03:38.179 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles representative
 
02:03:43.490 --> 02:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
Styles go ahead please
 
02:03:47.689 --> 02:03:47.699 align:start position:0%
yes a question for Mr Michelle uh we
 
02:03:50.830 --> 02:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
haven't heard yet what the purpose
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
or goal of this uh bill is but if it is
 
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
to discontinue assessments because of
 
02:04:07.790 --> 02:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
difficulties with the covid crisis uh I
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
would like for you to reflect uh if you
 
02:04:15.010 --> 02:04:15.020 align:start position:0%
have seen those types of difficulties
 
02:04:18.050 --> 02:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
and how easy was it for you to get
 
02:04:20.089 --> 02:04:20.099 align:start position:0%
around it
 
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
so uh certainly commensurate with with
 
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
most Industries uh the pandemic has had
 
02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
a a fairly uh good impact upon not good
 
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
but for a fairly difficult impact on on
 
02:04:34.370 --> 02:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
doing our job
 
02:04:36.530 --> 02:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
um in in Hudson
 
02:04:38.330 --> 02:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
um you know we've established continuity
 
02:04:40.669 --> 02:04:40.679 align:start position:0%
operations plans we've gone half remote
 
02:04:42.890 --> 02:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
half in person
 
02:04:45.050 --> 02:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
um for a good part of last year we were
 
02:04:47.870 --> 02:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
not going inside properties we were
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
accepting people's videos
 
02:04:52.070 --> 02:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
um we were accepting information from
 
02:04:53.390 --> 02:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
obviously from the building department
 
02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
inspectional Services
 
02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
um you know just doing our best to do a
 
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
work around and obtain the most accurate
 
02:05:02.810 --> 02:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
data that we can
 
02:05:05.149 --> 02:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
um we didn't just stop doing our job
 
02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
because it was difficult we just did our
 
02:05:09.470 --> 02:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
best to work around it we followed
 
02:05:12.050 --> 02:05:12.060 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration uh
 
02:05:14.209 --> 02:05:14.219 align:start position:0%
technical information releases on this
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
we communicated with other communities
 
02:05:18.290 --> 02:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
uh what are you doing in your community
 
02:05:20.089 --> 02:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
that seems to be working
 
02:05:22.189 --> 02:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
but you know in in Hudson because of a
 
02:05:24.589 --> 02:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
you know a higher uh positivity rate for
 
02:05:26.689 --> 02:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
much of last year uh certainly in the
 
02:05:26.699 --> 02:05:27.830 align:start position:0%
much of last year uh certainly in the
fall

02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
fall
 
02:05:29.930 --> 02:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
um you know we we really didn't do a lot
 
02:05:32.149 --> 02:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
of interior review but we did our best
 
02:05:34.370 --> 02:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
to work around it
 
02:05:38.570 --> 02:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:40.129 --> 02:05:40.139 align:start position:0%
What would
 
02:05:41.810 --> 02:05:41.820 align:start position:0%
how would you
 
02:05:46.669 --> 02:05:46.679 align:start position:0%
assess the quality of your Assessment
 
02:05:46.679 --> 02:05:48.290 align:start position:0%
assess the quality of your Assessment
program

02:05:48.290 --> 02:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh during the crisis what what kind of a
 
02:05:54.169 --> 02:05:54.179 align:start position:0%
grade would you give it
 
02:05:55.550 --> 02:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:05:57.709 --> 02:05:57.719 align:start position:0%
um I'm not prepared to answer that
 
02:05:59.390 --> 02:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
question because it's like we're still
 
02:06:01.850 --> 02:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
in the middle of it towards the end of
 
02:06:03.229 --> 02:06:03.239 align:start position:0%
it maybe
 
02:06:04.370 --> 02:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
02:06:07.070 --> 02:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
that that that kind of uh after the fact
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
action report I just I haven't done that
 
02:06:10.850 --> 02:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
for my own board of selectment at this
 
02:06:12.589 --> 02:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
point so I'm not so sure I'm prepared to
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
testify in that this morning
 
02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
do you have a degree of confidence in
 
02:06:19.250 --> 02:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
your assessments
 
02:06:21.470 --> 02:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
yes I I do have a degree of confidence
 
02:06:22.970 --> 02:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
in the assessment
 
02:06:25.550 --> 02:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
um you know even before pandemic you
 
02:06:26.810 --> 02:06:26.820 align:start position:0%
know certainly there's properties that
 
02:06:28.970 --> 02:06:28.980 align:start position:0%
we never got into and
 
02:06:30.589 --> 02:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
um you use your best education and
 
02:06:33.109 --> 02:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
experience and knowledge to do your best
 
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
estimate of what is on the inside of
 
02:06:37.609 --> 02:06:37.619 align:start position:0%
that property uh many times you have
 
02:06:39.770 --> 02:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
some historical data
 
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
um you might be able to obtain some
 
02:06:42.649 --> 02:06:42.659 align:start position:0%
other data from the building permit
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
process obviously and certainly being on
 
02:06:47.209 --> 02:06:47.219 align:start position:0%
the property site whether it's on the
 
02:06:49.189 --> 02:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
site or from the street
 
02:06:51.050 --> 02:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
um you can you can glean a fair
 
02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:52.609 align:start position:0%
um you can you can glean a fair
indication

02:06:52.609 --> 02:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
indication
 
02:06:54.649 --> 02:06:54.659 align:start position:0%
um you would think about the interior of
 
02:06:56.570 --> 02:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
the property if it's if it looks okay on
 
02:06:58.070 --> 02:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
the outside it's probably okay on the
 
02:07:01.070 --> 02:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
inside though that's not always the case
 
02:07:03.470 --> 02:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
um I I I'd give a fair degree of
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
confidence in what we've done in terms
 
02:07:06.890 --> 02:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
of assessing property
 
02:07:10.490 --> 02:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr mishogi thank you sir
 
02:07:12.649 --> 02:07:12.659 align:start position:0%
Miss Pitts are you uh are you still with
 
02:07:12.659 --> 02:07:13.370 align:start position:0%
Miss Pitts are you uh are you still with
us

02:07:13.370 --> 02:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not a Miss I'm representative uh I
 
02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:17.810 align:start position:0%
I'm not a Miss I'm representative uh I
am

02:07:17.810 --> 02:07:17.820 align:start position:0%
am
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
oh please and I'm I I'm a little bit is
 
02:07:22.910 --> 02:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
this chairman Dolan I don't know who am
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
I speaking to because I got out of the
 
02:07:27.890 --> 02:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
meeting yes it is um I'm a little bit
 
02:07:30.290 --> 02:07:30.300 align:start position:0%
upset that I wasn't allowed to give a
 
02:07:31.490 --> 02:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
little bit of the history and the
 
02:07:32.990 --> 02:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
motivation first so I'm gonna go very
 
02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:33.830 align:start position:0%
motivation first so I'm gonna go very
fast

02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
fast
 
02:07:37.850 --> 02:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
with this what this was was a was a
 
02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Bill basically the selectman
 
02:07:43.850 --> 02:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
asked me the city council asked me to
 
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
put this bill in and I will advise you
 
02:07:49.370 --> 02:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
that the same exact verbiage that is in
 
02:07:52.370 --> 02:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
your hand now or that is in the bill now
 
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
is in Senate Bill 102 which is an
 
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill
 
02:08:00.709 --> 02:08:00.719 align:start position:0%
and so and and I'm sponsor on part of
 
02:08:03.589 --> 02:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
that Omnibus as well what the motivation
 
02:08:06.109 --> 02:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
behind this was as many people as we
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
were going around
 
02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
said you know with property values going
 
02:08:12.350 --> 02:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
up so high
 
02:08:14.930 --> 02:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
in in this particular area and lots of
 
02:08:17.330 --> 02:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
other areas I know Conway's experience
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
the same thing other towns are
 
02:08:21.169 --> 02:08:21.179 align:start position:0%
experiencing the same thing because we
 
02:08:23.689 --> 02:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
are having an influx of people people
 
02:08:25.310 --> 02:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
are being paid
 
02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:27.109 align:start position:0%
are being paid
more

02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
than they're asking for their property
 
02:08:32.810 --> 02:08:32.820 align:start position:0%
so that's good for the people
 
02:08:35.390 --> 02:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
but the people who are moving in with
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
the taxes sometimes that's not good and
 
02:08:40.189 --> 02:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
it might not be good for The Neighbor
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
Next Door whose property value will go
 
02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:43.729 align:start position:0%
Next Door whose property value will go
up

02:08:43.729 --> 02:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
when this was put in that was meant to
 
02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
stem the mandatory five-year assessment
 
02:08:54.290 --> 02:08:54.300 align:start position:0%
some towns don't assess every year
 
02:08:57.109 --> 02:08:57.119 align:start position:0%
because they don't have permanent
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
assessors like we do and so this year
 
02:09:04.850 --> 02:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
after this bill was filed I was informed
 
02:09:06.530 --> 02:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
that yeah don't worry about it
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth isn't going to reassess this
 
02:09:08.159 --> 02:09:08.990 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth isn't going to reassess this
year

02:09:08.990 --> 02:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:09:11.629 --> 02:09:11.639 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't have to be done in our
 
02:09:11.639 --> 02:09:12.649 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't have to be done in our
town

02:09:12.649 --> 02:09:12.659 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:09:16.129 --> 02:09:16.139 align:start position:0%
thinking about it a little bit more
 
02:09:19.250 --> 02:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
I thought the rest of the state there
 
02:09:21.950 --> 02:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
are places that are having a problem and
 
02:09:24.350 --> 02:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
all it was meant to do was put off that
 
02:09:28.430 --> 02:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
mandatory five years assessment for one
 
02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:30.350 align:start position:0%
mandatory five years assessment for one
year

02:09:30.350 --> 02:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:09:34.910 --> 02:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
that could cause as as someone stated
 
02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:35.450 align:start position:0%
that could cause as as someone stated
um

02:09:35.450 --> 02:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:37.490 --> 02:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
tax shock
 
02:09:39.410 --> 02:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
in the second year
 
02:09:42.649 --> 02:09:42.659 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't stop taxes it would use the
 
02:09:46.370 --> 02:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:49.129 --> 02:09:49.139 align:start position:0%
um through April 1st of 2020 so it's not
 
02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
going to stop taxes it's not going to
 
02:09:54.830 --> 02:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
change the education portion of what
 
02:09:56.209 --> 02:09:56.219 align:start position:0%
goes to the state
 
02:09:59.270 --> 02:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
but it's going to keep the line for some
 
02:10:02.750 --> 02:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
people again as an extraordinary measure
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
only because it is for the covid-19 for
 
02:10:10.189 --> 02:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
the purpose of covet 19. we're coming
 
02:10:14.030 --> 02:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
out of covid-19 now I I think I believe
 
02:10:16.729 --> 02:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
the governor has done an excellent job
 
02:10:21.770 --> 02:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
and we are starting to move forward
 
02:10:25.970 --> 02:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
and in my own opinion I did not want to
 
02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:26.770 align:start position:0%
and in my own opinion I did not want to
take

02:10:26.770 --> 02:10:26.780 align:start position:0%
take
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
additional property taxes as a step
 
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
backward that's all there was no no
 
02:10:35.570 --> 02:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
putting assessors out of their jobs no
 
02:10:40.430 --> 02:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
no use the 2020 and and try to hold the
 
02:10:43.250 --> 02:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
line for one year I think most places
 
02:10:46.370 --> 02:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
are doing that not only holding the line
 
02:10:49.250 --> 02:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
but a lot of towns including my city
 
02:10:50.830 --> 02:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
including my own
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh cutting budgets and
 
02:10:58.010 --> 02:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
that also is going to come because
 
02:11:00.109 --> 02:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
sooner or later you have to pay the
 
02:11:03.709 --> 02:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
piper but I think right now in this
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
particular time
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
too many people especially Property
 
02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
Owners uh are hurting and so our
 
02:11:14.270 --> 02:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
landlords I mean it goes across the
 
02:11:16.970 --> 02:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
board and it's got to be equal it's it's
 
02:11:19.850 --> 02:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
got to be just an equal so we mentioned
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
the other sras that's all it is it
 
02:11:25.070 --> 02:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't a mean-spirited bill it wasn't a
 
02:11:26.450 --> 02:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
bill to
 
02:11:30.229 --> 02:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
do any harm it was supposed to do good
 
02:11:33.530 --> 02:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
my recommendation on this bill
 
02:11:36.709 --> 02:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
would be that it be held and I know the
 
02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
the sponsor who a couple of the sponsors
 
02:11:40.970 --> 02:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
I said go ahead pull your name off the
 
02:11:42.890 --> 02:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
bill that's fine with me because they
 
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
were it's not going to affect the
 
02:11:47.330 --> 02:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
property the education tax no it won't
 
02:11:51.649 --> 02:11:51.659 align:start position:0%
but it may affect other things so I just
 
02:11:54.649 --> 02:11:54.659 align:start position:0%
would my recommendation and it's only my
 
02:11:56.570 --> 02:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be that it be
 
02:11:56.580 --> 02:11:58.250 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be that it be
retained

02:11:58.250 --> 02:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
retained
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
and take a look at what's happening in
 
02:12:01.910 --> 02:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate bill
 
02:12:05.450 --> 02:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not so sure Omnibus bills really go
 
02:12:05.460 --> 02:12:06.709 align:start position:0%
I'm not so sure Omnibus bills really go
anywhere

02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
02:12:10.669 --> 02:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
and then this can always be itl later
 
02:12:13.970 --> 02:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
I don't I I believe there is a need out
 
02:12:15.770 --> 02:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
there to do something
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
and this was just an attempt I believe
 
02:12:21.890 --> 02:12:21.900 align:start position:0%
you got a letter from Maya Beckstead
 
02:12:25.070 --> 02:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:27.649 --> 02:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
uh we may have I I don't have my hands
 
02:12:28.850 --> 02:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
on it right now
 
02:12:31.250 --> 02:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
okay I believe that there was a letter
 
02:12:34.010 --> 02:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
from uh the mayor of Portsmouth saying
 
02:12:35.689 --> 02:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
that this is not really a Portsmouth
 
02:12:38.089 --> 02:12:38.099 align:start position:0%
bill it is a state Bill and that's the
 
02:12:40.010 --> 02:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
end of it I mean that that's where it is
 
02:12:43.550 --> 02:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
so I I am done and I
 
02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
I know that there are all good
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
intentions and if the bill fails it
 
02:12:50.030 --> 02:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
fails but I certainly hope
 
02:12:52.729 --> 02:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
that somebody can come up with something
 
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
to offer relief
 
02:12:58.430 --> 02:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
to the property owners around the state
 
02:13:00.770 --> 02:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
especially those who have been in the
 
02:13:03.169 --> 02:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
state and have owned their homes for a
 
02:13:05.689 --> 02:13:05.699 align:start position:0%
long time and who are struggling
 
02:13:08.450 --> 02:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
thank you that's all
 
02:13:10.910 --> 02:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Maggiore do we
 
02:13:12.649 --> 02:13:12.659 align:start position:0%
have anyone else that uh
 
02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
has indicated they want to offer
 
02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:16.450 align:start position:0%
has indicated they want to offer
testimony

02:13:16.450 --> 02:13:16.460 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:13:19.189 --> 02:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
we have them well I'm sorry
 
02:13:22.010 --> 02:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
yeah she's representative power I I was
 
02:13:24.609 --> 02:13:24.619 align:start position:0%
multitasking earlier and I know that
 
02:13:27.290 --> 02:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp had his hand raised
 
02:13:29.810 --> 02:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
previously did was his question
 
02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
addressed I don't believe it was the
 
02:13:33.770 --> 02:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp do you have a
 
02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:35.750 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp do you have a
question

02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:13:38.510 --> 02:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
well my question thank you for taking my
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
question my question was the same as uh
 
02:13:44.810 --> 02:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
uh representative lasalles you know what
 
02:13:47.330 --> 02:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
is the purpose of this bill
 
02:13:51.169 --> 02:13:51.179 align:start position:0%
now apparently it's just a delay uh
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:57.950 --> 02:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
the the purpose of the bill was there's
 
02:14:01.250 --> 02:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
a mandatory mandatory five-year
 
02:14:04.129 --> 02:14:04.139 align:start position:0%
assessment so that if if towns and
 
02:14:05.689 --> 02:14:05.699 align:start position:0%
whatever every five years you at least
 
02:14:07.790 --> 02:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
have to reassess
 
02:14:10.430 --> 02:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
and so that that mandatory assessment
 
02:14:13.129 --> 02:14:13.139 align:start position:0%
for towns who assess every year or every
 
02:14:15.410 --> 02:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
other year not going to bother them but
 
02:14:18.169 --> 02:14:18.179 align:start position:0%
for that mandatory five-year assessment
 
02:14:21.709 --> 02:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
uh at this particular time would be
 
02:14:24.169 --> 02:14:24.179 align:start position:0%
waived for one year for the covid-19
 
02:14:24.179 --> 02:14:26.510 align:start position:0%
waived for one year for the covid-19
only

02:14:26.510 --> 02:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:14:28.669 --> 02:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
02:14:30.410 --> 02:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
yes I I
 
02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
go ahead I'm having a very hard time
 
02:14:34.850 --> 02:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
understanding go ahead
 
02:14:34.860 --> 02:14:35.990 align:start position:0%
understanding go ahead
well

02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
we're in the same situation I have a
 
02:14:40.089 --> 02:14:40.099 align:start position:0%
hard time understanding too so
 
02:14:44.930 --> 02:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
apparently there are some towns that uh
 
02:14:47.330 --> 02:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
assess weight
 
02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
the entire five years before doing any
 
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
assessment so there's going to be a
 
02:14:56.510 --> 02:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
a tack shock if they have to try this
 
02:15:00.169 --> 02:15:00.179 align:start position:0%
year well uh
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
it would it would also appear that uh
 
02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:04.550 align:start position:0%
it would it would also appear that uh
since

02:15:04.550 --> 02:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
since
 
02:15:06.890 --> 02:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
people haven't had their taxes increased
 
02:15:08.990 --> 02:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
for five years that they they benefited
 
02:15:12.770 --> 02:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
from a lower tax payment you know uh
 
02:15:14.689 --> 02:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
how does uh
 
02:15:17.870 --> 02:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
they're pushing this off another year to
 
02:15:21.069 --> 02:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:23.569 --> 02:15:23.579 align:start position:0%
I think it benefits the town because
 
02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
people who are struggling are going to
 
02:15:27.649 --> 02:15:27.659 align:start position:0%
be struggling are struggling in other
 
02:15:27.659 --> 02:15:28.609 align:start position:0%
be struggling are struggling in other
ways

02:15:28.609 --> 02:15:28.619 align:start position:0%
ways
 
02:15:31.129 --> 02:15:31.139 align:start position:0%
and I think that
 
02:15:34.129 --> 02:15:34.139 align:start position:0%
people and and again I haven't gone from
 
02:15:35.689 --> 02:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
town to town because I like everybody
 
02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
else I've been
 
02:15:40.729 --> 02:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
in my four walls but I do believe that
 
02:15:44.990 --> 02:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
once this once people are struggling if
 
02:15:46.310 --> 02:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
they come to the point where they're
 
02:15:48.589 --> 02:15:48.599 align:start position:0%
having problems with their
 
02:15:51.649 --> 02:15:51.659 align:start position:0%
pain especially their home tax that
 
02:15:54.410 --> 02:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
threatens the basic need for shelter and
 
02:15:56.330 --> 02:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
I think once you threaten that basic
 
02:15:58.970 --> 02:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
need for shelter then you come upon
 
02:16:01.430 --> 02:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
other problems you come upon social
 
02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
problems you come upon uh police
 
02:16:06.530 --> 02:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
problems you come up you come upon all
 
02:16:09.229 --> 02:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
kinds of problems the idea is to like
 
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
release the valve on the pressure cooker
 
02:16:14.209 --> 02:16:14.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:17.030 --> 02:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh do we do we have uh
 
02:16:19.370 --> 02:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
represent Gallagher the I'm not sure do
 
02:16:23.149 --> 02:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
um no I
 
02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:30.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:32.270 --> 02:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative power do you have you
 
02:16:35.089 --> 02:16:35.099 align:start position:0%
have a yes um representative McDonald's
 
02:16:38.089 --> 02:16:38.099 align:start position:0%
would like to ask a question okay
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:44.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:47.209 --> 02:16:47.219 align:start position:0%
so if we patch this
 
02:16:47.219 --> 02:16:49.009 align:start position:0%
so if we patch this
yo

02:16:49.009 --> 02:16:49.019 align:start position:0%
yo
 
02:16:50.750 --> 02:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
you're gonna have to deal with it four
 
02:16:52.669 --> 02:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
more years to be compliant with the
 
02:16:56.209 --> 02:16:56.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:59.330 --> 02:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
no you would have to do it the next year
 
02:17:03.770 --> 02:17:03.780 align:start position:0%
we are suspending for one year
 
02:17:05.870 --> 02:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
is that what it says that five-year
 
02:17:08.209 --> 02:17:08.219 align:start position:0%
mandate that that the legislature quite
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%
frankly put in
 
02:17:12.650 --> 02:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
put in so we are suspending that for one
 
02:17:12.660 --> 02:17:15.110 align:start position:0%
put in so we are suspending that for one
year

02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:20.030 --> 02:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
that's all not paying your taxes but you
 
02:17:23.209 --> 02:17:23.219 align:start position:0%
would pay the rate from 20
 
02:17:23.219 --> 02:17:26.030 align:start position:0%
would pay the rate from 20
20.

02:17:26.030 --> 02:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
20.
 
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
02:17:30.169 --> 02:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
and you will follow up Mr chairman yeah
 
02:17:32.750 --> 02:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead and have a follow-up
 
02:17:43.299 --> 02:17:43.309 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:43.309 --> 02:17:52.429 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:17:52.429 --> 02:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:53.929 --> 02:17:53.939 align:start position:0%
that was one of those would you believe
 
02:17:56.589 --> 02:17:56.599 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Kelly Pitts
 
02:17:59.270 --> 02:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
I believe anything that Municipal and
 
02:18:01.250 --> 02:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
county says because I think you uh
 
02:18:03.530 --> 02:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
people are more knowledgeable on this
 
02:18:05.870 --> 02:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
subject than than I am
 
02:18:09.169 --> 02:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
but I do think that there is some need
 
02:18:12.830 --> 02:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
to provide for the individual taxpayer
 
02:18:15.950 --> 02:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
not only businesses but the individual
 
02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:18.530 align:start position:0%
not only businesses but the individual
taxpayer

02:18:18.530 --> 02:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
02:18:18.540 --> 02:18:20.469 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
um

02:18:20.469 --> 02:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:24.049 --> 02:18:24.059 align:start position:0%
some relief and this was one way to do
 
02:18:26.509 --> 02:18:26.519 align:start position:0%
it it may not be the best and I'm going
 
02:18:27.950 --> 02:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
to admit that
 
02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:29.870 align:start position:0%
to admit that
but

02:18:29.870 --> 02:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:18:32.990 --> 02:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
all it does is say that we can suspend
 
02:18:36.169 --> 02:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
that one year
 
02:18:36.179 --> 02:18:38.929 align:start position:0%
that one year
of

02:18:38.929 --> 02:18:38.939 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:18:42.349 --> 02:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
assessment that's mandated in the law
 
02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's all representative and if there's
 
02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
a better way to do that I respect you
 
02:18:49.730 --> 02:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
for that representative Kelly Pitts this
 
02:18:52.129 --> 02:18:52.139 align:start position:0%
is uh chairman Dolan I just as a kind of
 
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question
 
02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
you representative McDonald's question
 
02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
so if one third of their Town based on
 
02:19:04.250 --> 02:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
their re-evaluation taxes were going to
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
go down
 
02:19:09.650 --> 02:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
by suspending this that would not allow
 
02:19:12.650 --> 02:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
their taxes to go down how what what
 
02:19:15.169 --> 02:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
would you say that we would have to say
 
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
to those people that were anticipating a
 
02:19:21.410 --> 02:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
tax reduction based on new valuation
 
02:19:24.349 --> 02:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
based on the value on the valuation for
 
02:19:29.209 --> 02:19:29.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:33.709 --> 02:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
um that I would say is going to be an
 
02:19:33.719 --> 02:19:35.589 align:start position:0%
um that I would say is going to be an
equitable

02:19:35.589 --> 02:19:35.599 align:start position:0%
equitable
 
02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
decision for those people whose taxes
 
02:19:40.370 --> 02:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
won't go now
 
02:19:43.250 --> 02:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
okay any one-third and based on
 
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
one-third now what if you have the full
 
02:19:48.670 --> 02:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
thing you are suspending for one year
 
02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
that five-year valuation so you don't do
 
02:19:55.370 --> 02:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
the evaluation every
 
02:19:58.370 --> 02:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
every five years I'm assuming
 
02:20:01.969 --> 02:20:01.979 align:start position:0%
so that you certainly can adjust the tax
 
02:20:04.750 --> 02:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
rate that way
 
02:20:08.450 --> 02:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
I would look at this as enabling but we
 
02:20:10.750 --> 02:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't do that because we had to say
 
02:20:15.230 --> 02:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
that this is universal because part of
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
the Constitution it has to be
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
Equitable across the board okay I'd like
 
02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
to kind of wrap here uh representative I
 
02:20:24.830 --> 02:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
would too I have you have a final
 
02:20:24.840 --> 02:20:27.429 align:start position:0%
would too I have you have a final
question

02:20:27.429 --> 02:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
no I I would just like to say that I
 
02:20:35.630 --> 02:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
hold on a second I came with since we
 
02:20:38.090 --> 02:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
question from Representatives Davis I'm
 
02:20:40.130 --> 02:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
a half hour late for another meeting go
 
02:20:40.140 --> 02:20:41.330 align:start position:0%
a half hour late for another meeting go
ahead

02:20:41.330 --> 02:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
02:20:43.370 --> 02:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Kelly Pitts for
 
02:20:45.710 --> 02:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question just very sure are
 
02:20:48.290 --> 02:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
you aware of any other states
 
02:20:50.630 --> 02:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
that are trying to implement similar
 
02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:52.849 align:start position:0%
that are trying to implement similar
efforts

02:20:52.849 --> 02:20:52.859 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
no I am not thank you
 
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you for staying
 
02:21:00.770 --> 02:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
over representative I appreciate your
 
02:21:03.290 --> 02:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
testimony and good luck with your with
 
02:21:06.050 --> 02:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
your next meeting that's on aggregated
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
community power please
 
02:21:11.750 --> 02:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
I I would just say this
 
02:21:16.130 --> 02:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
if this one goes down you know I don't
 
02:21:18.770 --> 02:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
get heartburn over it but it is going to
 
02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
be contained in that Senate bill which
 
02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
may or may not come across so the idea
 
02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh foreign it's not something that's
 
02:21:34.130 --> 02:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
out of the question
 
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
I didn't go soliciting sponsors because
 
02:21:39.110 --> 02:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of people were hesitant but if you
 
02:21:41.929 --> 02:21:41.939 align:start position:0%
look at Senate Bill 10102 you will see
 
02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
that there's quite a few sponsors and
 
02:21:46.429 --> 02:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if that's going to be I
 
02:21:47.450 --> 02:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
don't know what's going to happen to it
 
02:21:50.570 --> 02:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
hasn't been scheduled yet so I would ask
 
02:21:53.450 --> 02:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
you to please look at that as well and
 
02:21:57.469 --> 02:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
see if there's some Equitable solution
 
02:21:57.479 --> 02:21:58.969 align:start position:0%
see if there's some Equitable solution
somewhere

02:21:58.969 --> 02:21:58.979 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
for the people who are hurting that's
 
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
all and thank you very much for your
 
02:22:05.389 --> 02:22:05.399 align:start position:0%

02:22:19.130 --> 02:22:19.140 align:start position:0%

Mr Smith are you on the line
 
02:22:44.090 --> 02:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
he's on the line and unmuted or asked to
 
02:22:44.100 --> 02:22:44.990 align:start position:0%
he's on the line and unmuted or asked to

committee members can you guys hear me
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
we can but I'd first like you to address
 
02:22:54.770 --> 02:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
that that indicate you were from Dover
 
02:22:57.650 --> 02:22:57.660 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and and what is your your
 
02:22:59.750 --> 02:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
interest in this particular Bill sure
 
02:23:01.250 --> 02:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm the Chief Executive Officer of
 
02:23:03.349 --> 02:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
Vision Government Solutions we provide
 
02:23:06.170 --> 02:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
uh revaluation services and camera
 
02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
software which is the assessing software
 
02:23:10.429 --> 02:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
to 57 New Hampshire assessing offices
 
02:23:12.650 --> 02:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
and we are currently the leading
 
02:23:15.770 --> 02:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
projects with Manchester Seabrook Nashua
 
02:23:17.990 --> 02:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
Salem Amherst and Hanover
 
02:23:20.530 --> 02:23:20.540 align:start position:0%
so we're also the largest revaluation
 
02:23:24.290 --> 02:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
vendor in New England so we we feel like
 
02:23:26.510 --> 02:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
we have some important insight into how
 
02:23:28.969 --> 02:23:28.979 align:start position:0%
this change may impact New Hampshire
 
02:23:31.130 --> 02:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
taxpayers cities and towns and and
 
02:23:32.809 --> 02:23:32.819 align:start position:0%
everyone involved
 
02:23:35.330 --> 02:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
okay and and uh could you also bring up
 
02:23:35.340 --> 02:23:37.190 align:start position:0%
okay and and uh could you also bring up
uh

02:23:37.190 --> 02:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:39.790 --> 02:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
uh Mike torello uh representative
 
02:23:43.309 --> 02:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
Maggiore he's from Hudson Mass and uh
 
02:23:46.190 --> 02:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
he's from Vision Government Solutions uh
 
02:23:47.809 --> 02:23:47.819 align:start position:0%
also from out of state and I'd like to
 
02:23:49.490 --> 02:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
understand what his interest in this
 
02:23:51.710 --> 02:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
bill is too awesome all set to go thank
 
02:23:53.870 --> 02:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
you I've asked Mike I've asked Mike to
 
02:23:56.450 --> 02:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
join me Mike works with me at vision and
 
02:23:58.309 --> 02:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
he's been in he's been leading projects
 
02:24:00.889 --> 02:24:00.899 align:start position:0%
for over 30 years and it works with many
 
02:24:02.929 --> 02:24:02.939 align:start position:0%
of the towns in New Hampshire and I just
 
02:24:04.670 --> 02:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
thought he'd provide a good expert voice
 
02:24:06.950 --> 02:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
for additional questions but I'll speak
 
02:24:08.510 --> 02:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
for for our company to my understanding
 
02:24:11.690 --> 02:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
you you have a financial interest uh in
 
02:24:13.849 --> 02:24:13.859 align:start position:0%
completing your obligations that you may
 
02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
have been contracted with by various New
 
02:24:18.050 --> 02:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire towns is is there something
 
02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
beyond that that you'd like to convey to
 
02:24:22.849 --> 02:24:22.859 align:start position:0%
us that uh because we are beyond our our
 
02:24:25.070 --> 02:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh our time schedule here I'd like to
 
02:24:26.450 --> 02:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
conclude this hearing but if you have
 
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
something new that hasn't been testified
 
02:24:31.309 --> 02:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
on already and if you just want to
 
02:24:33.710 --> 02:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
indicate that that you you have a
 
02:24:35.270 --> 02:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
relationship with several towns that
 
02:24:36.889 --> 02:24:36.899 align:start position:0%
you'd like to complete is there anything
 
02:24:38.570 --> 02:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
02:24:40.429 --> 02:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
I think there's a couple of points that
 
02:24:41.990 --> 02:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
haven't been made that would be worth
 
02:24:43.910 --> 02:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
having been heard
 
02:24:45.770 --> 02:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
um that have not anything to do with
 
02:24:47.150 --> 02:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
visions Financial interests but I
 
02:24:48.889 --> 02:24:48.899 align:start position:0%
certainly freely acknowledge that we
 
02:24:50.450 --> 02:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
have a financial interest in in
 
02:24:52.969 --> 02:24:52.979 align:start position:0%
assessing in New Hampshire for sure
 
02:24:55.610 --> 02:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
I understand the time constraints so let
 
02:24:57.110 --> 02:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
me ask you to see if you can wrap it in
 
02:24:58.130 --> 02:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
a couple of minutes
 
02:25:00.050 --> 02:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
yeah of course yep so let me just first
 
02:25:01.610 --> 02:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
make a couple of points to answer some
 
02:25:03.170 --> 02:25:03.180 align:start position:0%
questions that were asked by other folks
 
02:25:05.450 --> 02:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh Massachusetts Rhode Island
 
02:25:07.550 --> 02:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
Connecticut are not doing this
 
02:25:09.050 --> 02:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
um I believe uh one of the
 
02:25:10.670 --> 02:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
representatives asked that question so I
 
02:25:13.130 --> 02:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
can confirm that that is not happening
 
02:25:13.140 --> 02:25:13.969 align:start position:0%
can confirm that that is not happening
um

02:25:13.969 --> 02:25:13.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:16.670 --> 02:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
and um in terms of the key points number
 
02:25:19.309 --> 02:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
one I just wanted to highlight that as I
 
02:25:22.130 --> 02:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
read the bill I did not take away
 
02:25:22.140 --> 02:25:22.910 align:start position:0%
read the bill I did not take away
um

02:25:22.910 --> 02:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:25.070 --> 02:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
what it was designed to do I think it
 
02:25:27.469 --> 02:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
will do things that are unintended
 
02:25:29.210 --> 02:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
um additionally
 
02:25:30.590 --> 02:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
um one of the key points I want to make
 
02:25:33.290 --> 02:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
is when when our customers do updates to
 
02:25:35.270 --> 02:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
their values they do it so that they can
 
02:25:37.389 --> 02:25:37.399 align:start position:0%
stay closer to the 90 to 110
 
02:25:40.250 --> 02:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
Equalization rate that's required as
 
02:25:42.530 --> 02:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
part of their reassessment and for many
 
02:25:43.790 --> 02:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
of those communities that we're working
 
02:25:45.469 --> 02:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
with right now
 
02:25:47.929 --> 02:25:47.939 align:start position:0%
um they're already in the 70s which
 
02:25:49.550 --> 02:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
means that their Equalization rate is in
 
02:25:52.250 --> 02:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
the 70s So currently if they do their
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
update taxpayers will face a 30 to 40
 
02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
percent increase in property taxes
 
02:25:59.690 --> 02:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
already if they push it off another year
 
02:26:01.969 --> 02:26:01.979 align:start position:0%
and they drop into the 60s we could be
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
talking about a 50 increase in property
 
02:26:07.130 --> 02:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
taxes and so that has a very serious
 
02:26:08.990 --> 02:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
negative impact obviously on taxpayers
 
02:26:11.330 --> 02:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
it will increase appeals and it will
 
02:26:13.790 --> 02:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
create an economic shock to taxpayers
 
02:26:15.469 --> 02:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to highlight the fact
 
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
that doing this actually will reduce the
 
02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
the public impact and allow people to
 
02:26:24.770 --> 02:26:24.780 align:start position:0%
better plan and manage their finances
 
02:26:26.630 --> 02:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
second I thought it was important to
 
02:26:29.090 --> 02:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
mention that we're referring to equity
 
02:26:32.030 --> 02:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
here uh where what we have to do is make
 
02:26:33.770 --> 02:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
sure we maintain equity which assessors
 
02:26:36.170 --> 02:26:36.180 align:start position:0%
have worked for decades to create if we
 
02:26:37.730 --> 02:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
pass this bill and we're not allowed to
 
02:26:39.530 --> 02:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
include things like new constructions
 
02:26:42.410 --> 02:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
addition to homes new hotels new
 
02:26:44.270 --> 02:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
factories none of those values will be
 
02:26:46.010 --> 02:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
incorporated and so if we're trying to
 
02:26:48.770 --> 02:26:48.780 align:start position:0%
take care of folks who can't afford to
 
02:26:50.330 --> 02:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
pay their taxes
 
02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
um we're not necessarily helping them
 
02:26:53.330 --> 02:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
we're just giving a free ride to people
 
02:26:55.490 --> 02:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
who just made investments in their
 
02:26:55.500 --> 02:26:56.450 align:start position:0%
who just made investments in their
properties

02:26:56.450 --> 02:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
properties
 
02:26:58.910 --> 02:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
and that's not maintaining equity and
 
02:26:59.990 --> 02:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
then the third thing is I think it's
 
02:27:02.030 --> 02:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
going to create a cost for cities and I
 
02:27:04.670 --> 02:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
think uh uh Jim Rashad made this point
 
02:27:06.170 --> 02:27:06.180 align:start position:0%
earlier but if you've done half of an
 
02:27:07.849 --> 02:27:07.859 align:start position:0%
update and you've paid for half that
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
update and then you stop
 
02:27:11.330 --> 02:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
and you need to redo it next year you're
 
02:27:12.710 --> 02:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
going to have to repay for that half of
 
02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
an update plus what you didn't do so
 
02:27:16.429 --> 02:27:16.439 align:start position:0%
you're going to be paying 2x for the
 
02:27:18.170 --> 02:27:18.180 align:start position:0%
same project and you're going to
 
02:27:19.550 --> 02:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
constrain the industry because you're
 
02:27:22.190 --> 02:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
going to create this entire this glut of
 
02:27:23.690 --> 02:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
projects that have to be done at one
 
02:27:23.700 --> 02:27:24.410 align:start position:0%
projects that have to be done at one
time

02:27:24.410 --> 02:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:27:26.690 --> 02:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
and that's going to raise costs on the
 
02:27:28.969 --> 02:27:28.979 align:start position:0%
towns to do those projects so I think
 
02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
those are all really important
 
02:27:31.370 --> 02:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
considerations and they have nothing to
 
02:27:33.290 --> 02:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
do with visions financial interest they
 
02:27:35.270 --> 02:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
simply will impact the community and I
 
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
do want to say I understand that the
 
02:27:39.050 --> 02:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill have the best
 
02:27:41.450 --> 02:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
intentions and I understand why you know
 
02:27:43.490 --> 02:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
it would seem like a good idea I just
 
02:27:45.050 --> 02:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
think there's unintended consequences
 
02:27:47.090 --> 02:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
for something like this that extend far
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
beyond the reach of the bill and sort of
 
02:27:50.990 --> 02:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
as it's laid out
 
02:27:53.570 --> 02:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
well thank you can I just add one thing
 
02:27:56.889 --> 02:27:56.899 align:start position:0%
this is Mike torello yes go ahead okay
 
02:28:00.830 --> 02:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
just to clarify if the equalization's at
 
02:28:04.670 --> 02:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
75 and then it goes back up to the 95 it
 
02:28:06.290 --> 02:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that that percentage
 
02:28:09.349 --> 02:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
because it goes up 30 or 35 that the tax
 
02:28:12.110 --> 02:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
they're gonna go just for clarity it
 
02:28:14.090 --> 02:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
just means that right now there's
 
02:28:17.030 --> 02:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
inequities some maybe at 75 some
 
02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
properties maybe at 85 some may be at
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
65. it's the median is at 75. by
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
bringing the percentage back up to like
 
02:28:27.410 --> 02:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
say 9 5 100 it brings all the other
 
02:28:30.230 --> 02:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
things that might be at 65 or 85 back up
 
02:28:32.690 --> 02:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
to a hundred that's where you get that
 
02:28:35.270 --> 02:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
one-third go up one third go down and so
 
02:28:38.389 --> 02:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
forth so the percentage isn't that taxes
 
02:28:40.910 --> 02:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
are going to go up 35 or 40 percent is
 
02:28:43.370 --> 02:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
that the percentage of Assessments going
 
02:28:45.910 --> 02:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
to go to an accurate number close to 100
 
02:28:48.469 --> 02:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
for all properties
 
02:28:52.790 --> 02:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
this is vital for consistency and fair
 
02:28:55.250 --> 02:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
taxation for the people and I just want
 
02:28:57.469 --> 02:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
to make that clear thank you for that
 
02:28:59.630 --> 02:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
testimony at this point I'm I'm going to
 
02:29:02.270 --> 02:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on on this bill and
 
02:29:05.270 --> 02:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to move uh I'm gonna pass
 
02:29:07.730 --> 02:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
the virtual gavel to uh
 
02:29:09.590 --> 02:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative piamonte would you like
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
to take a five minute recess uh
 
02:29:13.730 --> 02:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
representative piamonte before you start
 
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay we'll take a five minute recess and
 
02:29:18.889 --> 02:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll start back up with house
 
02:29:21.410 --> 02:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
bill 573.
 
02:29:48.110 --> 02:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:48.120 --> 02:35:25.450 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:35:25.450 --> 02:35:25.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:33.429 --> 02:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:41.950 --> 02:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:43.969 --> 02:35:43.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:35:45.889 --> 02:35:45.899 align:start position:0%
I I think there's a problem I have to
 
02:36:01.550 --> 02:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:04.730 --> 02:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
I did uh mute the room so if folks in
 
02:36:08.330 --> 02:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
the lob could turn on the audio before
 
02:36:19.490 --> 02:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:27.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:36:27.790 --> 02:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:31.849 --> 02:36:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:34.849 --> 02:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
representative CLE can you hear me I can
 
02:36:36.650 --> 02:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
hear you fine yes yeah I think the
 
02:36:38.030 --> 02:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
problem is actually with representative
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
majori's audio
 
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
um he sounds like he's a robot yes he
 
02:36:45.230 --> 02:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
does that's what I was getting so yeah
 
02:36:48.530 --> 02:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
it's uh unfortunately it's you
 
02:36:51.290 --> 02:36:51.300 align:start position:0%
representative maturity I thought you
 
02:36:53.450 --> 02:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
were a robot I thought you were the king
 
02:36:57.170 --> 02:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
you can't be you want a robot
 
02:36:57.180 --> 02:37:47.929 align:start position:0%
you can't be you want a robot
foreign

02:37:47.929 --> 02:37:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:01.309 --> 02:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:08.270 --> 02:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:10.370 --> 02:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative power does it sound wacky
 
02:38:13.550 --> 02:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
there if we're speaking no
 
02:38:16.010 --> 02:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
good yeah we still can't hear the room
 
02:38:17.870 --> 02:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
because the room is still muted you'll
 
02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
have to go to the computer near the TV
 
02:38:28.429 --> 02:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:30.770 --> 02:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
and while they're doing that we will try
 
02:38:33.530 --> 02:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
representative Klee again
 
02:38:35.630 --> 02:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
can you hear me

02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
on the line
 
02:39:31.969 --> 02:39:31.979 align:start position:0%
we do and should be all set to go Mr
 
02:39:31.979 --> 02:39:33.110 align:start position:0%
we do and should be all set to go Mr
chair

02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:34.730 align:start position:0%
chair
okay

02:39:34.730 --> 02:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:39:36.950 --> 02:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
um go ahead you have testimony are you
 
02:39:39.770 --> 02:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
introduced to Bill go ahead
 
02:39:42.170 --> 02:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
 
02:39:43.370 --> 02:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is
 
02:39:46.130 --> 02:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
representative John ginigian I represent
 
02:39:49.790 --> 02:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 8 which is Salem
 
02:39:52.969 --> 02:39:52.979 align:start position:0%
um I want to introduce uh House Bill 573
 
02:39:56.690 --> 02:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
and the main impetus of this uh a couple
 
02:39:59.570 --> 02:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
some of my constituents in Salem who own
 
02:40:02.929 --> 02:40:02.939 align:start position:0%
businesses have come to me and basically
 
02:40:04.910 --> 02:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
um as we know commercial commercials
 
02:40:06.590 --> 02:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
really struggling right now and
 
02:40:09.469 --> 02:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
especially brick and mortar commercial
 
02:40:12.410 --> 02:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
and um so this bill
 
02:40:15.290 --> 02:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
um helped is looking to help the process
 
02:40:17.389 --> 02:40:17.399 align:start position:0%
be a little bit easier for the for these
 
02:40:19.190 --> 02:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
landlords and small businesses that go
 
02:40:21.650 --> 02:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
through tremendous cost uh on a change
 
02:40:23.150 --> 02:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
of views
 
02:40:25.610 --> 02:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
um now we're trying to limit uh how much
 
02:40:27.830 --> 02:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
obviously towns want to be in control of
 
02:40:29.630 --> 02:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
this so we want to limit what we're
 
02:40:32.870 --> 02:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
really doing here but uh large for those
 
02:40:35.570 --> 02:40:35.580 align:start position:0%
who may not know large retail does not
 
02:40:37.849 --> 02:40:37.859 align:start position:0%
mean a huge store it means they're
 
02:40:40.030 --> 02:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
they're selling large items like
 
02:40:44.270 --> 02:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
Furniture cars uh boats you know things
 
02:40:47.030 --> 02:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
that are obviously large items and so
 
02:40:49.429 --> 02:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
we're also not talking about large box
 
02:40:51.770 --> 02:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
stores like Walmart and things like that
 
02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
because we're this bill as you may
 
02:40:56.750 --> 02:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
notice on on item Roman numeral one
 
02:40:59.750 --> 02:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
limits this to fifteen thousand square
 
02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:01.070 align:start position:0%
limits this to fifteen thousand square
foot

02:41:01.070 --> 02:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
foot
 
02:41:03.770 --> 02:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
um establishments and the other thing we
 
02:41:06.889 --> 02:41:06.899 align:start position:0%
do is if something is already zoned
 
02:41:09.469 --> 02:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
um if it's grandfathered commercial we
 
02:41:11.630 --> 02:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
we don't allow that to just have a
 
02:41:12.770 --> 02:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
change of use to another commercial
 
02:41:14.990 --> 02:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
because the fact that it's grandfathered
 
02:41:17.809 --> 02:41:17.819 align:start position:0%
is probably in a different Zone and the
 
02:41:21.710 --> 02:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
town probably needs to look at that
 
02:41:23.990 --> 02:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and basically the the key here is
 
02:41:26.210 --> 02:41:26.220 align:start position:0%
that only and and as you look at the
 
02:41:28.490 --> 02:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
bill you can see exactly what is allowed
 
02:41:31.550 --> 02:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
but um basically the key here is trying
 
02:41:33.170 --> 02:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
to make sure parking doesn't become a
 
02:41:36.349 --> 02:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
problem whatever the new use is must fit
 
02:41:38.570 --> 02:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
within that zone number one and number
 
02:41:42.429 --> 02:41:42.439 align:start position:0%
two parking must not overflow onto
 
02:41:44.690 --> 02:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
adjacent Lots
 
02:41:47.270 --> 02:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know and or it must
 
02:41:49.370 --> 02:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
um be in keeping with existing town or
 
02:41:51.530 --> 02:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
city ordinances
 
02:41:54.590 --> 02:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
so um with that um I'll take any
 
02:41:54.600 --> 02:41:56.389 align:start position:0%
so um with that um I'll take any
questions

02:41:56.389 --> 02:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:41:58.730 --> 02:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
okay representative the jury
 
02:42:02.150 --> 02:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
um we have uh any questions to this uh
 
02:42:06.530 --> 02:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:09.950 --> 02:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:13.070 --> 02:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
I see that Mr chair uh there is one hand
 
02:42:15.230 --> 02:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
raised Mr chair but I do believe it's
 
02:42:17.090 --> 02:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
Sheila Johansen who is here to speak
 
02:42:19.010 --> 02:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
about another bill
 
02:42:20.990 --> 02:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
um and and she has put her hand down so
 
02:42:23.090 --> 02:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
okay that's confirmed thank you I do see
 
02:42:24.950 --> 02:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
now that representative stavis's hand is
 
02:42:30.530 --> 02:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:33.070 --> 02:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:42:35.990 --> 02:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
does this bill anticipate any
 
02:42:38.950 --> 02:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
residential or mixed use
 
02:42:41.870 --> 02:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
changes for the large retail operations
 
02:42:45.050 --> 02:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
that you're addressing
 
02:42:47.150 --> 02:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
no I think we're we're basically trying
 
02:42:50.510 --> 02:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
to focus on Commercial only
 
02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:51.170 align:start position:0%
to focus on Commercial only
um

02:42:51.170 --> 02:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:53.450 --> 02:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
because mixed use you're right is going
 
02:42:55.130 --> 02:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
to is going to bring residential into it
 
02:42:59.210 --> 02:42:59.220 align:start position:0%
and that the intention would not to do
 
02:43:01.130 --> 02:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
that now if that committee feels that's
 
02:43:04.070 --> 02:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
important we can look at it or or that
 
02:43:06.190 --> 02:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is not sufficiently
 
02:43:08.750 --> 02:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
needs more clarification I'm open to
 
02:43:11.630 --> 02:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
that as well follow up Mr chair
 
02:43:16.490 --> 02:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:20.450 --> 02:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:22.610 --> 02:43:22.620 align:start position:0%
if it's in a commercial area
 
02:43:25.190 --> 02:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
really shouldn't be
 
02:43:27.889 --> 02:43:27.899 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be an issue
 
02:43:30.230 --> 02:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying I'm on the planning
 
02:43:33.530 --> 02:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
board in Lebanon I'm trying to Envision
 
02:43:36.950 --> 02:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
this situation here
 
02:43:40.490 --> 02:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
and if there was a a store that wanted
 
02:43:43.309 --> 02:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
to change its use to another store
 
02:43:45.290 --> 02:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
I don't believe the planning board here
 
02:43:47.870 --> 02:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
would get involved
 
02:43:51.230 --> 02:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
there may be some towns that that might
 
02:43:53.809 --> 02:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
yeah that might not be the case
 
02:43:56.750 --> 02:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
um there are many towns where it has to
 
02:43:59.510 --> 02:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
go through planning or zoning and in
 
02:44:01.610 --> 02:44:01.620 align:start position:0%
that case can cause a very expensive
 
02:44:04.370 --> 02:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
transition uh for the new tenant they
 
02:44:05.990 --> 02:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
may have to do traffic studies they may
 
02:44:08.630 --> 02:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
have to do all sorts of things that
 
02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:10.309 align:start position:0%
have to do all sorts of things that
effectively

02:44:10.309 --> 02:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
02:44:13.790 --> 02:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
were most likely done by the previous
 
02:44:13.800 --> 02:44:14.809 align:start position:0%
were most likely done by the previous
um

02:44:14.809 --> 02:44:14.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:18.530 --> 02:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
situation and because the the parking is
 
02:44:20.270 --> 02:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
already allocated for that previous one
 
02:44:23.090 --> 02:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
this bill tries to say let's let's help
 
02:44:24.889 --> 02:44:24.899 align:start position:0%
these small businesses and not have them
 
02:44:28.070 --> 02:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
jump through a whole bunch of Hoops if a
 
02:44:30.050 --> 02:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
town already doesn't require that that's
 
02:44:32.210 --> 02:44:32.220 align:start position:0%
that's fine I think this would be
 
02:44:34.730 --> 02:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
targeting towns who are requiring the
 
02:44:36.770 --> 02:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
extra steps
 
02:44:41.750 --> 02:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:44.050 align:start position:0%
 
chair

02:44:44.050 --> 02:44:44.060 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:44:46.849 --> 02:44:46.859 align:start position:0%
representative question here and that
 
02:44:49.610 --> 02:44:49.620 align:start position:0%
will be sorry representative Tripp you
 
02:44:51.650 --> 02:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
02:44:53.870 --> 02:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:44:56.690 --> 02:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh
 
02:44:59.570 --> 02:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
when I was reviewing this uh
 
02:45:03.050 --> 02:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
Bill last night the uh the thing that
 
02:45:05.809 --> 02:45:05.819 align:start position:0%
struck me right off was uh there's no
 
02:45:07.730 --> 02:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
mention of uh
 
02:45:12.349 --> 02:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
what the what the new use would be and
 
02:45:15.469 --> 02:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
certain zones have uh uh certain
 
02:45:17.210 --> 02:45:17.220 align:start position:0%
permanent uses
 
02:45:20.510 --> 02:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh eliminating the check
 
02:45:24.710 --> 02:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:28.070 --> 02:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
introduce a use
 
02:45:29.990 --> 02:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's not permitted in this particular
 
02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:33.889 align:start position:0%
that's not permitted in this particular
Zone

02:45:33.889 --> 02:45:33.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:33.899 --> 02:45:36.290 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:45:36.290 --> 02:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:45:38.690 --> 02:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
the intention would be if a use is not
 
02:45:41.510 --> 02:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
permitted in that zone then
 
02:45:44.389 --> 02:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
it's still not permitted this is only
 
02:45:47.150 --> 02:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
trying to uses that are already
 
02:45:49.250 --> 02:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
permitted in that zone it's trying to
 
02:45:52.370 --> 02:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
make sure that this this change to you
 
02:45:53.630 --> 02:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
know and you'll see paragraph three
 
02:45:55.790 --> 02:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
change of category of uses from large
 
02:45:59.090 --> 02:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
retail and again large is is large items
 
02:46:00.770 --> 02:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
not because nothing because nothing
 
02:46:03.889 --> 02:46:03.899 align:start position:0%
larger than 15 000 square feet of space
 
02:46:06.170 --> 02:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
is allowed here so change of use from
 
02:46:10.010 --> 02:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
large retail to retail
 
02:46:13.790 --> 02:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
um and so if it's not a lot if if it's
 
02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
not allowed then this wouldn't
 
02:46:19.849 --> 02:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
um you know it wouldn't take so if if
 
02:46:22.490 --> 02:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm open to fine-tuning this if
 
02:46:23.750 --> 02:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's something in there where people
 
02:46:25.610 --> 02:46:25.620 align:start position:0%
feel that it is opening the door to
 
02:46:27.650 --> 02:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
allowing anything that's not allowed in
 
02:46:29.690 --> 02:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
that zone or we could add a sentence I'm
 
02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
open to that because that's not the
 
02:46:34.730 --> 02:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
intent the intent is to only allow
 
02:46:37.309 --> 02:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
what's what's allowed and to make sure
 
02:46:40.270 --> 02:46:40.280 align:start position:0%

thank you for the opportunity to briefly
 
02:48:38.630 --> 02:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
discuss um what um the bill uh from my
 
02:48:40.849 --> 02:48:40.859 align:start position:0%
understanding is and why I support this
 
02:48:43.190 --> 02:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
is um for for
 
02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:43.849 align:start position:0%
is um for for
um

02:48:43.849 --> 02:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
stores that are fifteen thousand square
 
02:48:47.450 --> 02:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
feet or less
 
02:48:50.389 --> 02:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
that are selling retail large retail
 
02:48:53.450 --> 02:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
items and what's great about it is it
 
02:48:56.030 --> 02:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's if you want to do a restaurant or
 
02:48:58.490 --> 02:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
these other uses for this specific bill
 
02:49:02.030 --> 02:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
you still have to go through the same
 
02:49:04.250 --> 02:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
um Prestige or locally depending on the
 
02:49:07.670 --> 02:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
town uh all this is doing is saying I'll
 
02:49:11.090 --> 02:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
give a great example um if if there's a
 
02:49:14.590 --> 02:49:14.600 align:start position:0%
furniture store and they want to sell
 
02:49:17.090 --> 02:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
in some towns for instance Our Town
 
02:49:18.349 --> 02:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
Salem New Hampshire
 
02:49:20.510 --> 02:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a ordinance where
 
02:49:22.670 --> 02:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
you've got to go for a change of use if
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
that furniture store wants to now if it
 
02:49:26.690 --> 02:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
goes out of business and they want to
 
02:49:30.469 --> 02:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
sell uh small items now so it's just the
 
02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
selling of goods or services they would
 
02:49:35.030 --> 02:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
have to go in and get a change of use
 
02:49:37.910 --> 02:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
for what is we refer to in the industry
 
02:49:42.110 --> 02:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
as regular retail so it's actually the
 
02:49:44.990 --> 02:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
size of the item that uh that with this
 
02:49:47.570 --> 02:49:47.580 align:start position:0%
specific Bill pertains to it doesn't
 
02:49:50.990 --> 02:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
allow these 15 000 square feet and under
 
02:49:54.530 --> 02:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
uh businesses to go in and open up a
 
02:49:57.050 --> 02:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
daycare or a movie theater or things
 
02:50:00.230 --> 02:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
like that it's it's just from large
 
02:50:03.830 --> 02:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
retail items to regular retail items and
 
02:50:05.630 --> 02:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
um it gives it gives us a little
 
02:50:07.429 --> 02:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
flexibility in the industry I've been a
 
02:50:10.730 --> 02:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
property manager for 17 years seen a lot
 
02:50:13.010 --> 02:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
of things going in note
 
02:50:14.929 --> 02:50:14.939 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
02:50:17.510 --> 02:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
property owners and managers have a
 
02:50:19.910 --> 02:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
vested interest to not least
 
02:50:23.150 --> 02:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
spaces to uses that are going to cause a
 
02:50:26.150 --> 02:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
problem uh if it if it did they wouldn't
 
02:50:29.450 --> 02:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
get their rents they would be sued by
 
02:50:31.969 --> 02:50:31.979 align:start position:0%
their neighbors if they cause problems
 
02:50:34.550 --> 02:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
so and uh to be honest you the market
 
02:50:38.030 --> 02:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
usually corrects it where a tenant will
 
02:50:40.429 --> 02:50:40.439 align:start position:0%
they have very strict requirements so
 
02:50:42.230 --> 02:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
for instance if you had a fifteen
 
02:50:44.210 --> 02:50:44.220 align:start position:0%
thousand square foot large furniture
 
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
store large retail and uh like let's say
 
02:50:49.309 --> 02:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
a supermarket wanted to come in and
 
02:50:52.790 --> 02:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
there was only 30 spaces in a town like
 
02:50:55.010 --> 02:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
ours they just simply wouldn't lease so
 
02:50:57.710 --> 02:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
the market would basically dictate a lot
 
02:51:00.650 --> 02:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
of this this is just giving a little bit
 
02:51:04.370 --> 02:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
more flexibility and not to question you
 
02:51:06.170 --> 02:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
know what I have a furniture store but
 
02:51:09.110 --> 02:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
now I want to I want to add uh lamps or
 
02:51:12.410 --> 02:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
small little uh wet wipes at the door a
 
02:51:13.910 --> 02:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
little rack of wet wipes the Mind
 
02:51:17.270 --> 02:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
violation of a uh of an ordinance so
 
02:51:19.910 --> 02:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what it is it's it's um
 
02:51:21.889 --> 02:51:21.899 align:start position:0%
it's definitely
 
02:51:24.590 --> 02:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
um retails evolved we got a lot of
 
02:51:27.590 --> 02:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
competition with uh with Amazon and all
 
02:51:30.230 --> 02:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
these guys and you know a lot of uh
 
02:51:33.530 --> 02:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
spaces don't they they don't really um
 
02:51:36.770 --> 02:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
to avoid the uh the red tape left and
 
02:51:38.090 --> 02:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
right they still have to go in for their
 
02:51:40.309 --> 02:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
building permits which is that none of
 
02:51:41.870 --> 02:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
that changes they have to go in they
 
02:51:43.490 --> 02:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
have to meet fire code
 
02:51:45.530 --> 02:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
they need a certificate of occupancy
 
02:51:48.170 --> 02:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
this is just for you know what I it
 
02:51:51.889 --> 02:51:51.899 align:start position:0%
saves me a step to uh to to just do
 
02:51:54.290 --> 02:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
retail large retail to regular retail
 
02:51:56.210 --> 02:51:56.220 align:start position:0%
and I've actually done it myself and
 
02:51:59.150 --> 02:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
it's it it was um believe it or not the
 
02:52:01.550 --> 02:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
sound flooring planning board's great
 
02:52:03.830 --> 02:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
um but you know I I and I'm sure many
 
02:52:06.050 --> 02:52:06.060 align:start position:0%
others are too but this just kind of
 
02:52:08.690 --> 02:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
makes it Statewide to a little push in
 
02:52:11.090 --> 02:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
that direction to give landlords that
 
02:52:13.610 --> 02:52:13.620 align:start position:0%
that flexibility so that the costs
 
02:52:15.889 --> 02:52:15.899 align:start position:0%
aren't uh passed on to small businesses
 
02:52:17.510 --> 02:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
as well sometimes they pay for it
 
02:52:19.429 --> 02:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
sometimes landlords it's based on what
 
02:52:21.349 --> 02:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
they agree upon I just want to thank
 
02:52:23.030 --> 02:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
everyone again for their time and uh
 
02:52:24.710 --> 02:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
much appreciated
 
02:52:27.950 --> 02:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much uh represent uh
 
02:52:29.630 --> 02:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
representative majority I see three
 
02:52:31.309 --> 02:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
hands up including your own would you
 
02:52:33.410 --> 02:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
like to go ahead I'll defer to
 
02:52:35.090 --> 02:52:35.100 align:start position:0%
representative uh Davis and
 
02:52:36.469 --> 02:52:36.479 align:start position:0%
representative Porter because I don't
 
02:52:38.090 --> 02:52:38.100 align:start position:0%
know what the order was
 
02:52:40.550 --> 02:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
very well uh representative Porter had
 
02:52:50.090 --> 02:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:54.170 --> 02:52:54.180 align:start position:0%
who establishes the ordinances that
 
02:52:54.180 --> 02:52:55.790 align:start position:0%
who establishes the ordinances that
prevent

02:52:55.790 --> 02:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
02:52:59.990 --> 02:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
or allow only large retail in a space is
 
02:53:03.290 --> 02:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
that the town or city or is that the
 
02:53:03.300 --> 02:53:06.950 align:start position:0%
that the town or city or is that the
state

02:53:06.950 --> 02:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:11.510 --> 02:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
I guess right right now it's the um it
 
02:53:14.469 --> 02:53:14.479 align:start position:0%
would be the the town itself would be
 
02:53:17.030 --> 02:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
depending on what um they could put it
 
02:53:19.010 --> 02:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
on ballot and the voters can vote for it
 
02:53:21.889 --> 02:53:21.899 align:start position:0%
but this is kind of a little bit of net
 
02:53:24.349 --> 02:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
to over to kind of do a non something
 
02:53:27.530 --> 02:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
non-enabling to the town uh because some
 
02:53:30.889 --> 02:53:30.899 align:start position:0%
towns may have different boards and and
 
02:53:33.950 --> 02:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
um we you know it's uh I think that that
 
02:53:35.870 --> 02:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
is the best I can answer it
 
02:53:38.809 --> 02:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
I have a follow-up Mr chair yes yeah go
 
02:53:43.849 --> 02:53:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:47.389 --> 02:53:47.399 align:start position:0%
it would require all communities to
 
02:53:50.090 --> 02:53:50.100 align:start position:0%
allow this change
 
02:53:53.150 --> 02:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
correct to just enable them to allow
 
02:53:54.950 --> 02:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
this change yeah it would it would
 
02:53:58.309 --> 02:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
require them to to just uh to allow the
 
02:54:00.530 --> 02:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
change of use without going for a change
 
02:54:03.290 --> 02:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
of use from large retail if that they
 
02:54:04.849 --> 02:54:04.859 align:start position:0%
even sometimes may not even have large
 
02:54:07.309 --> 02:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
retail in their ordinance it could just
 
02:54:09.349 --> 02:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
be retail across the board I'm not too
 
02:54:11.750 --> 02:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
sure I never really looked into that but
 
02:54:14.150 --> 02:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm more familiar with locally here
 
02:54:16.730 --> 02:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
in Salem which isn't necessarily a city
 
02:54:18.830 --> 02:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
and it's not really a small rural town
 
02:54:21.590 --> 02:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's a nice medium there and I do know
 
02:54:24.830 --> 02:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
that it's required and you know me and
 
02:54:26.150 --> 02:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
basically almost every commercial
 
02:54:28.429 --> 02:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
landlord would agree
 
02:54:30.290 --> 02:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
um there should be no reason why uh why
 
02:54:32.690 --> 02:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
I don't see any of those anyone in that
 
02:54:35.450 --> 02:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
industry would disagree but um you know
 
02:54:38.090 --> 02:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
and and by the way the parking there's
 
02:54:40.429 --> 02:54:40.439 align:start position:0%
language in this bill that says that you
 
02:54:43.309 --> 02:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
can't overflow and I I assume that they
 
02:54:45.050 --> 02:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
would they would be in a little world of
 
02:54:46.790 --> 02:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
trouble if if you if you went and
 
02:54:49.730 --> 02:54:49.740 align:start position:0%
violated that that that as that's part
 
02:54:51.469 --> 02:54:51.479 align:start position:0%
of the ordinance being proposed or
 
02:54:53.389 --> 02:54:53.399 align:start position:0%
rather the bill
 
02:54:56.269 --> 02:54:56.279 align:start position:0%
but that but that wasn't my question my
 
02:54:58.670 --> 02:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
question is
 
02:55:02.929 --> 02:55:02.939 align:start position:0%
who sets up this ordinance and if why
 
02:55:05.990 --> 02:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
why would the state have to get involved
 
02:55:08.450 --> 02:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
if this is a local ordinance issue I
 
02:55:10.550 --> 02:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
guess that's my question I guess because
 
02:55:12.590 --> 02:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
it's a measure to support small business
 
02:55:14.330 --> 02:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
across the board in the state of New
 
02:55:17.690 --> 02:55:17.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um I the reason that a lot
 
02:55:21.050 --> 02:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
of we felt is very conservative and uh
 
02:55:24.050 --> 02:55:24.060 align:start position:0%
in nature is that it doesn't cost the
 
02:55:26.690 --> 02:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
state of dime so you know there's a lot
 
02:55:27.950 --> 02:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
of things being done for small
 
02:55:29.570 --> 02:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
businesses which are great by the way
 
02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
with the state with with the governor
 
02:55:32.150 --> 02:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
and everything
 
02:55:35.330 --> 02:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
um but you know no loans here no no I
 
02:55:38.030 --> 02:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
mean sometimes uh businesses are
 
02:55:40.309 --> 02:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
rejected good wholesome businesses a lot
 
02:55:42.469 --> 02:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
of people ask why this business is in
 
02:55:45.050 --> 02:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
town or this one isn't in town sometimes
 
02:55:46.670 --> 02:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
because it's a change of use and no one
 
02:55:48.950 --> 02:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
wants to absorb the cost and sometimes
 
02:55:50.750 --> 02:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
that change of use isn't even a high
 
02:55:53.929 --> 02:55:53.939 align:start position:0%
impact this this really doesn't big box
 
02:55:55.730 --> 02:55:55.740 align:start position:0%
guys are still going to have to go in
 
02:55:57.889 --> 02:55:57.899 align:start position:0%
and and do their change of use there's
 
02:56:00.950 --> 02:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
no big box operator that's 15 000 square
 
02:56:03.650 --> 02:56:03.660 align:start position:0%
feet or less we're talking home Depot is
 
02:56:07.370 --> 02:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
120 000 square feet this is like 10 of
 
02:56:09.290 --> 02:56:09.300 align:start position:0%
the floor not even 10 of the floor space
 
02:56:12.349 --> 02:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
so you know so that's kind of it's it's
 
02:56:13.969 --> 02:56:13.979 align:start position:0%
more this is more of a very specific
 
02:56:16.370 --> 02:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
change of use change of uses are still
 
02:56:19.010 --> 02:56:19.020 align:start position:0%
going to have to happen in a hundred
 
02:56:21.410 --> 02:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
other circumstances this is just for
 
02:56:24.410 --> 02:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
large retail Goods to regular retail
 
02:56:24.420 --> 02:56:26.389 align:start position:0%
large retail Goods to regular retail
Goods

02:56:26.389 --> 02:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
Goods
 
02:56:28.670 --> 02:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
um and for this specific uh proposed
 
02:56:31.670 --> 02:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
bill but yes the the towns do decide and
 
02:56:34.010 --> 02:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
this was this is something that would be
 
02:56:36.230 --> 02:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
a a more friendly and create a slightly
 
02:56:38.809 --> 02:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
more uh friendly environment for the
 
02:56:41.389 --> 02:56:41.399 align:start position:0%
state as a whole May attract some some
 
02:56:45.230 --> 02:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh some other businesses or or uh give a
 
02:56:46.730 --> 02:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
little help to the commercial real
 
02:56:50.570 --> 02:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:52.910 --> 02:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
okay Representatives Davis you have a
 
02:56:52.920 --> 02:56:55.650 align:start position:0%
okay Representatives Davis you have a
question

02:56:55.650 --> 02:56:55.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:55.660 --> 02:57:02.210 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:57:02.210 --> 02:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:04.730 --> 02:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
board hat and I'm thinking about
 
02:57:07.370 --> 02:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of Statewide
 
02:57:10.790 --> 02:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
legislation to cities and municipalities
 
02:57:13.550 --> 02:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
that it may not apply to and may cause
 
02:57:16.070 --> 02:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
tremendous confusion because it doesn't
 
02:57:19.730 --> 02:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
apply would you consider you and the
 
02:57:21.769 --> 02:57:21.779 align:start position:0%
other sponsors consider making this
 
02:57:24.650 --> 02:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation so that it's not
 
02:57:26.389 --> 02:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
one size fits all because New Hampshire
 
02:57:33.170 --> 02:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:33.180 --> 02:57:44.769 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:57:44.769 --> 02:57:44.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:47.269 --> 02:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
if it's enabling it really is it would
 
02:57:49.610 --> 02:57:49.620 align:start position:0%
be the same as it is now so right now we
 
02:57:51.290 --> 02:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
would it would it would basically kind
 
02:57:53.690 --> 02:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
of not help out in any way personally I
 
02:57:53.700 --> 02:57:54.830 align:start position:0%
of not help out in any way personally I
do

02:57:54.830 --> 02:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:57:57.590 --> 02:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
um understand the and respect the you
 
02:57:59.450 --> 02:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
know that you're airing on uh and thank
 
02:58:00.769 --> 02:58:00.779 align:start position:0%
you by the way for serving on the
 
02:58:02.630 --> 02:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
planning board as well that's that's
 
02:58:05.269 --> 02:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
quite that's quite the um uh service
 
02:58:08.870 --> 02:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
there um but I think that what you know
 
02:58:11.450 --> 02:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
we're really trying to get help
 
02:58:14.570 --> 02:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
um the you know in making it enabling uh
 
02:58:16.610 --> 02:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
not enabling just kind of opens a little
 
02:58:19.670 --> 02:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
a little more room I'm not too sure too
 
02:58:21.889 --> 02:58:21.899 align:start position:0%
many problems would would happen with
 
02:58:24.469 --> 02:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
this because of the it's retail to
 
02:58:27.170 --> 02:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
retail it's it's large retail but small
 
02:58:30.050 --> 02:58:30.060 align:start position:0%
retail yeah it could be a little busier
 
02:58:32.330 --> 02:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
um sure but once again I had talked
 
02:58:34.250 --> 02:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
about the market that would would
 
02:58:36.349 --> 02:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
correct that I mean I I know these
 
02:58:38.210 --> 02:58:38.220 align:start position:0%
tenants they're getting more strict on
 
02:58:40.429 --> 02:58:40.439 align:start position:0%
what their requirements are and are and
 
02:58:42.830 --> 02:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
I think the covid uh situation I don't
 
02:58:43.849 --> 02:58:43.859 align:start position:0%
know if it's gonna be permanent I don't
 
02:58:45.950 --> 02:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
know the future but I know that it
 
02:58:47.929 --> 02:58:47.939 align:start position:0%
actually made it so less people go in
 
02:58:50.510 --> 02:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
these places as well uh just for social
 
02:58:53.990 --> 02:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
distancing reasons and all that so you
 
02:58:56.750 --> 02:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
know I don't see the big the big uh
 
02:58:58.670 --> 02:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
heavy push so landlord's not going to
 
02:59:01.490 --> 02:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
lease a space that doesn't have not
 
02:59:03.769 --> 02:59:03.779 align:start position:0%
adequate parking because he has the
 
02:59:05.870 --> 02:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
vested interest and nor will a tenant
 
02:59:08.090 --> 02:59:08.100 align:start position:0%
lease that space they they need to at
 
02:59:10.550 --> 02:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
least a space that works for them
 
02:59:12.769 --> 02:59:12.779 align:start position:0%
um and I and I you know I know that the
 
02:59:14.690 --> 02:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
planning boards do a great job but this
 
02:59:16.309 --> 02:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
gives up does put a little more trust in
 
02:59:18.769 --> 02:59:18.779 align:start position:0%
landlords to do the right thing and if
 
02:59:20.750 --> 02:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
they don't you know there's language
 
02:59:23.150 --> 02:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
that says hey you're in trouble here you
 
02:59:24.889 --> 02:59:24.899 align:start position:0%
can't go in that neighboring lot unless
 
02:59:26.389 --> 02:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
there's an agreement with you and that
 
02:59:28.910 --> 02:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
neighbor and and so forth so I I
 
02:59:31.610 --> 02:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question thank you
 
02:59:33.590 --> 02:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman do you have a
 
02:59:36.469 --> 02:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
question for Mr Avis uh representative
 
02:59:36.479 --> 02:59:38.330 align:start position:0%
question for Mr Avis uh representative
Genie

02:59:38.330 --> 02:59:38.340 align:start position:0%
Genie
 
02:59:39.530 --> 02:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
the first
 
02:59:43.070 --> 02:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chair for Mr Abbas
 
02:59:45.349 --> 02:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
unless representative janitian would
 
02:59:48.170 --> 02:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
like to land uh my question is if there
 
02:59:51.469 --> 02:59:51.479 align:start position:0%
if this is a Statewide mandate and
 
02:59:51.479 --> 02:59:52.490 align:start position:0%
if this is a Statewide mandate and
um

02:59:52.490 --> 02:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:55.490 --> 02:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
a business and there's no distinct
 
02:59:59.030 --> 02:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
distinction in a town between large and
 
03:00:01.969 --> 03:00:01.979 align:start position:0%
small retail material
 
03:00:06.889 --> 03:00:06.899 align:start position:0%
what what would happen if a applicant uh
 
03:00:09.650 --> 03:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
does not like the uh decision made by
 
03:00:12.349 --> 03:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
the board for whatever reason
 
03:00:14.630 --> 03:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
um where would the appeal go to since
 
03:00:16.610 --> 03:00:16.620 align:start position:0%
this does this is a state mandate would
 
03:00:19.010 --> 03:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
it go to the local zoning board or would
 
03:00:22.670 --> 03:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:22.680 --> 03:00:28.450 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:00:28.450 --> 03:00:28.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:31.610 --> 03:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
would you like to answer that question
 
03:00:35.450 --> 03:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
well I mean if if uh planning but even
 
03:00:37.730 --> 03:00:37.740 align:start position:0%
if the planning board doesn't um
 
03:00:41.269 --> 03:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh acknowledge this this
 
03:00:41.279 --> 03:00:41.929 align:start position:0%
uh acknowledge this this
um

03:00:41.929 --> 03:00:41.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:44.750 --> 03:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
bill I mean if it was passed they they
 
03:00:46.550 --> 03:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know this would be I'm sure they
 
03:00:49.070 --> 03:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
would be aware of it if there's no
 
03:00:49.080 --> 03:00:50.510 align:start position:0%
would be aware of it if there's no
ordinance

03:00:50.510 --> 03:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
03:00:52.730 --> 03:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
um in the town then it's already just
 
03:00:54.889 --> 03:00:54.899 align:start position:0%
one retail it would just be they
 
03:00:57.469 --> 03:00:57.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even need this but if uh if
 
03:00:59.389 --> 03:00:59.399 align:start position:0%
there there was a town that had that
 
03:01:02.690 --> 03:01:02.700 align:start position:0%
specific language such as Salem which is
 
03:01:04.670 --> 03:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
they have both they have large retail
 
03:01:07.730 --> 03:01:07.740 align:start position:0%
uses and regular retail uses I can't
 
03:01:09.830 --> 03:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
imagine Salem planting boy if this was a
 
03:01:11.150 --> 03:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
they're very I mean they're they're
 
03:01:14.570 --> 03:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
probably very renowned here I think it I
 
03:01:16.730 --> 03:01:16.740 align:start position:0%
think it would be um
 
03:01:18.290 --> 03:01:18.300 align:start position:0%
um you know that would be between the
 
03:01:20.570 --> 03:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
applicant and what they want to do uh
 
03:01:23.150 --> 03:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
where it goes legally I I guess they
 
03:01:24.769 --> 03:01:24.779 align:start position:0%
they can take it where they they want
 
03:01:26.389 --> 03:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
they can take it to the U.S Supreme
 
03:01:28.309 --> 03:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
Court if they want it if it goes up that
 
03:01:31.490 --> 03:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
far but I I that's more of a legal
 
03:01:35.030 --> 03:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
question but I I think um I've answered
 
03:01:37.010 --> 03:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
that to the best of my ability
 
03:01:40.389 --> 03:01:40.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
 
03:01:44.450 --> 03:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
clarification Mr Abbas Adam Abbas who is
 
03:01:46.670 --> 03:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
on the telephone
 
03:01:48.230 --> 03:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
is he a state representative
 
03:01:51.710 --> 03:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
representative or not that seems to be a
 
03:01:53.870 --> 03:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
little confusing no I'm actually just a
 
03:01:56.809 --> 03:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:59.389 --> 03:01:59.399 align:start position:0%
um Mr uh representative majority we have
 
03:02:01.670 --> 03:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative Melvin would like to
 
03:02:02.929 --> 03:02:02.939 align:start position:0%
ask a question
 
03:02:04.490 --> 03:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:02:06.530 --> 03:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question how
 
03:02:08.230 --> 03:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
would this work out in a strip wall
 
03:02:11.510 --> 03:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
where everything is sectioned off
 
03:02:13.550 --> 03:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
because the strip mall could be you know
 
03:02:16.849 --> 03:02:16.859 align:start position:0%
80 000 square feet and it's sectioned
 
03:02:19.309 --> 03:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
down to you know ten thousand square
 
03:02:22.370 --> 03:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
feet yeah so it's only for the the space
 
03:02:25.670 --> 03:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's only for the in the actual space so
 
03:02:29.570 --> 03:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
each unit you know you you can't if it
 
03:02:31.070 --> 03:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
was a supermarket with a hundred
 
03:02:33.349 --> 03:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
thousand square feet and then you had a
 
03:02:35.809 --> 03:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand square footer attached
 
03:02:38.690 --> 03:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
yeah the the 15 000 square feet it's the
 
03:02:40.309 --> 03:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
size of the space it doesn't really
 
03:02:42.110 --> 03:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
matter what's around it
 
03:02:45.110 --> 03:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's the Interior Space
 
03:02:47.090 --> 03:02:47.100 align:start position:0%
not has nothing has not nothing to do
 
03:02:49.490 --> 03:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
with who the co-tenants are if it's a
 
03:02:57.730 --> 03:02:57.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:03.130 --> 03:03:03.140 align:start position:0%
square foot structure and we have uh six
 
03:03:06.349 --> 03:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
different businesses in that structure
 
03:03:10.130 --> 03:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
so any one of them would have to if they
 
03:03:11.870 --> 03:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
change from let's say a furniture store
 
03:03:14.269 --> 03:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
to a clothing store they wouldn't have
 
03:03:16.030 --> 03:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
03:03:18.710 --> 03:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
only if it was under fifteen thousand
 
03:03:20.630 --> 03:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
square feet
 
03:03:23.150 --> 03:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
so if if it was a hundred thousand
 
03:03:25.309 --> 03:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
square feet nothing changes at all the
 
03:03:28.490 --> 03:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
bill is only for specific to 15 000
 
03:03:31.190 --> 03:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
square feet and less so that would be
 
03:03:34.070 --> 03:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of an example
 
03:03:34.080 --> 03:03:34.790 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of an example
um

03:03:34.790 --> 03:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:37.490 --> 03:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
you know like like a small grocer like
 
03:03:39.830 --> 03:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't it would be like uh a
 
03:03:41.630 --> 03:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
regional you know maybe a regional
 
03:03:44.570 --> 03:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
grocery store or something or
 
03:03:46.849 --> 03:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
a sporting goods store maybe a smaller
 
03:03:49.309 --> 03:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
one which the the too many don't exist
 
03:03:49.319 --> 03:03:50.750 align:start position:0%
one which the the too many don't exist
anymore

03:03:50.750 --> 03:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
03:03:52.730 --> 03:03:52.740 align:start position:0%
all right one more follow-up
 
03:03:54.830 --> 03:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
so this would be a building that would
 
03:03:58.010 --> 03:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
technically only be 15 times 15
 
03:03:59.809 --> 03:03:59.819 align:start position:0%
000 square feet
 
03:04:02.389 --> 03:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
not the building the space
 
03:04:05.330 --> 03:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
so it would be the space itself
 
03:04:07.670 --> 03:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
because you gotta you gotta go for and
 
03:04:09.170 --> 03:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
whenever there's a change of use you got
 
03:04:10.610 --> 03:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
to go just for the space you don't go
 
03:04:12.170 --> 03:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
for the whole you go for the whole
 
03:04:13.849 --> 03:04:13.859 align:start position:0%
property but you really you get focused
 
03:04:15.710 --> 03:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
in on that space and what that because
 
03:04:17.809 --> 03:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
the other spaces don't change around it
 
03:04:19.429 --> 03:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
so you don't you only go for a change
 
03:04:24.469 --> 03:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
you use four spaces for individual units
 
03:04:27.230 --> 03:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative majority
 
03:04:29.330 --> 03:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
03:04:31.670 --> 03:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
Abbas for taking my question
 
03:04:34.490 --> 03:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
um hopefully this is a simple one I I
 
03:04:37.190 --> 03:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
would would the with the new business
 
03:04:40.790 --> 03:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
need to still comport with say a sign
 
03:04:40.800 --> 03:04:42.130 align:start position:0%
need to still comport with say a sign
ordinance

03:04:42.130 --> 03:04:42.140 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
03:04:45.590 --> 03:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay thank you
 
03:04:47.750 --> 03:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
and uh one more question representative
 
03:04:47.760 --> 03:04:49.610 align:start position:0%
and uh one more question representative
Staples

03:04:49.610 --> 03:04:49.620 align:start position:0%
Staples
 
03:04:51.170 --> 03:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this is what you get
 
03:04:52.610 --> 03:04:52.620 align:start position:0%
when you have a planning board member on
 
03:04:54.889 --> 03:04:54.899 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:04:56.690 --> 03:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
so I'd love to follow up on
 
03:04:58.370 --> 03:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
representative Melvin's very good
 
03:05:00.710 --> 03:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
question about strip malls
 
03:05:04.429 --> 03:05:04.439 align:start position:0%
in many cases in fact most cases the
 
03:05:07.670 --> 03:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
property on which the spaces
 
03:05:11.570 --> 03:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
abide in a strip mall is owned by a
 
03:05:14.750 --> 03:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
single owner it's not owned by the
 
03:05:17.150 --> 03:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
stores themselves
 
03:05:19.070 --> 03:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
um they lease the space from the owner
 
03:05:21.950 --> 03:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
and frequently that owner is not in New
 
03:05:21.960 --> 03:05:22.790 align:start position:0%
and frequently that owner is not in New
Hampshire

03:05:22.790 --> 03:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:05:25.990 --> 03:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
so how do you envision this bill
 
03:05:28.670 --> 03:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
applying to
 
03:05:32.929 --> 03:05:32.939 align:start position:0%
owners of retail property that com is
 
03:05:37.130 --> 03:05:37.140 align:start position:0%
comprised of many many different stores
 
03:05:39.349 --> 03:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
um how do you how do you see it working
 
03:05:41.870 --> 03:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
and and you made a comment I think
 
03:05:44.389 --> 03:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
before about not a legal matter well but
 
03:05:46.490 --> 03:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
a bill is a legal matter
 
03:05:50.389 --> 03:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
so you know there's a lot in here that
 
03:05:52.550 --> 03:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
would seem to
 
03:05:54.710 --> 03:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
just kind of invite
 
03:05:54.720 --> 03:05:57.170 align:start position:0%
just kind of invite
lawsuits

03:05:57.170 --> 03:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
lawsuits
 
03:05:59.570 --> 03:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
so I and I'm sorry I'm mixing the
 
03:06:02.269 --> 03:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
question up here I'm mostly asking you
 
03:06:03.710 --> 03:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
how you see it
 
03:06:09.050 --> 03:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
applying to large strip mall owners who
 
03:06:13.070 --> 03:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
lease out to multiple spaces
 
03:06:15.769 --> 03:06:15.779 align:start position:0%
well is that I think um that's a great
 
03:06:18.110 --> 03:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
question I think that
 
03:06:21.110 --> 03:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know at the time of Discovery the
 
03:06:23.809 --> 03:06:23.819 align:start position:0%
the landlord will have to do their due
 
03:06:26.570 --> 03:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
diligence and if they they're aware of
 
03:06:26.580 --> 03:06:27.410 align:start position:0%
diligence and if they they're aware of
this

03:06:27.410 --> 03:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:06:29.269 --> 03:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the planning the planning board
 
03:06:31.370 --> 03:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
will be aware of it in the in the states
 
03:06:33.050 --> 03:06:33.060 align:start position:0%
uh in the towns
 
03:06:35.150 --> 03:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
for my you know the planning board in
 
03:06:36.950 --> 03:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
Salem they're aware of everything so if
 
03:06:40.130 --> 03:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
they if a CL uh someone comes in to
 
03:06:42.410 --> 03:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
for to lease a space and there's a
 
03:06:44.210 --> 03:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
question about they will say well this
 
03:06:46.010 --> 03:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
is what's allowed and they will
 
03:06:47.870 --> 03:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
reference this law
 
03:06:50.510 --> 03:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
so so they would you know this would
 
03:06:52.309 --> 03:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
only pertain to a lawsuit if the
 
03:06:55.309 --> 03:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
planning board was not aware of this uh
 
03:06:57.050 --> 03:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
in a certain community and not aware of
 
03:07:00.410 --> 03:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
this uh legislation and they they still
 
03:07:02.929 --> 03:07:02.939 align:start position:0%
uh made a decision it would have to go
 
03:07:04.870 --> 03:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
through several
 
03:07:08.330 --> 03:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
channels I guess to get there uh through
 
03:07:12.050 --> 03:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
error uh are are not not understanding
 
03:07:15.410 --> 03:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
the the law but I think uh if they go in
 
03:07:16.910 --> 03:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
and they do the change of use and they
 
03:07:19.550 --> 03:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
get it done uh you know they well they
 
03:07:20.809 --> 03:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
won't have to get to that level with
 
03:07:22.670 --> 03:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
this so if if it's a fifteen thousand
 
03:07:25.309 --> 03:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
square foot or or under they'll they'll
 
03:07:27.769 --> 03:07:27.779 align:start position:0%
be aware and if they're not aware they
 
03:07:30.110 --> 03:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
should be made aware through due
 
03:07:30.120 --> 03:07:33.290 align:start position:0%
should be made aware through due
diligence

03:07:33.290 --> 03:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:36.830 --> 03:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um I see Mr Avis I want to
 
03:07:38.630 --> 03:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:07:40.670 --> 03:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
um it's my pleasure
 
03:07:42.950 --> 03:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for not recognizing you
 
03:07:45.110 --> 03:07:45.120 align:start position:0%

not lowering my hand and Cordell Johnson

03:08:01.550 --> 03:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
Johnson thank you Mr chairman uh Cordell
 
03:08:02.990 --> 03:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
Johnson representing the New Hampshire
 
03:08:05.510 --> 03:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association in opposition to
 
03:08:07.309 --> 03:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:08:08.990 --> 03:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
um this is
 
03:08:11.389 --> 03:08:11.399 align:start position:0%
um the language of this bill is
 
03:08:12.950 --> 03:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
something that would be perfectly
 
03:08:15.769 --> 03:08:15.779 align:start position:0%
perfectly appropriate to include in a
 
03:08:17.090 --> 03:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance
 
03:08:19.610 --> 03:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
uh but that's that's really where it
 
03:08:22.670 --> 03:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
goes this is a local issue
 
03:08:28.309 --> 03:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
um the the the state statute on uh
 
03:08:31.690 --> 03:08:31.700 align:start position:0%
zoning and planning is extremely General
 
03:08:35.809 --> 03:08:35.819 align:start position:0%
and it it um it authorizes the
 
03:08:37.429 --> 03:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities to adopt zoning
 
03:08:40.849 --> 03:08:40.859 align:start position:0%
ordinances and describes in very general
 
03:08:43.910 --> 03:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
terms what the zoning ordinances may
 
03:08:47.349 --> 03:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
require and then and then it authorizes
 
03:08:50.030 --> 03:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities to have a planning board
 
03:08:52.790 --> 03:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
that performs site plan review when
 
03:08:55.910 --> 03:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
there is a new use or or a change of use
 
03:09:00.230 --> 03:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:03.349 --> 03:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
discussing what kinds of uses can be
 
03:09:05.630 --> 03:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
changed to what other kinds of uses and
 
03:09:09.370 --> 03:09:09.380 align:start position:0%
based on 15 000 square feet or less
 
03:09:13.190 --> 03:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's the level of detail that simply
 
03:09:15.950 --> 03:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong in State Statute that
 
03:09:19.389 --> 03:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
belongs in the local zoning ordinance
 
03:09:23.530 --> 03:09:23.540 align:start position:0%
if if you go down the road of
 
03:09:26.809 --> 03:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
uh of defining
 
03:09:28.490 --> 03:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
um what
 
03:09:30.349 --> 03:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
what kinds of uses can be changed to
 
03:09:31.910 --> 03:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
other kinds of uses under what
 
03:09:31.920 --> 03:09:33.769 align:start position:0%
other kinds of uses under what
circumstances

03:09:33.769 --> 03:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
03:09:36.410 --> 03:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
um you're going to end up with a zoning
 
03:09:38.830 --> 03:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
statute that is hundreds of pages long
 
03:09:41.450 --> 03:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
and every time there's an issue in one
 
03:09:44.210 --> 03:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
municipality uh they're going to come to
 
03:09:46.130 --> 03:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
the legislature and say can you please
 
03:09:48.469 --> 03:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
take care of this this is this is
 
03:09:51.650 --> 03:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
absolutely a local issue
 
03:09:53.510 --> 03:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
um and and one of the problems with
 
03:09:56.030 --> 03:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
doing this at the state level is
 
03:09:59.570 --> 03:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
this bill talks about commercial uses it
 
03:10:01.490 --> 03:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
talks about retail uses it talks about
 
03:10:04.550 --> 03:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
large retail users all of those things
 
03:10:07.849 --> 03:10:07.859 align:start position:0%
are things that are probably defined in
 
03:10:09.650 --> 03:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
the local zoning ordinance
 
03:10:12.349 --> 03:10:12.359 align:start position:0%
and the definitions in Salem's ordinance
 
03:10:14.450 --> 03:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
I can assure you are not going to be the
 
03:10:16.490 --> 03:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
same as the definitions in lebanon's
 
03:10:20.510 --> 03:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
ordinance or uh or exeters or dovers or
 
03:10:21.950 --> 03:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
anywhere else
 
03:10:26.389 --> 03:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
so you're now you're using definitions
 
03:10:28.490 --> 03:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
here that are going to mean different
 
03:10:31.730 --> 03:10:31.740 align:start position:0%
things in different towns
 
03:10:34.370 --> 03:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
um another problem with the build is I
 
03:10:35.929 --> 03:10:35.939 align:start position:0%
think the bill doesn't actually even do
 
03:10:38.510 --> 03:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
what the what the supporters want it to
 
03:10:42.290 --> 03:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
do because they're talking about as I
 
03:10:44.750 --> 03:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
understand that changing from one
 
03:10:46.190 --> 03:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
permitted use
 
03:10:49.309 --> 03:10:49.319 align:start position:0%
in a in a zoning District to another
 
03:10:51.769 --> 03:10:51.779 align:start position:0%
permitted use
 
03:10:51.779 --> 03:10:53.150 align:start position:0%
permitted use
um

03:10:53.150 --> 03:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:55.670 --> 03:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
when you when you change from one use to
 
03:10:58.309 --> 03:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
another that typically requires site
 
03:11:01.790 --> 03:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
plan review by the planning board
 
03:11:05.030 --> 03:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
it it but what this bill says is that
 
03:11:07.490 --> 03:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
that change shall not require a variance
 
03:11:10.309 --> 03:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
or a conditional use permit ordinarily
 
03:11:11.750 --> 03:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't it wouldn't require a
 
03:11:13.790 --> 03:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
variance or a conditional use permit it
 
03:11:16.370 --> 03:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
would require a site plan review
 
03:11:16.380 --> 03:11:16.969 align:start position:0%
would require a site plan review
um

03:11:16.969 --> 03:11:16.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:20.330 --> 03:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
so I don't think this even does what the
 
03:11:23.750 --> 03:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
what the supporters want it to do
 
03:11:23.760 --> 03:11:24.670 align:start position:0%
what the supporters want it to do
um

03:11:24.670 --> 03:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:28.250 --> 03:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
what what really ought to happen here is
 
03:11:31.429 --> 03:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
their uh municipalities already have
 
03:11:36.769 --> 03:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
authority under its RSA 674 43 paragraph
 
03:11:36.779 --> 03:11:38.090 align:start position:0%
authority under its RSA 674 43 paragraph
four

03:11:38.090 --> 03:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
four
 
03:11:41.269 --> 03:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
and says that the municipality can
 
03:11:43.969 --> 03:11:43.979 align:start position:0%
establish thresholds based on the size
 
03:11:46.670 --> 03:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
of a project below which site plan
 
03:11:48.950 --> 03:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
review shall not be required
 
03:11:52.670 --> 03:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
and many municipalities do that so the
 
03:11:56.330 --> 03:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
town of Salem or wherever it is can
 
03:11:59.870 --> 03:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
adopt um as part of their ordinance
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
provision saying that these kinds of
 
03:12:04.190 --> 03:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
projects will not require site plan
 
03:12:07.990 --> 03:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
review but that is it is absolutely
 
03:12:10.550 --> 03:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
a decision that needs to be made at the
 
03:12:12.349 --> 03:12:12.359 align:start position:0%
local level because as I say if a state
 
03:12:14.570 --> 03:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
starts making these decisions you're
 
03:12:17.290 --> 03:12:17.300 align:start position:0%
going to be up to your eyeballs in um
 
03:12:21.650 --> 03:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
requests for for Statewide
 
03:12:24.110 --> 03:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
changes to zoning ordinances
 
03:12:26.090 --> 03:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
I went there but I'd be happy to answer
 
03:12:30.590 --> 03:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
are there any questions to Mr Johnson I
 
03:12:36.889 --> 03:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
see one from representative 311. thank
 
03:12:38.510 --> 03:12:38.520 align:start position:0%

representative piamonti it's not a
question

03:12:41.630 --> 03:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:12:44.030 --> 03:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
um I it's two things I wanted to let you
 
03:12:46.790 --> 03:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
know that my New England lunching

bodyguard has returned home so he's here
 
03:12:52.670 --> 03:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
with me in my open concept house and my
 
03:12:55.490 --> 03:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
second is just a refresh from Mr
 
03:12:58.130 --> 03:12:58.140 align:start position:0%
Johnston regarding what RSA he just
 
03:13:00.830 --> 03:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned a moment ago in regards to
 
03:13:03.950 --> 03:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
changing ordinances in a town
 
03:13:09.230 --> 03:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
yes it was RSA 674 colon 43
 
03:13:12.769 --> 03:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
paragraph four Roman numeral four
 
03:13:16.490 --> 03:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:19.790 --> 03:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
okay um are there any more questions uh
 
03:13:23.690 --> 03:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:26.809 --> 03:13:26.819 align:start position:0%
I see no further questions
 
03:13:29.510 --> 03:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
and I am going to close hearing on five
 
03:13:44.750 --> 03:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:47.990 --> 03:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
so chair I I do believe that the prime
 
03:13:50.870 --> 03:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative genegian is still
 
03:13:54.889 --> 03:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:54.899 --> 03:13:57.290 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:13:57.290 --> 03:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:13:59.630 --> 03:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'll
 
03:14:00.710 --> 03:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
um again for the record I'm
 
03:14:02.750 --> 03:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative John janigian
 
03:14:05.570 --> 03:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
representing Rockingham District 8 which
 
03:14:07.010 --> 03:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
is Salem
 
03:14:09.530 --> 03:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 574
 
03:14:09.540 --> 03:14:10.130 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 574
um

03:14:10.130 --> 03:14:10.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:13.550 --> 03:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
very similar except this one deals with
 
03:14:16.130 --> 03:14:16.140 align:start position:0%
spaces that are 3 500 square feet or
 
03:14:19.370 --> 03:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
less and specifically
 
03:14:22.190 --> 03:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
um small retail and again the word small
 
03:14:25.070 --> 03:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
here it means small item small item
 
03:14:30.010 --> 03:14:30.020 align:start position:0%
retail to small uh item retail and also
 
03:14:32.750 --> 03:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
some service establishments as
 
03:14:37.070 --> 03:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
identified in the bill again I know
 
03:14:38.750 --> 03:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
we're getting tight on time you're
 
03:14:39.950 --> 03:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
running over so I'm not going to go into
 
03:14:43.370 --> 03:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
a lot of detail but uh similar similar
 
03:14:46.030 --> 03:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
concept trying to keep costs down
 
03:14:49.309 --> 03:14:49.319 align:start position:0%
helping business helping small business
 
03:14:51.690 --> 03:14:51.700 align:start position:0%
and and in New Hampshire
 
03:14:51.700 --> 03:14:53.330 align:start position:0%
and and in New Hampshire
[Music]

03:14:53.330 --> 03:14:53.340 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:15:03.889 --> 03:15:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:03.899 --> 03:15:06.309 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:15:06.309 --> 03:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:08.990 --> 03:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have any questions here
 
03:15:11.570 --> 03:15:11.580 align:start position:0%
we have the same people
 
03:15:15.110 --> 03:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
um Mr Abbas and Mr Johnston uh who were
 
03:15:21.650 --> 03:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:21.660 --> 03:15:24.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:15:24.349 --> 03:15:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:32.330 --> 03:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:37.969 --> 03:15:37.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:40.309 --> 03:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
it looks like the whole room is muted
 
03:15:46.309 --> 03:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:54.290 --> 03:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:56.330 --> 03:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
Mr chair it looks like we lost the room
 
03:16:02.510 --> 03:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:04.910 --> 03:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
someone could go up to the computer and
 
03:16:06.170 --> 03:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
turn it on the same way you did after
 
03:16:06.180 --> 03:16:10.550 align:start position:0%
turn it on the same way you did after
lunch

03:16:10.550 --> 03:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:13.130 --> 03:16:13.140 align:start position:0%
wait a minute after lunch I didn't think

03:16:43.130 --> 03:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
okay representative Davis would you like
 
03:16:46.130 --> 03:16:46.140 align:start position:0%

03:16:46.140 --> 03:16:47.269 align:start position:0%
to speak on 574.
yeah

03:16:47.269 --> 03:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:16:50.510 --> 03:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh oh yeah this is uh uh Adam abness I'm
 
03:16:53.510 --> 03:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
not representative mom for the record
 
03:16:55.550 --> 03:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
um uh thank you very much uh once again
 
03:16:58.070 --> 03:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
I I think that this is another great
 
03:17:01.130 --> 03:17:01.140 align:start position:0%
Bill to I won't reiterate a lot of the
 
03:17:03.769 --> 03:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
reasons why but this is something that
 
03:17:06.710 --> 03:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
really really helps the small guy the
 
03:17:09.710 --> 03:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
smaller space is 3 500 square feet or
 
03:17:12.290 --> 03:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
less I manage a property with some that
 
03:17:14.150 --> 03:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
are under that some that are over I have
 
03:17:16.670 --> 03:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
some that are you know up almost 6 000
 
03:17:18.170 --> 03:17:18.180 align:start position:0%
square feet
 
03:17:21.590 --> 03:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
um so I I I know that the 3 500 Footers
 
03:17:23.750 --> 03:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
and under there's there's only so much
 
03:17:26.210 --> 03:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
impact you're gonna have going from
 
03:17:29.030 --> 03:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
retail to the following changes of use
 
03:17:31.849 --> 03:17:31.859 align:start position:0%
now what's interesting about this is in
 
03:17:37.670 --> 03:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
section three of the bill uh B C and F
 
03:17:40.730 --> 03:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
are already allowed in Salem it's just
 
03:17:43.730 --> 03:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
this is just kind of stating the what
 
03:17:45.769 --> 03:17:45.779 align:start position:0%
the what the um
 
03:17:47.269 --> 03:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
um meaning
 
03:17:49.429 --> 03:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
allowed it means that the use that it's
 
03:17:51.290 --> 03:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
going to actually is less of an impact
 
03:17:55.490 --> 03:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
uh parking wise now in place of assembly
 
03:17:56.870 --> 03:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
in restaurants
 
03:17:59.330 --> 03:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
you know it would require more parking
 
03:18:03.230 --> 03:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
demand uh and you know we feel that the
 
03:18:06.349 --> 03:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
you know the the change of use the space
 
03:18:08.389 --> 03:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
is only so big you can only fit so many
 
03:18:10.910 --> 03:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
seats in a 3 500 square foot and that
 
03:18:12.650 --> 03:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
even that's getting less for instance I
 
03:18:16.610 --> 03:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
we have one 60-foot uh restaurant UH 60
 
03:18:19.010 --> 03:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
seat and now they only have 20 because
 
03:18:21.410 --> 03:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic and they're mostly pick
 
03:18:24.530 --> 03:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
up so you know this this just gives a
 
03:18:26.929 --> 03:18:26.939 align:start position:0%
little bit more freedom now I'll I can
 
03:18:29.990 --> 03:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
point out where the existing way of
 
03:18:33.170 --> 03:18:33.180 align:start position:0%
things the market is allowing something
 
03:18:36.230 --> 03:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
interesting to happen in our town now we
 
03:18:39.170 --> 03:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
have up to up to somewhere between 10
 
03:18:41.990 --> 03:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
and 15 vape stores in town which no
 
03:18:43.969 --> 03:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
disrespect to the industry I I have no
 
03:18:47.570 --> 03:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
problem with it but with with that the
 
03:18:48.950 --> 03:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
reason that there's a lot of vape stores
 
03:18:52.190 --> 03:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
in Salem a lot is for two reasons one
 
03:18:54.230 --> 03:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
because the mass you know Massachusetts
 
03:18:56.450 --> 03:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
put some legislation that restricted
 
03:18:58.969 --> 03:18:58.979 align:start position:0%
certain kinds and the other is because a
 
03:19:00.830 --> 03:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
landlord or property manager such as
 
03:19:03.230 --> 03:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
myself right now can lose a retail
 
03:19:05.389 --> 03:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
tenant and put in a vape store because
 
03:19:08.269 --> 03:19:08.279 align:start position:0%
it's also retail so when they when they
 
03:19:10.670 --> 03:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
weigh that against a restaurant
 
03:19:12.889 --> 03:19:12.899 align:start position:0%
let's say a restaurant called us for
 
03:19:16.429 --> 03:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
lease and they only have five seats
 
03:19:19.010 --> 03:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
I I have to go for a change of use
 
03:19:20.929 --> 03:19:20.939 align:start position:0%
just you know it's not going to really
 
03:19:22.429 --> 03:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
be a big deal people are going to pick
 
03:19:25.429 --> 03:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
up some items from a deli you know it's
 
03:19:28.730 --> 03:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
not the the existing zoning
 
03:19:32.510 --> 03:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
does not allow a little more freedom for
 
03:19:35.570 --> 03:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
these smaller spaces to get in we're not
 
03:19:38.090 --> 03:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
talking the Home Depots of the world and
 
03:19:39.849 --> 03:19:39.859 align:start position:0%
the Walmarts of the world we're talking
 
03:19:43.070 --> 03:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
the little the little tiny hair salon
 
03:19:46.670 --> 03:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know the um the retailer that you
 
03:19:50.389 --> 03:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
know the dry goods that wants to put in
 
03:19:53.510 --> 03:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
um a fitness Boutique uh 35 you can't
 
03:19:55.610 --> 03:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
put in Planet Fitness on this one that's
 
03:19:57.590 --> 03:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh that's about what fifteen thousand
 
03:19:59.570 --> 03:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand square feet
 
03:20:03.349 --> 03:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
so this is this is very conservative I
 
03:20:04.790 --> 03:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
feel like the change of uses you're
 
03:20:07.550 --> 03:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
gonna see a a the public will love it I
 
03:20:10.130 --> 03:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
think too because you're going to see a
 
03:20:12.590 --> 03:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
lot more interesting and creative uses
 
03:20:14.630 --> 03:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh things that would be better for the
 
03:20:17.150 --> 03:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
community I I love it I think that this
 
03:20:19.790 --> 03:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
is it gives it gives a little trust once
 
03:20:22.490 --> 03:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
again to the landlord it throws a net
 
03:20:24.650 --> 03:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
over New Hampshire and says look we
 
03:20:26.210 --> 03:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
don't you know we respect your
 
03:20:28.990 --> 03:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
ordinances but this is one specific
 
03:20:32.929 --> 03:20:32.939 align:start position:0%
ordinance for this size space to have a
 
03:20:35.690 --> 03:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
little more freedom and um you know I'm
 
03:20:38.269 --> 03:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
I'm like I'm not getting a lot of calls
 
03:20:41.990 --> 03:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
I'm getting a lot of uh calls to lease a
 
03:20:45.290 --> 03:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
lot of vape stores a lot of uh uses some
 
03:20:47.330 --> 03:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
of them come through here and there and
 
03:20:48.769 --> 03:20:48.779 align:start position:0%
I said you know what this is going to
 
03:20:51.710 --> 03:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
cost a lot of money and uh you know for
 
03:20:53.690 --> 03:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
these smaller tenants Mom and Pops
 
03:20:55.790 --> 03:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
they're not going to pay put the bill
 
03:20:58.969 --> 03:20:58.979 align:start position:0%
maybe and if we do then we have to raise
 
03:21:00.769 --> 03:21:00.779 align:start position:0%
the rent on them and then they they
 
03:21:02.929 --> 03:21:02.939 align:start position:0%
could actually the hopes of them
 
03:21:04.429 --> 03:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
even leasing the speech which I've
 
03:21:05.809 --> 03:21:05.819 align:start position:0%
actually seen and lived through many
 
03:21:05.819 --> 03:21:07.130 align:start position:0%
actually seen and lived through many
times

03:21:07.130 --> 03:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
times
 
03:21:09.710 --> 03:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
um throughout the past 17 years
 
03:21:12.290 --> 03:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
um but anyway uh that's kind of where I
 
03:21:14.929 --> 03:21:14.939 align:start position:0%
stand on it like I say really respect
 
03:21:17.150 --> 03:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
and uh thankful for the opportunity to
 
03:21:19.790 --> 03:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh to speak today
 
03:21:22.550 --> 03:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
a representative of a jury uh
 
03:21:25.910 --> 03:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles has a question
 
03:21:25.920 --> 03:21:27.710 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles has a question
yes

03:21:27.710 --> 03:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:21:31.730 --> 03:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
for anyone who wants to answer it uh
 
03:21:34.929 --> 03:21:34.939 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
03:21:37.190 --> 03:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
parentheses f
 
03:21:41.030 --> 03:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
Dimensions salons including but not
 
03:21:44.929 --> 03:21:44.939 align:start position:0%
limited to beauty hair cosmetic Health
 
03:21:49.190 --> 03:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
waxing and nail salons would that
 
03:21:53.030 --> 03:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:55.730 --> 03:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
um so that's a great question uh tattoo
 
03:21:57.769 --> 03:21:57.779 align:start position:0%
Powers is already allowed because it's
 
03:22:00.650 --> 03:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
retail so if something is already zoned
 
03:22:04.130 --> 03:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
to retail Believe It or Not f is already
 
03:22:07.010 --> 03:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
all that is retail at least in Salem so
 
03:22:09.410 --> 03:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
right now if a sporting goods store
 
03:22:11.510 --> 03:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's thirty three thousand square feet
 
03:22:14.690 --> 03:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
went out of business 3 500 and under and
 
03:22:17.269 --> 03:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
then a salon hair salon wanted to come
 
03:22:18.769 --> 03:22:18.779 align:start position:0%
in they don't have to do a change use
 
03:22:20.929 --> 03:22:20.939 align:start position:0%
but there could be other communities
 
03:22:25.490 --> 03:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
that have an ordinance where you know it
 
03:22:28.490 --> 03:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
throws a net so it's almost moot in some
 
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
areas to some which is no problem and
 
03:22:33.650 --> 03:22:33.660 align:start position:0%
then when it gets to another zone so
 
03:22:36.950 --> 03:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
tattoo is I can like let's say uh I for
 
03:22:39.769 --> 03:22:39.779 align:start position:0%
instance I have a 2000 footer available
 
03:22:41.809 --> 03:22:41.819 align:start position:0%
right now it was a full Mark cell phone
 
03:22:44.389 --> 03:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh retail I could lease to a tattoo
 
03:22:47.510 --> 03:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
place right now without any of this
 
03:22:48.889 --> 03:22:48.899 align:start position:0%
um Oculus to a vape store right now
 
03:22:50.570 --> 03:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
without going through zoning right now
 
03:22:53.230 --> 03:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
but I can't go in least to a restaurant
 
03:22:57.590 --> 03:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:00.650 --> 03:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
so you know I can't go at least to
 
03:23:04.010 --> 03:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
a fitness Boutique that has like a
 
03:23:06.469 --> 03:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
certain class size meaning if they're
 
03:23:08.630 --> 03:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
going to have like 25 people in the
 
03:23:10.429 --> 03:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
class or something you know it's going
 
03:23:13.130 --> 03:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
to be it just it gives a little bit free
 
03:23:15.889 --> 03:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
more freedom to go and and not you know
 
03:23:19.010 --> 03:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
by the way deals fall apart fast uh
 
03:23:20.450 --> 03:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
sometimes the planning board meeting
 
03:23:22.849 --> 03:23:22.859 align:start position:0%
from A to Z could take two to three
 
03:23:25.849 --> 03:23:25.859 align:start position:0%
months multiple meetings sometimes
 
03:23:28.070 --> 03:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
someone's looking for a space and they
 
03:23:29.570 --> 03:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
just want to get in and they want to get
 
03:23:32.290 --> 03:23:32.300 align:start position:0%
in easy or a little easier
 
03:23:35.389 --> 03:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
I'll be honest with you in a world of
 
03:23:37.969 --> 03:23:37.979 align:start position:0%
restrictions for business at this time
 
03:23:39.469 --> 03:23:39.479 align:start position:0%
and small business doesn't need any more
 
03:23:40.729 --> 03:23:40.739 align:start position:0%
restrictions we need we need a little
 
03:23:40.739 --> 03:23:41.530 align:start position:0%
restrictions we need we need a little
help

03:23:41.530 --> 03:23:41.540 align:start position:0%
help
 
03:23:45.170 --> 03:23:45.180 align:start position:0%
especially online is just it's coming in
 
03:23:46.910 --> 03:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
big and you're going to see the the
 
03:23:49.130 --> 03:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
online percentage get higher and higher
 
03:23:51.830 --> 03:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
as the years go on so brick and mortar
 
03:23:53.929 --> 03:23:53.939 align:start position:0%
needs it we need more traffic we need a
 
03:23:55.269 --> 03:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
little bit more traffic definitely
 
03:23:57.889 --> 03:23:57.899 align:start position:0%
across the board in the whole state and
 
03:23:59.929 --> 03:23:59.939 align:start position:0%
and uh the New Hampshire is a great
 
03:24:01.250 --> 03:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
state that's why everyone comes over
 
03:24:03.170 --> 03:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
over the line I love the state here I
 
03:24:05.450 --> 03:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
love it here but um once again thank you
 
03:24:07.610 --> 03:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity
 
03:24:10.309 --> 03:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Abbas thank you very much for
 
03:24:12.410 --> 03:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
testifying I want to recognize
 
03:24:18.710 --> 03:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:20.870 --> 03:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:24:23.030 --> 03:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
Heimer I am representative Daryl Abbas
 
03:24:24.349 --> 03:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
and I represent Rockingham County
 
03:24:26.450 --> 03:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
District 8. I'm speaking support of
 
03:24:28.969 --> 03:24:28.979 align:start position:0%
House Bill 574
 
03:24:31.490 --> 03:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sure this committee is aware that a
 
03:24:34.269 --> 03:24:34.279 align:start position:0%
landlord is is running a business and
 
03:24:37.010 --> 03:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
the pandemic has been very difficult on
 
03:24:39.170 --> 03:24:39.180 align:start position:0%
all businesses uh retail businesses
 
03:24:41.150 --> 03:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
small businesses as well as the
 
03:24:41.160 --> 03:24:42.590 align:start position:0%
small businesses as well as the
landlords

03:24:42.590 --> 03:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
landlords
 
03:24:44.389 --> 03:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
as small businesses go out of business
 
03:24:46.790 --> 03:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
the landlord has now lost their customer
 
03:24:49.309 --> 03:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
and to get a change of use in an example
 
03:24:51.710 --> 03:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
would be an electronic shop
 
03:24:53.570 --> 03:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
if if you want to average want to
 
03:24:56.330 --> 03:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
convert that to let's say a coffee shop
 
03:24:58.429 --> 03:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
in order to get the change of use some
 
03:25:01.670 --> 03:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
some towns it's very expensive to just
 
03:25:03.769 --> 03:25:03.779 align:start position:0%
get the change you use uh some some
 
03:25:05.650 --> 03:25:05.660 align:start position:0%
planning boards that uh have the
 
03:25:08.690 --> 03:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
discretion to desire for their
 
03:25:11.990 --> 03:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
consideration a traffic plan uh an
 
03:25:13.910 --> 03:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
updated site plan
 
03:25:16.070 --> 03:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
some to get changes abuse can cost
 
03:25:17.929 --> 03:25:17.939 align:start position:0%
upwards of ten fifteen thousand dollars
 
03:25:18.889 --> 03:25:18.899 align:start position:0%
even more
 
03:25:21.469 --> 03:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
so for a startup business trying to open
 
03:25:23.150 --> 03:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
a new business
 
03:25:26.090 --> 03:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
they start across are high as is I feel
 
03:25:29.090 --> 03:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
that the change of use for a small uh
 
03:25:31.729 --> 03:25:31.739 align:start position:0%
retail business that's under 3500 square
 
03:25:35.210 --> 03:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
feet to convert from a small electronic
 
03:25:37.570 --> 03:25:37.580 align:start position:0%
store let's say to a small coffee shop
 
03:25:39.889 --> 03:25:39.899 align:start position:0%
would have to go through Great Lengths
 
03:25:42.290 --> 03:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
in order to do to get that established
 
03:25:44.450 --> 03:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
but also adding the cost simply to get
 
03:25:45.889 --> 03:25:45.899 align:start position:0%
the change of use
 
03:25:49.309 --> 03:25:49.319 align:start position:0%
when the impact is going to be minimal I
 
03:25:50.929 --> 03:25:50.939 align:start position:0%
believe would really help
 
03:25:52.910 --> 03:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
boost our economy on all ends it would
 
03:25:54.469 --> 03:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
help the landlords out it would help
 
03:25:56.630 --> 03:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
keep those businesses going it would
 
03:25:58.429 --> 03:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
help small businesses and a lot of
 
03:26:00.050 --> 03:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
tenants in those buildings
 
03:26:02.210 --> 03:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
especially strip malls they benefit from
 
03:26:04.309 --> 03:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
having other tenants open in the same
 
03:26:05.870 --> 03:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
Shopping Center
 
03:26:07.429 --> 03:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
so if you have a strip mall where
 
03:26:09.950 --> 03:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh people who shop at one
 
03:26:11.210 --> 03:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
store they'll go to multiple stores
 
03:26:13.130 --> 03:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
while they're there so it's really in
 
03:26:14.389 --> 03:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
the interest of all of the businesses
 
03:26:16.070 --> 03:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
that not ever have a vacancy and they're
 
03:26:17.510 --> 03:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
strip mall so that's
 
03:26:19.910 --> 03:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's really it's a win-win-win I
 
03:26:21.229 --> 03:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
would say it's winning for the existing
 
03:26:23.809 --> 03:26:23.819 align:start position:0%
businesses that manage to survive during
 
03:26:25.610 --> 03:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
the pandemic it's a win for the landlord
 
03:26:27.110 --> 03:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
but it's also win for the startup costs
 
03:26:28.550 --> 03:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
and I believe the impact
 
03:26:32.389 --> 03:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
would be rather minimal so I would uh to
 
03:26:36.110 --> 03:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
speak in support of HB uh 574 I want to
 
03:26:37.429 --> 03:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
thank the committee and thank you Mr
 
03:26:43.429 --> 03:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:43.439 --> 03:26:53.889 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:26:53.889 --> 03:26:53.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:57.349 --> 03:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
I have lost my computer here so I cannot
 
03:26:59.090 --> 03:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
see and tell me if there are any other
 
03:27:01.070 --> 03:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
people who like to testify
 
03:27:04.490 --> 03:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
sure Mr chair I do not see anyone else
 
03:27:07.729 --> 03:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
with their hand up and double checking
 
03:27:09.530 --> 03:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
against the list the only other person
 
03:27:13.070 --> 03:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
is uh to speak is Cordell Johnson who
 
03:27:16.490 --> 03:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
just put his hand up very good uh
 
03:27:18.110 --> 03:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
Cordell Johnson
 
03:27:23.809 --> 03:27:23.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:26.570 --> 03:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman again Cordell
 
03:27:28.130 --> 03:27:28.140 align:start position:0%
Johnston from the New Hampshire
 
03:27:31.130 --> 03:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and uh we oppose
 
03:27:32.570 --> 03:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
this bill for the same reason we did
 
03:27:36.710 --> 03:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill 573 again this would be
 
03:27:39.110 --> 03:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely appropriate and and probably
 
03:27:41.389 --> 03:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
even a good idea to put into a local
 
03:27:45.229 --> 03:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance and uh if the if the
 
03:27:47.450 --> 03:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
people of Salem want to or any town want
 
03:27:49.130 --> 03:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
to put that into their local zoning
 
03:27:51.050 --> 03:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
ordinance uh that's fine and I think
 
03:27:53.450 --> 03:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
they should be encouraged to do so
 
03:27:55.490 --> 03:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
but again
 
03:27:55.500 --> 03:27:57.769 align:start position:0%
but again
um

03:27:57.769 --> 03:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:01.010 --> 03:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
putting this kind of detail about what
 
03:28:03.110 --> 03:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
is and is not permitted and how it how
 
03:28:05.690 --> 03:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
it should be done in a state statute is
 
03:28:08.630 --> 03:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
going to cause a lot of problems for
 
03:28:13.010 --> 03:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
municipalities again it uses Define uses
 
03:28:15.849 --> 03:28:15.859 align:start position:0%
terms such as retail
 
03:28:19.010 --> 03:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
there's one one term in here it's it's
 
03:28:21.830 --> 03:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
quote retail stores store groups shops
 
03:28:24.950 --> 03:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
or service establishments close quote
 
03:28:26.929 --> 03:28:26.939 align:start position:0%
um that may be something that's defined
 
03:28:28.849 --> 03:28:28.859 align:start position:0%
in one zoning ordinance but certainly
 
03:28:30.590 --> 03:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
you're not going to have the same
 
03:28:32.870 --> 03:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
definition in another zoning ordinance
 
03:28:35.389 --> 03:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
so it really really should be left to
 
03:28:37.429 --> 03:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
the municipality
 
03:28:42.050 --> 03:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
and again uh site RSA 674 43
 
03:28:46.429 --> 03:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
paragraph four that allows the town to
 
03:28:48.590 --> 03:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
um to exempt
 
03:28:48.600 --> 03:28:51.410 align:start position:0%
um to exempt
uh

03:28:51.410 --> 03:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:54.110 --> 03:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
developments or changes of use based on
 
03:28:56.150 --> 03:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
based on size and this would seem to
 
03:29:01.370 --> 03:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
fall perfectly into that to adopt uh to
 
03:29:04.250 --> 03:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
adopt an exemption for these kinds of
 
03:29:07.910 --> 03:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
changes involving spaces of 3 500 square
 
03:29:10.849 --> 03:29:10.859 align:start position:0%
feet that's that's where the the
 
03:29:12.950 --> 03:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
legislating should be done at the local
 
03:29:15.710 --> 03:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
level not uh not at the state level
 
03:29:18.590 --> 03:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:20.990 --> 03:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you Miss Johnson uh are there
 
03:29:22.550 --> 03:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
any more uh people that would like to
 
03:29:25.309 --> 03:29:25.319 align:start position:0%
testify Mr George
 
03:29:29.210 --> 03:29:29.220 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I do not see anybody else uh
 
03:29:30.889 --> 03:29:30.899 align:start position:0%

this bill have approached the town of

Salem zoning board or planning board and
 
03:30:15.170 --> 03:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
asked that they consider
 
03:30:19.550 --> 03:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:22.370 --> 03:30:22.380 align:start position:0%

benefit Salem but to benefit the whole
 
03:30:33.769 --> 03:30:33.779 align:start position:0%

um sales

03:30:34.929 --> 03:30:34.939 align:start position:0%
um sales
 
03:30:37.849 --> 03:30:37.859 align:start position:0%
Amazon's you know and all that is is
 
03:30:39.290 --> 03:30:39.300 align:start position:0%
hurting a lot of the brick and mortar
 
03:30:41.330 --> 03:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
stores so we're looking this is more of
 
03:30:43.610 --> 03:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
a pro-business pro small business build
 
03:30:45.290 --> 03:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
for the whole state
 
03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
it would benefit Salem as well but we're
 
03:30:49.610 --> 03:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
not looking to if we're looking just for
 
03:30:52.550 --> 03:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
sale and we I agree with um Cordell
 
03:30:54.410 --> 03:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
Johnson that we should change the
 
03:30:56.929 --> 03:30:56.939 align:start position:0%
ordinance but we we want to build up
 
03:30:56.939 --> 03:30:57.950 align:start position:0%
ordinance but we we want to build up
business

03:30:57.950 --> 03:30:57.960 align:start position:0%

um and encourage small business in the
 
03:31:06.710 --> 03:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:06.720 --> 03:31:07.849 align:start position:0%
 
back

03:31:07.849 --> 03:31:07.859 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:31:07.859 --> 03:31:09.170 align:start position:0%
back
um

03:31:09.170 --> 03:31:09.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:11.630 --> 03:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
representative commanduri are there
 
03:31:14.210 --> 03:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
anyone else with their hands up
 
03:31:16.610 --> 03:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
no Mr chair I see no one else with their
 
03:31:19.309 --> 03:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
hands up okay I see no more questions at
 
03:31:20.750 --> 03:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
this time I'm going to end the hearing
 
03:31:26.090 --> 03:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
on House Bill uh 574 and open up the
 
03:31:28.849 --> 03:31:28.859 align:start position:0%
hearing on House built
 
03:31:31.490 --> 03:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
six one six
 
03:31:36.110 --> 03:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:38.150 --> 03:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
I've pardon me I just lost the
 
03:31:40.070 --> 03:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
connection here and I'm
 
03:31:43.130 --> 03:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
trying to get back on the uh
 
03:31:46.250 --> 03:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
the board here representative birdie is
 
03:31:52.729 --> 03:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:54.769 --> 03:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
one moment Mr chair I'll double check I
 
03:31:55.969 --> 03:31:55.979 align:start position:0%
was just
 
03:31:59.450 --> 03:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
getting organized but I don't think I
 
03:31:59.460 --> 03:32:01.510 align:start position:0%
getting organized but I don't think I
see

03:32:01.510 --> 03:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:32:06.830 --> 03:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:08.510 --> 03:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
hold on a second let me double check
 
03:32:11.150 --> 03:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
just to see if possibly through our
 
03:32:13.070 --> 03:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
panelists but no I don't see either
 
03:32:18.349 --> 03:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
through panelists or attendees and as we
 
03:32:20.330 --> 03:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
have done before I'd be more than happy
 
03:32:22.849 --> 03:32:22.859 align:start position:0%
with your permission Mr chair
 
03:32:26.690 --> 03:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
to introduce the bill
 
03:32:29.090 --> 03:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
if you would like very good why don't
 
03:32:30.590 --> 03:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
you do that
 
03:32:32.389 --> 03:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you members
 
03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
of the House Municipal and County
 
03:32:36.469 --> 03:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
government committee my name for the
 
03:32:38.269 --> 03:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
record is representative Jim Maggiore
 
03:32:39.950 --> 03:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
representing the town of Northampton
 
03:32:43.250 --> 03:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 22 and I'm here to
 
03:32:46.030 --> 03:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill
 
03:32:49.250 --> 03:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
616fn and act relative to review of
 
03:32:50.769 --> 03:32:50.779 align:start position:0%
planning board
 
03:32:54.590 --> 03:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
decisions with that said Mr chair I do
 
03:32:56.510 --> 03:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
notice that there are two people who
 
03:32:58.610 --> 03:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
have called in
 
03:33:01.490 --> 03:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
um I don't see on the list to testify
 
03:33:03.769 --> 03:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
remotely anyone other than Cordell
 
03:33:05.870 --> 03:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
Johnson so I I don't know if you'd like
 
03:33:08.330 --> 03:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
me to allow both of those people who are
 
03:33:10.309 --> 03:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
calling in to see if one of them might
 
03:33:12.830 --> 03:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
happen to be representative baruti
 
03:33:15.590 --> 03:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh yes and why do we do that and I have
 
03:33:17.809 --> 03:33:17.819 align:start position:0%
have that each one identified themselves
 
03:33:19.729 --> 03:33:19.739 align:start position:0%
recently okay so the first one I've
 
03:33:22.370 --> 03:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
clicked on is the number ending in six
 
03:33:24.410 --> 03:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
six eight nine
 
03:33:27.590 --> 03:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
and um I've asked that person to unmute
 
03:33:30.050 --> 03:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
and of course uh for those who might
 
03:33:40.010 --> 03:33:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:42.849 --> 03:33:42.859 align:start position:0%
they don't like me okay
 
03:33:46.670 --> 03:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
how could the next one then which is uh
 
03:33:51.290 --> 03:33:51.300 align:start position:0%
area code 978 and ending in four three
 
03:33:55.070 --> 03:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
zero zero and again
 
03:33:58.729 --> 03:33:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:01.190 --> 03:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
oh yep should be good and I'm just
 
03:34:02.389 --> 03:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
curious if this happens to be
 
03:34:04.790 --> 03:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative burruti
 
03:34:07.790 --> 03:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
hi no it's not um I'm Jackie Walker
 
03:34:09.710 --> 03:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak for the next bill
 
03:34:13.969 --> 03:34:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:16.729 --> 03:34:16.739 align:start position:0%
okay well that uh apparently Cordell
 
03:34:21.469 --> 03:34:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:23.690 --> 03:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Cordell Johnson
 
03:34:25.610 --> 03:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire Municipal
 
03:34:25.620 --> 03:34:27.290 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire Municipal
Association

03:34:27.290 --> 03:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
Association
 
03:34:30.650 --> 03:34:30.660 align:start position:0%
um and I hate to seem like a difficult
 
03:34:33.349 --> 03:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
person but again in uh opposing this
 
03:34:33.359 --> 03:34:35.450 align:start position:0%
person but again in uh opposing this
bill

03:34:35.450 --> 03:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:34:39.290 --> 03:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
um largely because it is very well I
 
03:34:40.490 --> 03:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
guess there are a couple reasons one is
 
03:34:44.269 --> 03:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
it's very confusing the other is that it
 
03:34:47.389 --> 03:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
it seems pretty unfair I guess I'll talk
 
03:34:50.269 --> 03:34:50.279 align:start position:0%
about the unfairness part first
 
03:34:53.090 --> 03:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
um this would require as I as I read it
 
03:34:57.290 --> 03:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
if someone if someone appeals uh
 
03:35:00.050 --> 03:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
typically a planning board's approval of
 
03:35:02.210 --> 03:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
a site plan
 
03:35:05.929 --> 03:35:05.939 align:start position:0%
um or either residential or commercial
 
03:35:08.809 --> 03:35:08.819 align:start position:0%
um it's property the person filing the
 
03:35:10.990 --> 03:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
appeal would have to
 
03:35:13.849 --> 03:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
pay a filing fee of Seventeen hundred
 
03:35:17.210 --> 03:35:17.220 align:start position:0%
dollars which is uh really quite High
 
03:35:19.429 --> 03:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
compared to ordinary Court filing for
 
03:35:22.070 --> 03:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
the city would have to
 
03:35:24.349 --> 03:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
file a bond equal to the assessed value
 
03:35:26.510 --> 03:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
of the property
 
03:35:28.610 --> 03:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
um and if the appealing party loses
 
03:35:30.590 --> 03:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
would have to pay the other party's
 
03:35:35.990 --> 03:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
attorney fees that is that's pretty
 
03:35:39.950 --> 03:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
um heavily skewed against someone who's
 
03:35:43.309 --> 03:35:43.319 align:start position:0%
just exercising his or her uh legal
 
03:35:45.110 --> 03:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
rights to appeal a decision of a
 
03:35:47.870 --> 03:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:50.570 --> 03:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
um or or a decision of a zoning Board of
 
03:35:53.210 --> 03:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
adjustment as the case may be and I
 
03:35:53.220 --> 03:35:53.990 align:start position:0%
adjustment as the case may be and I
guess

03:35:53.990 --> 03:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
guess
 
03:35:56.410 --> 03:35:56.420 align:start position:0%
for the most part the the unfairness
 
03:35:58.729 --> 03:35:58.739 align:start position:0%
doesn't really affect
 
03:36:00.590 --> 03:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
local governments which is who we
 
03:36:02.210 --> 03:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
represent so
 
03:36:02.220 --> 03:36:03.530 align:start position:0%
represent so
so

03:36:03.530 --> 03:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:36:06.349 --> 03:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily affect us except
 
03:36:09.530 --> 03:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
that there are cases not a lot but there
 
03:36:12.410 --> 03:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
are cases in which a municipality could
 
03:36:14.330 --> 03:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
be appealing a decision of its own
 
03:36:16.790 --> 03:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
Zoning Board of adjustment
 
03:36:19.670 --> 03:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
um and so it would under this
 
03:36:22.849 --> 03:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
have a significant cost impact on the on
 
03:36:25.250 --> 03:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
the municipality filing that appeal
 
03:36:28.010 --> 03:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
so that's the unfairness part of it the
 
03:36:30.650 --> 03:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
confused the confusion part of it
 
03:36:33.290 --> 03:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
is it talks about the cost to file an
 
03:36:35.990 --> 03:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
appeal pursuant to this section
 
03:36:38.870 --> 03:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh however an appeal
 
03:36:41.450 --> 03:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be this doesn't create a new
 
03:36:42.889 --> 03:36:42.899 align:start position:0%
right of appeal
 
03:36:46.790 --> 03:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
and uh so an appeal would be filed under
 
03:36:51.170 --> 03:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
existing law which for a or a appeal of
 
03:36:54.290 --> 03:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
a zba decision would be it would be
 
03:36:57.229 --> 03:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
Cloud under RSA 677-4
 
03:36:59.150 --> 03:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
an appeal or the planning board decision
 
03:37:02.450 --> 03:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
would be filed under 677.15
 
03:37:02.460 --> 03:37:03.650 align:start position:0%
would be filed under 677.15
so

03:37:03.650 --> 03:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:06.229 --> 03:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
there are existing sections that provide
 
03:37:09.110 --> 03:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
the right of appeal and this is sort of
 
03:37:13.429 --> 03:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
coming in from the side and seeming to
 
03:37:16.429 --> 03:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
create a different basis for appeal
 
03:37:19.130 --> 03:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
and that's going to lead to a lot of
 
03:37:22.070 --> 03:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
confusion for parties to these to these
 
03:37:24.050 --> 03:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
land use cases
 
03:37:24.060 --> 03:37:24.769 align:start position:0%
land use cases
um

03:37:24.769 --> 03:37:24.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:27.950 --> 03:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
and then it uh in paragraph five it says
 
03:37:29.809 --> 03:37:29.819 align:start position:0%
standing for appeals of projects
 
03:37:31.790 --> 03:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
pursuant to paragraph one shall be
 
03:37:34.729 --> 03:37:34.739 align:start position:0%
limited to direct Butters only
 
03:37:38.090 --> 03:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
again under the existing law there's a
 
03:37:40.370 --> 03:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
right to appeal it's not limited to
 
03:37:43.550 --> 03:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
direct to Butters it's it it applies to
 
03:37:47.150 --> 03:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
any aggrieved party and a grieved party
 
03:37:49.190 --> 03:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
is something that has been defined by
 
03:37:51.469 --> 03:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
Court decisions and it includes more
 
03:37:53.210 --> 03:37:53.220 align:start position:0%
than just director Butters it includes
 
03:37:56.510 --> 03:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
anyone who who whose rights or interest
 
03:38:01.790 --> 03:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh are directly affected by the decision
 
03:38:03.769 --> 03:38:03.779 align:start position:0%
so when someone wants to wear Pete wants
 
03:38:05.990 --> 03:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
to appeal a decision if this bill passes
 
03:38:07.849 --> 03:38:07.859 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of confusion
 
03:38:10.670 --> 03:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
about exactly what law applies what is
 
03:38:13.250 --> 03:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
the filing fee uh what are the results
 
03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
do I have to file a bond and who has
 
03:38:18.170 --> 03:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
standing to appeal
 
03:38:21.170 --> 03:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
um so uh for those reasons we oppose the
 
03:38:23.090 --> 03:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
bill and I'd be happy to try to answer
 
03:38:25.070 --> 03:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:38:27.830 --> 03:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative majority other
 
03:38:29.389 --> 03:38:29.399 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
03:38:34.790 --> 03:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:37.370 --> 03:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
used myself there I see one hand up from
 
03:38:41.750 --> 03:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:44.150 --> 03:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
all right uh Mr Abbott do you have a
 
03:38:44.160 --> 03:38:46.190 align:start position:0%
all right uh Mr Abbott do you have a
question

03:38:46.190 --> 03:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:38:48.290 --> 03:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
sure it actually isn't a question I
 
03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
would like to testify if that's okay
 
03:38:50.160 --> 03:38:52.010 align:start position:0%
would like to testify if that's okay
chairman

03:38:52.010 --> 03:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:38:54.410 --> 03:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
um I signed up late and you're not able
 
03:38:57.349 --> 03:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
through the system to uh I would say
 
03:38:59.929 --> 03:38:59.939 align:start position:0%
that first of all I'm Gary Abbott I'm
 
03:39:01.790 --> 03:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
the Executive Vice President of the
 
03:39:04.190 --> 03:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors
 
03:39:07.250 --> 03:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
our legislative committee reviewed this
 
03:39:09.170 --> 03:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
bill as an association we represent
 
03:39:12.410 --> 03:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
large commercial contractors I was
 
03:39:14.990 --> 03:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
hoping to hear the sponsor's reason for
 
03:39:17.030 --> 03:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
the bill in which we didn't really hear
 
03:39:19.670 --> 03:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
the sponsors reasons for the bill I had
 
03:39:22.190 --> 03:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
two construction attorneys look at this
 
03:39:24.050 --> 03:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
and we're in kind of an agreement with
 
03:39:27.710 --> 03:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
Cordell Johnson who just spoke we think
 
03:39:29.229 --> 03:39:29.239 align:start position:0%
it's confusing
 
03:39:32.510 --> 03:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
the bond equal to the assessed value on
 
03:39:36.070 --> 03:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
a commercial project could be awful High
 
03:39:38.809 --> 03:39:38.819 align:start position:0%
it just seems to put in a higher level
 
03:39:42.290 --> 03:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
now at the same time you can have a
 
03:39:44.870 --> 03:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
construction appeals as well so this was
 
03:39:44.880 --> 03:39:46.370 align:start position:0%
construction appeals as well so this was
confusing

03:39:46.370 --> 03:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
03:39:49.250 --> 03:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
as it seems to carve out
 
03:39:51.769 --> 03:39:51.779 align:start position:0%
um also noting the fiscal note from the
 
03:39:53.830 --> 03:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
municipal Association
 
03:39:57.050 --> 03:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
we're in agreement that um
 
03:39:59.330 --> 03:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
not really sure how this how you would
 
03:40:02.750 --> 03:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
make online 10 of the bill uh kind of
 
03:40:05.570 --> 03:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
guessing what the proposed attorney fees
 
03:40:08.150 --> 03:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
would be and then how that would all
 
03:40:11.570 --> 03:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
work out so having two attorneys that
 
03:40:13.729 --> 03:40:13.739 align:start position:0%
represent construction and contractors
 
03:40:17.269 --> 03:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
tell us that I think we'd rather see the
 
03:40:21.110 --> 03:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
the existing laws stay the same as this
 
03:40:25.130 --> 03:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
would add costs and it would confuse the
 
03:40:27.410 --> 03:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
current system because you can have
 
03:40:31.130 --> 03:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
cases where different parties appeal not
 
03:40:34.190 --> 03:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
just as described in this bill so I just
 
03:40:36.110 --> 03:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to put that on the record with
 
03:40:38.870 --> 03:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
the committee that it may appear at
 
03:40:41.290 --> 03:40:41.300 align:start position:0%
first read that this helps
 
03:40:44.450 --> 03:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
an applicant who represents a commercial
 
03:40:47.210 --> 03:40:47.220 align:start position:0%
site but we're not so sure it does and
 
03:40:50.870 --> 03:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
it might add more confusion so we do not
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
support this legislation that's
 
03:40:54.650 --> 03:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
currently drafted
 
03:40:57.290 --> 03:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
and be happy to answer any questions
 
03:41:02.030 --> 03:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:05.630 --> 03:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I do not see any other hands
 
03:41:09.110 --> 03:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
raised from either the committee or from
 
03:41:11.630 --> 03:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
the folks who are in the public
 
03:41:13.849 --> 03:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
hey uh representative majority did you
 
03:41:16.250 --> 03:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
have a question on this oh no I'm sorry
 
03:41:18.229 --> 03:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
if I had my hand up but I will tell you
 
03:41:20.510 --> 03:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I have looked in every way that
 
03:41:21.530 --> 03:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
I can
 
03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
think of to try to find representative
 
03:41:27.229 --> 03:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
baruti under his first name his last
 
03:41:30.110 --> 03:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
name under rep and I I apologize I just
 
03:41:32.330 --> 03:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
cannot find him here and I don't see
 
03:41:32.340 --> 03:41:33.229 align:start position:0%
cannot find him here and I don't see
anything

03:41:33.229 --> 03:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:41:36.590 --> 03:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh with an odd uh with an odd title to
 
03:41:38.210 --> 03:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
make me even think that he might be
 
03:41:40.429 --> 03:41:40.439 align:start position:0%
there under that so I I've looked every
 
03:41:41.929 --> 03:41:41.939 align:start position:0%
way that I can
 
03:41:43.790 --> 03:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I want to thank all the
 
03:41:45.229 --> 03:41:45.239 align:start position:0%

this afternoon to introduce Bill 588 uh
 
03:43:42.530 --> 03:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
it's a bill that would the first time
 
03:43:47.210 --> 03:43:47.220 align:start position:0%
allow tiny houses into New Hampshire uh
 
03:43:50.269 --> 03:43:50.279 align:start position:0%

representative majority uh put together
 
03:43:56.290 --> 03:43:56.300 align:start position:0%
with me which actually
 
03:43:58.910 --> 03:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
essentially takes the bill and takes the
 
03:44:00.769 --> 03:44:00.779 align:start position:0%
wheels off the
 
03:44:03.530 --> 03:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
the tiny home because we ran into a
 
03:44:06.889 --> 03:44:06.899 align:start position:0%
series of difficulties and questions so
 
03:44:10.929 --> 03:44:10.939 align:start position:0%

03:45:48.229 --> 03:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
years now and as I tried to to develop
 
03:45:48.239 --> 03:45:49.429 align:start position:0%
years now and as I tried to to develop
it

03:45:49.429 --> 03:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:45:51.710 --> 03:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
um at least the zoning uh I ran into a
 
03:45:54.410 --> 03:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
brick wall that basically has the state
 
03:45:58.010 --> 03:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
has no Zoning for it so um what what the
 
03:45:59.870 --> 03:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
deal is here is we'd like to pattern
 
03:46:02.630 --> 03:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
this after existing legislation already
 
03:46:04.849 --> 03:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
on the books which is the manufactured
 
03:46:07.729 --> 03:46:07.739 align:start position:0%
housing Park zoning except that that
 
03:46:09.830 --> 03:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
manufactured House Park zoning the does
 
03:46:12.650 --> 03:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
not relate in terms of building
 
03:46:14.929 --> 03:46:14.939 align:start position:0%
requirements and specifications that a
 
03:46:17.630 --> 03:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
tiny home would so this bill was
 
03:46:20.870 --> 03:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
originally introduced as HB 312 about a
 
03:46:23.750 --> 03:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
year and a half ago and Governor sununu
 
03:46:26.990 --> 03:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
thought that it deserved more more
 
03:46:29.750 --> 03:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
attention more information and he was
 
03:46:32.870 --> 03:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
kind enough uh to put together a study
 
03:46:35.349 --> 03:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
committee which I believe
 
03:46:38.570 --> 03:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
Representatives majority uh testerman
 
03:46:40.849 --> 03:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
and representative stavis were on there
 
03:46:43.790 --> 03:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
along with uh Senator Martha Fuller
 
03:46:46.670 --> 03:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
Clark and so we studied this over the
 
03:46:48.490 --> 03:46:48.500 align:start position:0%
summer months and
 
03:46:51.110 --> 03:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
actually got introduced in the Senate
 
03:46:53.389 --> 03:46:53.399 align:start position:0%
with sponsorship by Senator Clark but
 
03:46:55.969 --> 03:46:55.979 align:start position:0%
covet hit and and that became the end of
 
03:46:57.650 --> 03:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
that so
 
03:47:00.769 --> 03:47:00.779 align:start position:0%
um so now it's it's coming back in with
 
03:47:03.650 --> 03:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
our original sponsor Dave testerman and
 
03:47:05.929 --> 03:47:05.939 align:start position:0%
uh bringing on uh representative
 
03:47:09.290 --> 03:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
maggiori who was on the study committee
 
03:47:12.889 --> 03:47:12.899 align:start position:0%
so um that that's kind of the background
 
03:47:15.530 --> 03:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
there what I've provided for you with or
 
03:47:18.110 --> 03:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
my notes and a PowerPoint for the last
 
03:47:19.849 --> 03:47:19.859 align:start position:0%
two and a half years I've been attending
 
03:47:21.830 --> 03:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh breakfast from the virtual community
 
03:47:25.910 --> 03:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
group up in Hanover the Bia uh Saint
 
03:47:29.870 --> 03:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
anselms uh ethics webinars and we've all
 
03:47:32.030 --> 03:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
had the same people coming on lamenting
 
03:47:34.910 --> 03:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh that we don't have a sufficient
 
03:47:37.670 --> 03:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
amount of affordable Workforce housing
 
03:47:40.729 --> 03:47:40.739 align:start position:0%
stock in the state and the the problem
 
03:47:44.330 --> 03:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
has been all along is that the zoning
 
03:47:46.849 --> 03:47:46.859 align:start position:0%
um doesn't really uh provide for it and
 
03:47:50.150 --> 03:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of the bill so what I
 
03:47:51.950 --> 03:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
what I want to do is just talk about
 
03:47:54.110 --> 03:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
this is that New Hampshire needs to
 
03:47:55.849 --> 03:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
solve the problem of lack of affordable
 
03:47:57.650 --> 03:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
and Workforce housing for our young
 
03:48:00.050 --> 03:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
people to stay and be attracted to New
 
03:48:00.060 --> 03:48:00.889 align:start position:0%
people to stay and be attracted to New
Hampshire

03:48:00.889 --> 03:48:00.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:48:02.870 --> 03:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
if we do not provide this housing we
 
03:48:04.429 --> 03:48:04.439 align:start position:0%
will not have enough people to fill the
 
03:48:06.889 --> 03:48:06.899 align:start position:0%
jobs in our base Industries and in the
 
03:48:09.410 --> 03:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
hospitality industry if you cannot keep
 
03:48:11.150 --> 03:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
and attract the millennial population in
 
03:48:13.370 --> 03:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
our state our businesses will follow
 
03:48:15.469 --> 03:48:15.479 align:start position:0%
them out of state
 
03:48:17.210 --> 03:48:17.220 align:start position:0%
um where the in the South where the
 
03:48:19.610 --> 03:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
housing is less expensive and we will
 
03:48:22.309 --> 03:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
lose uh my fear is the vital business
 
03:48:25.550 --> 03:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
profits tax that really contributes to
 
03:48:28.550 --> 03:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
the social uh needs of our state our
 
03:48:31.370 --> 03:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
young people are managing significant
 
03:48:34.729 --> 03:48:34.739 align:start position:0%
student debt and they uh not only kind
 
03:48:37.550 --> 03:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
of not afford the average house in in
 
03:48:38.929 --> 03:48:38.939 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which is over three
 
03:48:41.150 --> 03:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars today uh but
 
03:48:43.309 --> 03:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
they want to live minimally they want to
 
03:48:46.070 --> 03:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
live large with less and that's what the
 
03:48:47.750 --> 03:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
tiny home
 
03:48:50.750 --> 03:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
um does for them uh they need housing
 
03:48:52.309 --> 03:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
that's less than a hundred thousand
 
03:48:55.969 --> 03:48:55.979 align:start position:0%
dollars uh in costs you could buy a
 
03:48:58.729 --> 03:48:58.739 align:start position:0%
modest uh tiny home for around fifty
 
03:49:01.010 --> 03:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and you can buy a
 
03:49:05.090 --> 03:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
luxurious one for around 85 000 and in
 
03:49:06.950 --> 03:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
the PowerPoint you see the the picture
 
03:49:09.410 --> 03:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
of of a luxurious this one that I've
 
03:49:11.290 --> 03:49:11.300 align:start position:0%
provided for you
 
03:49:13.490 --> 03:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is our Millennial
 
03:49:15.170 --> 03:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
population doesn't trust the housing
 
03:49:16.969 --> 03:49:16.979 align:start position:0%
cycle because they're going to be
 
03:49:19.550 --> 03:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
changing their jobs 10 to 15 times in
 
03:49:21.889 --> 03:49:21.899 align:start position:0%
their career uh I'm one of those old
 
03:49:24.469 --> 03:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
baby boomers and my college professor
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
told me I'd change jobs three times in
 
03:49:29.030 --> 03:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
my career and I did but those days are
 
03:49:32.030 --> 03:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
gone so they need that flexibility to
 
03:49:33.130 --> 03:49:33.140 align:start position:0%
move on
 
03:49:35.809 --> 03:49:35.819 align:start position:0%
so I I understand that the tiny houses
 
03:49:37.729 --> 03:49:37.739 align:start position:0%
on on Wheels have been taken out we can
 
03:49:40.550 --> 03:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
talk about that another time but the the
 
03:49:43.429 --> 03:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
have the tiny house on a foundation uh
 
03:49:46.030 --> 03:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
will actually move the needle and create
 
03:49:49.550 --> 03:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
really needed uh Workforce housing stock
 
03:49:52.429 --> 03:49:52.439 align:start position:0%
in the State uh that is not here right
 
03:49:52.439 --> 03:49:53.750 align:start position:0%
in the State uh that is not here right
now

03:49:53.750 --> 03:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:49:56.630 --> 03:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
um and so that's one of the reasons why
 
03:49:58.729 --> 03:49:58.739 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to make this happen again as
 
03:50:01.429 --> 03:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
a as a commercial real estate broker I
 
03:50:04.070 --> 03:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
what I do in my day job is is I find
 
03:50:06.769 --> 03:50:06.779 align:start position:0%
needs in the marketplace uh to keep our
 
03:50:10.550 --> 03:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
our businesses vital in and growing and
 
03:50:12.910 --> 03:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
this this came up as that need
 
03:50:16.490 --> 03:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
over the time we've had two groups uh
 
03:50:18.889 --> 03:50:18.899 align:start position:0%
neighbors neighbors of mine
 
03:50:22.070 --> 03:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
um uh one being the the municipal and uh
 
03:50:25.849 --> 03:50:25.859 align:start position:0%
town uh uh Association of which my
 
03:50:28.309 --> 03:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
friend Mr Cordell Johnson is I guess
 
03:50:31.309 --> 03:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
speaking to that today and uh the point
 
03:50:32.929 --> 03:50:32.939 align:start position:0%
that I need to drive home with those
 
03:50:34.849 --> 03:50:34.859 align:start position:0%
folks is that every form of Workforce
 
03:50:37.429 --> 03:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
housing in the state is mandatory it's
 
03:50:40.790 --> 03:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
not enabling legislation and we are so
 
03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
far behind in providing this housing
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
stock that uh it is imperative that that
 
03:50:48.769 --> 03:50:48.779 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:50:50.870 --> 03:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
ought to be passed uh and hopefully that
 
03:50:52.729 --> 03:50:52.739 align:start position:0%
it will be passed as as mandatory
 
03:50:55.849 --> 03:50:55.859 align:start position:0%
legislation uh just as uh every other
 
03:50:58.490 --> 03:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
form of Workforce housing is the other
 
03:51:00.590 --> 03:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
issue of one of my other neighbors of
 
03:51:03.170 --> 03:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
the building uh uh New Hampshire
 
03:51:05.929 --> 03:51:05.939 align:start position:0%
building officials Association
 
03:51:07.429 --> 03:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
um I've talked with them over the last
 
03:51:10.670 --> 03:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
couple of years and they are in favor
 
03:51:12.349 --> 03:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
um as I talked with with their president
 
03:51:16.010 --> 03:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
about a year ago of of working with the
 
03:51:18.889 --> 03:51:18.899 align:start position:0%
the requirements for uh Chinese homes on
 
03:51:21.889 --> 03:51:21.899 align:start position:0%
a foundation now what you folks
 
03:51:24.229 --> 03:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
um need to have in your in your
 
03:51:27.110 --> 03:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
understanding there is that the uh
 
03:51:29.570 --> 03:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
International residential uh code of
 
03:51:31.729 --> 03:51:31.739 align:start position:0%
which New Hampshire I believe is is
 
03:51:35.210 --> 03:51:35.220 align:start position:0%
using the 2009 version in the 2015
 
03:51:37.610 --> 03:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
version they finally
 
03:51:42.530 --> 03:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
um agreed and and uh gave uh uh interest
 
03:51:45.610 --> 03:51:45.620 align:start position:0%
to uh tiny homes and they've created
 
03:51:51.050 --> 03:51:51.060 align:start position:0%
appendix Q which uh provides for uh uh
 
03:51:53.809 --> 03:51:53.819 align:start position:0%
construction specifications that they
 
03:51:56.929 --> 03:51:56.939 align:start position:0%
think are are safe and warranted for a
 
03:51:59.389 --> 03:51:59.399 align:start position:0%
tiny home on the foundation so I say to
 
03:52:01.309 --> 03:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
my neighbors and and the building Owners
 
03:52:01.319 --> 03:52:03.110 align:start position:0%
my neighbors and and the building Owners
Association

03:52:03.110 --> 03:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
Association
 
03:52:04.610 --> 03:52:04.620 align:start position:0%
um that I hope that they would would
 
03:52:08.269 --> 03:52:08.279 align:start position:0%
join in accepting uh appendix Q uh even
 
03:52:11.150 --> 03:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
even though New Hampshire's Edition is
 
03:52:14.690 --> 03:52:14.700 align:start position:0%
is somewhat behind the times and so
 
03:52:19.670 --> 03:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
um just in closing it's it's uh again
 
03:52:20.990 --> 03:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
it's pretty simple because the
 
03:52:22.849 --> 03:52:22.859 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Park zoning is
 
03:52:24.889 --> 03:52:24.899 align:start position:0%
already on the books and if we could
 
03:52:28.849 --> 03:52:28.859 align:start position:0%
tailor our own Zoning for uh the tiny
 
03:52:31.790 --> 03:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
homes on a foundation uh we will go a
 
03:52:34.910 --> 03:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
long way to uh uh providing the badly
 
03:52:37.490 --> 03:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
needed housing stock under a hundred
 
03:52:39.469 --> 03:52:39.479 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that are Millennial
 
03:52:41.809 --> 03:52:41.819 align:start position:0%
population needs and wants thank you
 
03:52:43.070 --> 03:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
very much
 
03:52:46.370 --> 03:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr Mendola
 
03:52:47.870 --> 03:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
um are there any questions from Ms
 
03:52:50.750 --> 03:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
Mendel Mr chairman yes
 
03:52:52.790 --> 03:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
um before we proceed I'd like to inform
 
03:52:55.010 --> 03:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
you that we have nine people signed up
 
03:52:57.950 --> 03:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill and the time

have a quick question in terms of uh I
 
03:53:53.030 --> 03:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
understand the need for it and is there
 
03:53:57.410 --> 03:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
a limit on how many can go into one lot
 
03:54:01.190 --> 03:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
or one location how many tiny homes
 
03:54:03.830 --> 03:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
is there a level yeah that's an
 
03:54:05.870 --> 03:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
excellent question and again pattern is
 
03:54:07.910 --> 03:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
after the manufactured housing Park the
 
03:54:09.349 --> 03:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
only that's already in the books it's
 
03:54:12.410 --> 03:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
it's basically uh basically four units
 
03:54:15.650 --> 03:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
uh to an acre and that's what MHP allows
 
03:54:17.269 --> 03:54:17.279 align:start position:0%
and it's about ten thousand square foot
 
03:54:19.849 --> 03:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
lot and then the uh there's a lot of
 
03:54:22.610 --> 03:54:22.620 align:start position:0%
common area that uh that the community
 
03:54:24.950 --> 03:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
the community needs and wants so it'd be
 
03:54:30.349 --> 03:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:32.510 --> 03:54:32.520 align:start position:0%

03:55:08.090 --> 03:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
I'm not understanding the question could
 
03:55:13.070 --> 03:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:16.610 --> 03:55:16.620 align:start position:0%

03:55:50.510 --> 03:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's true you can either use Talent
 
03:55:53.689 --> 03:55:53.699 align:start position:0%
provided or otherwise it does allow and
 
03:55:56.689 --> 03:55:56.699 align:start position:0%
this is something that uh business
 
03:55:59.389 --> 03:55:59.399 align:start position:0%

03:59:13.010 --> 03:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
we felt that that was a vital part to
 
03:59:15.469 --> 03:59:15.479 align:start position:0%
moving forward as
 
03:59:18.950 --> 03:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
um Mr Mendoza testified earlier I want
 
03:59:20.210 --> 03:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
to correct him a little bit New
 
03:59:23.710 --> 03:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is currently on the 2015
 
03:59:27.229 --> 03:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
Residential Building Code oh good and it
 
03:59:31.910 --> 03:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
was 2018 where the ICC the the producers
 
03:59:34.370 --> 03:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
of the building codes for the first time
 
03:59:36.650 --> 03:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
moved forward and gave a definition of
 
03:59:39.410 --> 03:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
what a tiny home is and that was indeed
 
03:59:41.929 --> 03:59:41.939 align:start position:0%
appendix Q
 
03:59:45.170 --> 03:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
um and there's a a small appendix queue
 
03:59:47.630 --> 03:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
was moved forward by the New Hampshire
 
03:59:49.910 --> 03:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
building code review board
 
03:59:51.650 --> 03:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure if representative
 
03:59:53.990 --> 03:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
majority was going to talk about this in
 
03:59:56.809 --> 03:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
a little bit but um there may need to be
 
03:59:59.330 --> 03:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
another Amendment added to this bill to
 
04:00:02.269 --> 04:00:02.279 align:start position:0%
get appendix Q into legislation because
 
04:00:04.790 --> 04:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
somehow it was missed
 
04:00:08.150 --> 04:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the house bill I believe 17 and
 
04:00:10.910 --> 04:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 57 which was going to ratify
 
04:00:13.490 --> 04:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
other amendments to the building code so
 
04:00:16.550 --> 04:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
that needs to be added in somewhere
 
04:00:18.130 --> 04:00:18.140 align:start position:0%
I agree
 
04:00:20.689 --> 04:00:20.699 align:start position:0%
representative if you're to answer your
 
04:00:23.090 --> 04:00:23.100 align:start position:0%
question regarding a foundation the
 
04:00:24.950 --> 04:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
building code says that any residence
 
04:00:26.990 --> 04:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be attached to a permanent
 
04:00:27.000 --> 04:00:28.490 align:start position:0%
needs to be attached to a permanent
foundation

04:00:28.490 --> 04:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
foundation
 
04:00:31.729 --> 04:00:31.739 align:start position:0%
depending on the size of the home that
 
04:00:34.670 --> 04:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
is typically a frost protected
 
04:00:37.969 --> 04:00:37.979 align:start position:0%
Foundation which goes down anywhere from
 
04:00:40.910 --> 04:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
36 inches to 48 inches maybe more in
 
04:00:42.349 --> 04:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
some parts of the state
 
04:00:44.450 --> 04:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
that can be
 
04:00:44.460 --> 04:00:46.189 align:start position:0%
that can be
concrete

04:00:46.189 --> 04:00:46.199 align:start position:0%
concrete
 
04:00:48.650 --> 04:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
concrete block or believe it or not it
 
04:00:50.570 --> 04:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
can even be wood and it can be a slab on
 
04:00:52.849 --> 04:00:52.859 align:start position:0%
grade based on the building code so
 
04:00:54.170 --> 04:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
there's multiple ways that you can
 
04:00:58.309 --> 04:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:59.990 --> 04:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to answer any more
 
04:01:00.000 --> 04:01:03.650 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to answer any more
questions

04:01:03.650 --> 04:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:05.630 --> 04:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative lasalles has a
 
04:01:05.640 --> 04:01:06.410 align:start position:0%
uh representative lasalles has a
question

04:01:06.410 --> 04:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:01:06.420 --> 04:01:07.670 align:start position:0%
question
yes

04:01:07.670 --> 04:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:01:10.550 --> 04:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
04:01:13.490 --> 04:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
how does this
 
04:01:13.500 --> 04:01:15.050 align:start position:0%
how does this
proposal

04:01:15.050 --> 04:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
04:01:17.750 --> 04:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
differ from current
 
04:01:21.110 --> 04:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh ordinances concerning mobile home
 
04:01:21.120 --> 04:01:23.450 align:start position:0%
uh ordinances concerning mobile home
parks

04:01:23.450 --> 04:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
parks
 
04:01:26.870 --> 04:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
I two totally different creatures
 
04:01:30.469 --> 04:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
um manufactured homes are regulated by
 
04:01:32.450 --> 04:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
hype which is a governmental
 
04:01:34.429 --> 04:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
organization that does third-party
 
04:01:36.410 --> 04:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
inspections on how they're constructed
 
04:01:38.570 --> 04:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
and what standards they're built to
 
04:01:40.910 --> 04:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
a tiny home will be built to the
 
04:01:43.070 --> 04:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
international building code which is
 
04:01:47.510 --> 04:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
done by local Town building inspectors
 
04:01:49.070 --> 04:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's done through the international
 
04:01:50.990 --> 04:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
residential code two totally different
 
04:01:54.469 --> 04:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
creatures as far as building lies zoning
 
04:01:57.469 --> 04:01:57.479 align:start position:0%
wise I'm really not the person that can
 
04:02:00.290 --> 04:02:00.300 align:start position:0%
testify to zoning I think individual
 
04:02:02.630 --> 04:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
towns create their own zoning amendments
 
04:02:04.849 --> 04:02:04.859 align:start position:0%
and they need to fit it in as best they
 
04:02:08.809 --> 04:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:11.510 --> 04:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you okay are there any other
 
04:02:14.870 --> 04:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I see representative air has
 
04:02:19.309 --> 04:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
his hand raised
 
04:02:21.830 --> 04:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative here we have a
 
04:02:23.870 --> 04:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you chairman for
 
04:02:25.370 --> 04:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:02:28.969 --> 04:02:28.979 align:start position:0%
so if you have a one acre house lot
 
04:02:32.210 --> 04:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
you want to divide that into four
 
04:02:36.170 --> 04:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
so if your zoning says it's a one acre
 
04:02:39.410 --> 04:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
lot you're gonna spot Zone that lot into
 
04:02:41.150 --> 04:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
four Lots
 
04:02:43.550 --> 04:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
again I'm not really the person to
 
04:02:48.530 --> 04:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
testify to the zoning portion of of this
 
04:02:50.389 --> 04:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm just here for the building
 
04:02:53.410 --> 04:02:53.420 align:start position:0%
code portion of it
 
04:02:57.290 --> 04:02:57.300 align:start position:0%
representative power may I speak to that
 
04:02:59.929 --> 04:02:59.939 align:start position:0%
yes you've made yeah
 
04:03:01.189 --> 04:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
um uh thanks for the question
 
04:03:04.490 --> 04:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
representative air uh technically you
 
04:03:06.290 --> 04:03:06.300 align:start position:0%
you could be right because in the
 
04:03:08.050 --> 04:03:08.060 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Park zoning
 
04:03:10.250 --> 04:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing Housing parks are allowed
 
04:03:13.610 --> 04:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
anywhere uh where a single family uh
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
residential dwelling or multi-family
 
04:03:19.370 --> 04:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
residential dwellings are allowed and so
 
04:03:22.490 --> 04:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
in that particular area
 
04:03:25.010 --> 04:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
um it's governed by the the size of the
 
04:03:28.010 --> 04:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
lot for that community so
 
04:03:30.469 --> 04:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
um a one acre lot may not be large
 
04:03:34.010 --> 04:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
enough to do that but uh the purpose of
 
04:03:35.689 --> 04:03:35.699 align:start position:0%
the of the of the ten thousand square
 
04:03:37.849 --> 04:03:37.859 align:start position:0%
foot lot is what we're trying to do is
 
04:03:40.429 --> 04:03:40.439 align:start position:0%
get Parks going so that we can provide
 
04:03:42.710 --> 04:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
enough housing and so we're looking at a
 
04:03:46.910 --> 04:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
larger piece of ground 10 15 20 acres so
 
04:03:48.590 --> 04:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
my understanding in doing the research
 
04:03:50.389 --> 04:03:50.399 align:start position:0%
is that if you want to put it in a Zone
 
04:03:53.210 --> 04:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
where say there's you know two acre
 
04:03:55.070 --> 04:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
zoning whatever it is
 
04:03:57.290 --> 04:03:57.300 align:start position:0%
um you might need a variance from the
 
04:04:00.050 --> 04:04:00.060 align:start position:0%
the uh from the zoning board of appeals
 
04:04:01.729 --> 04:04:01.739 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:04:05.030 --> 04:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
yes uh excuse me uh Mr Mandola next time
 
04:04:07.729 --> 04:04:07.739 align:start position:0%
you want to answer a question address it
 
04:04:10.729 --> 04:04:10.739 align:start position:0%
here please okay thank you
 
04:04:16.550 --> 04:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:20.570 --> 04:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
next person to signed up to testify
 
04:04:21.889 --> 04:04:21.899 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:04:25.250 --> 04:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
um Ms Jacqueline Walker yes is Miss
 
04:04:28.429 --> 04:04:28.439 align:start position:0%
Jacqueline Walker on the line
 
04:04:30.410 --> 04:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
representative status has a question I
 
04:04:33.170 --> 04:04:33.180 align:start position:0%

think oh sorry
um

04:04:34.210 --> 04:04:34.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:37.729 --> 04:04:37.739 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I can wait until
 
04:04:39.830 --> 04:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
um after the testimony is delivered I'm
 
04:04:46.490 --> 04:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:49.429 --> 04:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
um this walker is
 
04:04:51.590 --> 04:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
lined up could she raise could you
 
04:05:02.150 --> 04:05:02.160 align:start position:0%

uh if you have a testimony you would
 
04:05:34.130 --> 04:05:34.140 align:start position:0%

good afternoon my name is Jackie Walker
 
04:05:47.330 --> 04:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
and I would like to testify in support
 
04:05:49.790 --> 04:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 588
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
um I Echo many of the points that Mr
 
04:05:53.030 --> 04:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
Mendola said so I will try to keep this
 
04:05:57.410 --> 04:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
brief and only add new information I
 
04:05:59.150 --> 04:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
been a resident of New Hampshire for
 
04:06:01.790 --> 04:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
four years now all those in Dover for
 
04:06:02.870 --> 04:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
three years we lived an apartment
 
04:06:04.790 --> 04:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
building constructed in
 
04:06:07.429 --> 04:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
in 1880 we were able to find a place for
 
04:06:08.990 --> 04:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
what is considered a bargain in Dover
 
04:06:13.070 --> 04:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:15.950 --> 04:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
and infestations amongst appliances
 
04:06:18.170 --> 04:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
difficult and dangerous neighbors the
 
04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
heating was inefficient inefficient the
 
04:06:21.769 --> 04:06:21.779 align:start position:0%
wiring was faulty
 
04:06:23.630 --> 04:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
um and we dealt with a lot that was
 
04:06:25.550 --> 04:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
beyond our control
 
04:06:28.490 --> 04:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
um for this past year I've been living
 
04:06:30.769 --> 04:06:30.779 align:start position:0%
in a tiny home that was built by a
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
professional contractor insulated with
 
04:06:34.309 --> 04:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency in mind and the wiring
 
04:06:36.050 --> 04:06:36.060 align:start position:0%
was installed and inspected by a
 
04:06:37.370 --> 04:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
licensed professional less than two
 
04:06:40.309 --> 04:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
years ago while we do have wheels on our
 
04:06:42.530 --> 04:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
home the taxes is lifted by concrete
 
04:06:44.150 --> 04:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
blocks and we are anchored to the ground
 
04:06:46.910 --> 04:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
using higher requirements than those
 
04:06:48.769 --> 04:06:48.779 align:start position:0%
that currently exist for mobile homes in
 
04:06:50.570 --> 04:06:50.580 align:start position:0%
our area designed to withstand High
 
04:06:54.229 --> 04:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
category hurricane force winds when
 
04:06:55.729 --> 04:06:55.739 align:start position:0%
looking for a place to park and live in
 
04:06:58.010 --> 04:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
our tiny house we heard from five
 
04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
interested homeowners in Dover alone as
 
04:07:03.229 --> 04:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
well as from others around the state so
 
04:07:04.849 --> 04:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
the interest is there for both those who
 
04:07:06.530 --> 04:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
want to live in tiny homes and for
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
traditional homeowners interested in
 
04:07:09.830 --> 04:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
hosting tiny homes
 
04:07:11.450 --> 04:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
the state has an affordable housing
 
04:07:14.150 --> 04:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
crisis and also an aging population A
 
04:07:15.469 --> 04:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
diversity of housing options such as
 
04:07:17.389 --> 04:07:17.399 align:start position:0%
tiny houses can make a big impact in
 
04:07:19.790 --> 04:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
alleviating these two issues I want to
 
04:07:21.170 --> 04:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
know also that New Hampshire is being
 
04:07:23.150 --> 04:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
given a huge opportunity to become the
 
04:07:24.410 --> 04:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
first state to accept tiny homes
 
04:07:26.689 --> 04:07:26.699 align:start position:0%
Statewide even California and Texas only
 
04:07:28.490 --> 04:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
have a few cities and more rural areas
 
04:07:30.610 --> 04:07:30.620 align:start position:0%
where tiny homes are explicitly allowed
 
04:07:32.809 --> 04:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
there are already dozens of people like
 
04:07:34.610 --> 04:07:34.620 align:start position:0%
me living full-time in tiny homes around
 
04:07:36.530 --> 04:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and many of us want to be
 
04:07:38.170 --> 04:07:38.180 align:start position:0%
contributing members of our communities
 
04:07:42.590 --> 04:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
we want to be recognized and to be

any are there any questions for this
Witness

04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:12.410 --> 04:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I do not see any
 
04:08:15.290 --> 04:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
um anybody with the hand raised okay I'd
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
like to recognize representative status
 
04:08:20.510 --> 04:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
with a question
 
04:08:22.849 --> 04:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:08:25.250 --> 04:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
um this is a question for uh
 
04:08:26.929 --> 04:08:26.939 align:start position:0%
representative testerman and
 
04:08:29.630 --> 04:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
representative majori
 
04:08:31.910 --> 04:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and this was something that came up
 
04:08:36.710 --> 04:08:36.720 align:start position:0%
in our study group a year ago where I
 
04:08:38.750 --> 04:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
raised the issue of homeowners
 
04:08:41.870 --> 04:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
associations and the laws or the lack
 
04:08:43.370 --> 04:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
thereof in New Hampshire that govern
 
04:08:47.809 --> 04:08:47.819 align:start position:0%
them and my concern is in
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
tiny house communities and how how do
 
04:08:55.309 --> 04:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
towns and cities are indeed the state
 
04:08:55.319 --> 04:08:56.110 align:start position:0%
towns and cities are indeed the state
um

04:08:56.110 --> 04:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:59.570 --> 04:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
keep track of or support these
 
04:09:01.849 --> 04:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
communities as they attempt to govern
 
04:09:05.330 --> 04:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
themselves it's tough enough to do it in
 
04:09:07.490 --> 04:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
existing homeowners associations where
 
04:09:10.610 --> 04:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely no State legislation
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
that supports uh any of the bylaws or
 
04:09:18.229 --> 04:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:18.239 --> 04:09:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:09:19.910 --> 04:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:09:22.130 --> 04:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
representative Testament is not here but
 
04:09:23.929 --> 04:09:23.939 align:start position:0%
uh representative majority would you
 
04:09:27.650 --> 04:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:29.450 --> 04:09:29.460 align:start position:0%
um sure thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:09:31.670 --> 04:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative stavis for asking me the
 
04:09:33.110 --> 04:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
tough questions and putting me on the
 
04:09:37.070 --> 04:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:39.229 --> 04:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
um and I I do remember that from our
 
04:09:41.030 --> 04:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
from our study committee and it's an
 
04:09:45.410 --> 04:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
excellent question uh one that that one
 
04:09:48.050 --> 04:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
that I regret that I cannot come up with
 
04:09:51.110 --> 04:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
a specific answer for you uh I don't
 
04:09:53.330 --> 04:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
want to liken it I don't want to liken
 
04:09:55.309 --> 04:09:55.319 align:start position:0%
what will happen to any other industry
 
04:09:57.290 --> 04:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
we cannot say this would be like what
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
would happen in a manufactured home park
 
04:10:00.530 --> 04:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
or like what would happen in a
 
04:10:02.330 --> 04:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
Condominium Association or like what
 
04:10:04.429 --> 04:10:04.439 align:start position:0%
would happen in a campground because a
 
04:10:07.189 --> 04:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
tiny home is none of those things a tiny
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
home and if there would be a tiny home
 
04:10:12.710 --> 04:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
park or different or or different
 
04:10:15.950 --> 04:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
animals unto themselves I would hope
 
04:10:19.550 --> 04:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
that any type of any type of Association
 
04:10:22.450 --> 04:10:22.460 align:start position:0%
or rules that would be governed there
 
04:10:25.429 --> 04:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
would be a part of a cooperative and a
 
04:10:27.590 --> 04:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
part of a comprehensive agreement that
 
04:10:30.170 --> 04:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
could be done cooperatively with at the
 
04:10:32.570 --> 04:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
local level but I regret representative
 
04:10:35.150 --> 04:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
Davis that I can't give you an answer a
 
04:10:37.309 --> 04:10:37.319 align:start position:0%
specific answer to your question nor do
 
04:10:39.050 --> 04:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
I think that in my rambling I've even
 
04:10:41.750 --> 04:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
given you any direction so Mr chair
 
04:10:44.090 --> 04:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
could I have a follow-up yes one
 
04:10:48.349 --> 04:10:48.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up so I wonder if you um I guess
 
04:10:50.150 --> 04:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative Chesterman is no longer
 
04:10:52.429 --> 04:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
here I wonder if you might think this of
 
04:10:54.650 --> 04:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
this as an opportunity
 
04:10:56.510 --> 04:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
not so much as a challenge but an
 
04:10:56.520 --> 04:10:57.830 align:start position:0%
not so much as a challenge but an
opportunity

04:10:57.830 --> 04:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
04:11:01.849 --> 04:11:01.859 align:start position:0%
to use the um
 
04:11:03.410 --> 04:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
you know the presence of tiny house
 
04:11:06.429 --> 04:11:06.439 align:start position:0%
communities to strengthen New Hampshire
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
legislation governing homeowners
 
04:11:08.640 --> 04:11:12.650 align:start position:0%
legislation governing homeowners
associations

04:11:12.650 --> 04:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.769 --> 04:11:15.779 align:start position:0%
if I I can certainly thank you again for
 
04:11:18.050 --> 04:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
the question and I'd be more than happy
 
04:11:20.809 --> 04:11:20.819 align:start position:0%
to speak with representative testerman
 
04:11:23.750 --> 04:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
and work with you also to see if there's
 
04:11:28.670 --> 04:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:32.809 --> 04:11:32.819 align:start position:0%
okay are there any more questions uh
 
04:11:35.570 --> 04:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
Mr chair representative Tripp has a
 
04:11:41.090 --> 04:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
Mr representative Maggiore
 
04:11:46.790 --> 04:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things that uh when I was
 
04:11:50.210 --> 04:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
reviewing this last night is uh I saw
 
04:11:52.370 --> 04:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
where this is basically enabling
 
04:11:55.309 --> 04:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
legislation and that the municipalities
 
04:11:58.610 --> 04:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
have to develop Sony
 
04:12:02.929 --> 04:12:02.939 align:start position:0%
ordinances pursuant to this uh
 
04:12:07.610 --> 04:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
would that be where uh such items as uh
 
04:12:07.620 --> 04:12:09.969 align:start position:0%
would that be where uh such items as uh
dimensional

04:12:09.969 --> 04:12:09.979 align:start position:0%
dimensional
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
requirements would be included
 
04:12:15.769 --> 04:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
disowning ordinance thank you
 
04:12:18.050 --> 04:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp for the question
 
04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
and the dimensional requirements for a
 
04:12:25.490 --> 04:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
tiny home are specifically outlined in
 
04:12:28.070 --> 04:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
appendix Q
 
04:12:30.769 --> 04:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
um appendix Q if if you don't have I can
 
04:12:32.570 --> 04:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
certainly send to you make sure that you
 
04:12:35.510 --> 04:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
have but within appendix q a tiny home
 
04:12:38.870 --> 04:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
is listed as a as a dwelling 400 square
 
04:12:41.570 --> 04:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
feet or less I don't know if that
 
04:12:43.969 --> 04:12:43.979 align:start position:0%
answers your question specifically but
 
04:12:46.070 --> 04:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
again I can send you appendix Q to see
 
04:12:48.170 --> 04:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
if it might address that question and
 
04:12:50.269 --> 04:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
any others
 
04:12:52.130 --> 04:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
I have a second question
 
04:12:54.469 --> 04:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
the reason I asked the question is it
 
04:12:58.429 --> 04:12:58.439 align:start position:0%
seemed to be a hole in in the
 
04:13:03.290 --> 04:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
04:13:07.849 --> 04:13:07.859 align:start position:0%
will dependent 2 be referenced in say
 
04:13:09.830 --> 04:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
the zoning ordinance
 
04:13:12.290 --> 04:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for the
 
04:13:15.170 --> 04:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
question and Mr Paquin from the building
 
04:13:18.110 --> 04:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
officials Association uh brought us
 
04:13:21.410 --> 04:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
right down to that path and I am looking
 
04:13:24.110 --> 04:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
at how this bill may have to be amended
 
04:13:26.630 --> 04:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the references in
 
04:13:30.290 --> 04:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
appendix Q as adopted by uh the The
 
04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
Building Association or Builders
 
04:13:34.130 --> 04:13:34.140 align:start position:0%
Association building us now I'm messing
 
04:13:36.170 --> 04:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
that all up but to make sure that those
 
04:13:39.170 --> 04:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
are all Incorporated within the bill
 
04:13:41.389 --> 04:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
um because it because as this may be
 
04:13:44.630 --> 04:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
tangential again a tiny home is a
 
04:13:47.750 --> 04:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
specific creature it's not a small house
 
04:13:51.170 --> 04:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
you can have a small house I think the
 
04:13:52.849 --> 04:13:52.859 align:start position:0%
smallest you can have is 70 square feet
 
04:13:57.229 --> 04:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
a tiny home is very very specific so
 
04:13:59.450 --> 04:13:59.460 align:start position:0%
um I think we are working on and I will
 
04:14:02.210 --> 04:14:02.220 align:start position:0%
work with Mr Paquin on an amendment to
 
04:14:05.689 --> 04:14:05.699 align:start position:0%
make sure that we we plug that hole that
 
04:14:08.330 --> 04:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
you that you are referring to
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering my question
 
04:14:12.950 --> 04:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative majority I will
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh move this uh to exec on Monday if
 
04:14:18.650 --> 04:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
that'll give you some extra time to do
 
04:14:18.660 --> 04:14:19.429 align:start position:0%
that'll give you some extra time to do
that

04:14:19.429 --> 04:14:19.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:22.010 --> 04:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that Mr chair I'm uh I I
 
04:14:24.050 --> 04:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
will apologize but I was working on it
 
04:14:25.790 --> 04:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
while we were talking to see if I could
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
actually get it done before the end of
 
04:14:28.910 --> 04:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
the day but I will have it to you by
 
04:14:30.769 --> 04:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
Monday for sure thank you very much
 
04:14:33.410 --> 04:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to rep uh recognize
 
04:14:36.590 --> 04:14:36.600 align:start position:0%

would like to keep it together so we we
 
04:14:45.469 --> 04:14:45.479 align:start position:0%
are about quite a bit behind right now I
 
04:14:49.790 --> 04:14:49.800 align:start position:0%

Association and I promises will be the
 
04:15:00.769 --> 04:15:00.779 align:start position:0%
last bill I oppose today at least in
 
04:15:02.330 --> 04:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
04:15:04.849 --> 04:15:04.859 align:start position:0%
um this once again is something that we
 
04:15:06.710 --> 04:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
believe should be addressed on the local
 
04:15:06.720 --> 04:15:08.450 align:start position:0%
believe should be addressed on the local
level

04:15:08.450 --> 04:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:15:12.830 --> 04:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
um if if people want to build or develop
 
04:15:15.950 --> 04:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
tiny homes uh zoning ordinance can be
 
04:15:18.290 --> 04:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances can be Fashions to
 
04:15:21.830 --> 04:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
allow that uh basically what the bill
 
04:15:24.830 --> 04:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
says is that you can't it essentially
 
04:15:27.710 --> 04:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
eliminates any minimum size requirements
 
04:15:31.550 --> 04:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
for homes in any municipality and
 
04:15:31.560 --> 04:15:32.290 align:start position:0%
for homes in any municipality and
um

04:15:32.290 --> 04:15:32.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:34.490 --> 04:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
again that's something that ought to be
 
04:15:37.670 --> 04:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
done at the local level the
 
04:15:37.680 --> 04:15:38.330 align:start position:0%
done at the local level the
um

04:15:38.330 --> 04:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh state law already requires uh
 
04:15:43.370 --> 04:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
municipalities to allow Workforce
 
04:15:45.830 --> 04:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
housing to allow manufactured housing to
 
04:15:48.530 --> 04:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
allow avus
 
04:15:51.229 --> 04:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
um the idea that now allowing them
 
04:15:55.309 --> 04:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
requiring them to allow uh tiny homes is
 
04:15:58.250 --> 04:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
going to solve the affordable housing
 
04:16:01.429 --> 04:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
crisis I think is
 
04:16:04.010 --> 04:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
um extremely optimistic
 
04:16:07.010 --> 04:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
I'll note that the governor had a task
 
04:16:10.490 --> 04:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
force on affordable housing which made a
 
04:16:12.050 --> 04:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
number of recommendations one of which
 
04:16:14.389 --> 04:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
was House Bill 586 which was in this
 
04:16:17.330 --> 04:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
Committee in which we did not oppose
 
04:16:17.340 --> 04:16:18.170 align:start position:0%
Committee in which we did not oppose
um

04:16:18.170 --> 04:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:21.229 --> 04:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
but it its recommendations as far as I
 
04:16:24.229 --> 04:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
know said nothing about tiny homes
 
04:16:25.729 --> 04:16:25.739 align:start position:0%
um you I don't think you're going to
 
04:16:27.469 --> 04:16:27.479 align:start position:0%
hear New Hampshire Housing Finance
 
04:16:29.330 --> 04:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
Authority speak in support of this bill
 
04:16:30.950 --> 04:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
if they thought it would make a
 
04:16:33.830 --> 04:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
significant dent in the housing
 
04:16:35.990 --> 04:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
affordability problem I assure you they
 
04:16:38.570 --> 04:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
would be here in support of it as a
 
04:16:42.349 --> 04:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
realistic matter it's it's not going to
 
04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
um and to require every every city and
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
town in the state to amend its zoning
 
04:16:51.349 --> 04:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
ordinance to allow something that very
 
04:16:54.170 --> 04:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
few people are really interested in
 
04:16:58.189 --> 04:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
doing uh I think is just going overboard
 
04:17:01.790 --> 04:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
I live in a town that has no minimum
 
04:17:04.250 --> 04:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
size requirement for homes I actually
 
04:17:07.010 --> 04:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
live in something that is almost within
 
04:17:08.990 --> 04:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
the definition of a tiny home it's mine
 
04:17:12.950 --> 04:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
is 540 square feet I am pretty sure I I
 
04:17:16.010 --> 04:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
live in the smallest house in town
 
04:17:19.910 --> 04:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
um if if this were a real solution to uh
 
04:17:21.950 --> 04:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
the housing shortage
 
04:17:23.929 --> 04:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
um tiny homes would be springing up all
 
04:17:26.210 --> 04:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
over the place in Henniker and that has
 
04:17:27.889 --> 04:17:27.899 align:start position:0%
not happened
 
04:17:32.689 --> 04:17:32.699 align:start position:0%
um so I strongly suggest that
 
04:17:34.490 --> 04:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
um these matters be left to
 
04:17:37.969 --> 04:17:37.979 align:start position:0%
municipalities and if people want their
 
04:17:40.309 --> 04:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
town to allow tiny homes they can get
 
04:17:41.990 --> 04:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
get them to amend the zoning ordinance
 
04:17:44.090 --> 04:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
if necessary in many cases it may not
 
04:17:46.010 --> 04:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
even be necessary
 
04:17:48.349 --> 04:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
I went there and be happy to answer
 
04:17:48.359 --> 04:17:49.729 align:start position:0%
I went there and be happy to answer
questions

04:17:49.729 --> 04:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:17:51.590 --> 04:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much and I said that
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%

04:18:03.530 --> 04:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I did not see any committee
 
04:18:06.950 --> 04:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
members with the hands raised currently
 
04:18:10.490 --> 04:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your testimony and
 
04:18:11.929 --> 04:18:11.939 align:start position:0%
you know Bob Potter
 
04:18:25.010 --> 04:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:27.969 --> 04:18:27.979 align:start position:0%
it was the top
 
04:18:30.229 --> 04:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
are you online
 
04:18:32.750 --> 04:18:32.760 align:start position:0%

04:18:36.530 --> 04:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I thought go right ahead okay
 
04:18:38.570 --> 04:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
thank you uh good afternoon Mr chair and
 
04:18:40.429 --> 04:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh and thank
 
04:18:42.290 --> 04:18:42.300 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to comment on
 
04:18:45.950 --> 04:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill 588 my name is Rob tardiff I
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
am the administrator of the subsurface
 
04:18:50.150 --> 04:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
systems Bureau within the Department of
 
04:18:51.650 --> 04:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
04:18:55.189 --> 04:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak specifically relative
 
04:18:55.199 --> 04:18:56.389 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak specifically relative
to

04:18:56.389 --> 04:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:18:59.389 --> 04:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
uh the provisions in the bill to allow
 
04:19:01.969 --> 04:19:01.979 align:start position:0%
self-contained Water and Wastewater
 
04:19:04.429 --> 04:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
uh currently the department does not
 
04:19:07.910 --> 04:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
allow for self-contained Wastewater in
 
04:19:11.030 --> 04:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
in primary housing units
 
04:19:12.710 --> 04:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh they would be considered a holding
 
04:19:12.720 --> 04:19:14.090 align:start position:0%
uh they would be considered a holding
tank

04:19:14.090 --> 04:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
tank
 
04:19:16.189 --> 04:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
uh and the reason we don't allow for
 
04:19:18.650 --> 04:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
holding tanks is quite frankly the cost
 
04:19:21.710 --> 04:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
of Wastewater disposal
 
04:19:23.650 --> 04:19:23.660 align:start position:0%
becomes very
 
04:19:26.450 --> 04:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
problematic very quickly
 
04:19:29.570 --> 04:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
and we've we find that Wastewater is
 
04:19:34.130 --> 04:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
disposed of in illegal ways to try to
 
04:19:36.590 --> 04:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
get away from those those high costs of
 
04:19:36.600 --> 04:19:37.969 align:start position:0%
get away from those those high costs of
of

04:19:37.969 --> 04:19:37.979 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:19:41.389 --> 04:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
substance disposal here I'd also like to
 
04:19:44.990 --> 04:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
preface this with we're only referring
 
04:19:47.510 --> 04:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
to those tiny houses that would not be
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
on public water and sewer
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh obviously if a house is connected to
 
04:19:55.250 --> 04:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
Public Water and Sewer then those those
 
04:19:58.670 --> 04:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
individual disposal costs may not be
 
04:20:00.650 --> 04:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
incurred by the property owners
 
04:20:03.490 --> 04:20:03.500 align:start position:0%
we also have concerns regarding
 
04:20:07.309 --> 04:20:07.319 align:start position:0%
lot loading which in layman's terms is
 
04:20:09.710 --> 04:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
the ability of a particular piece of
 
04:20:13.250 --> 04:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
property to support a sewage load
 
04:20:16.429 --> 04:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
uh so if you already have a
 
04:20:19.010 --> 04:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
for example a four bedroom home on a
 
04:20:21.110 --> 04:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
property and you bring in a tiny home
 
04:20:23.330 --> 04:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
that's additional Wastewater loading
 
04:20:25.550 --> 04:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
that that lot has to support
 
04:20:27.889 --> 04:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
and depending on the size of the lot and
 
04:20:30.229 --> 04:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
the lot characteristics you know soil
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
types Etc uh that lot may not be able to
 
04:20:38.210 --> 04:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
support that additional sewage load and
 
04:20:40.370 --> 04:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
that again would be in
 
04:20:46.309 --> 04:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:48.889 --> 04:20:48.899 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try to be brief on the
 
04:20:51.830 --> 04:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
times here the other part of the bill is
 
04:20:55.790 --> 04:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
relative to tiny home parks and I
 
04:20:58.550 --> 04:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
believe and I I'm sorry but I didn't see
 
04:21:02.030 --> 04:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the bill but in our
 
04:21:03.889 --> 04:21:03.899 align:start position:0%
letter of testimony we recommend some
 
04:21:06.110 --> 04:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
language regarding to tiny home parks
 
04:21:09.769 --> 04:21:09.779 align:start position:0%
and it would basically bring the parks
 
04:21:11.870 --> 04:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
into the same type of regulations as we
 
04:21:15.590 --> 04:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
have for existing mobile home parks uh
 
04:21:17.330 --> 04:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
and again the bill may have been amended
 
04:21:17.340 --> 04:21:18.650 align:start position:0%
and again the bill may have been amended
to

04:21:18.650 --> 04:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:21:20.389 --> 04:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
to accommodate for those those
 
04:21:20.399 --> 04:21:23.450 align:start position:0%
to accommodate for those those
regulations

04:21:23.450 --> 04:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:25.269 --> 04:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
if I could just
 
04:21:28.250 --> 04:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh you know all other forms of housing
 
04:21:30.769 --> 04:21:30.779 align:start position:0%
require again if they're not on public
 
04:21:35.570 --> 04:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
water or sewer uh require some sort of
 
04:21:38.510 --> 04:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
compliant septic system uh and as Mr
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
Mandola referred to he was asking that
 
04:21:43.689 --> 04:21:43.699 align:start position:0%
tiny homes be
 
04:21:46.429 --> 04:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
considered as similarly as every other
 
04:21:48.950 --> 04:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
form of Housing and I guess when I heard
 
04:21:51.050 --> 04:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
that I thought of the same thing you
 
04:21:53.889 --> 04:21:53.899 align:start position:0%
know the Department's looking to have
 
04:21:57.429 --> 04:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
Wastewater disposal uh
 
04:21:59.450 --> 04:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
requirements the same as every other
 
04:22:01.010 --> 04:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
form of housing in the state of New
 
04:22:03.550 --> 04:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and not to
 
04:22:05.929 --> 04:22:05.939 align:start position:0%
allow for
 
04:22:08.570 --> 04:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
this type of home to be
 
04:22:11.570 --> 04:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
different or somehow differentiated from
 
04:22:14.090 --> 04:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
that of a a two-bedroom mobile home or
 
04:22:16.729 --> 04:22:16.739 align:start position:0%
quite frankly a six bedroom stick built
 
04:22:16.739 --> 04:22:17.389 align:start position:0%
quite frankly a six bedroom stick built
home

04:22:17.389 --> 04:22:17.399 align:start position:0%

at that and I'd be happy to answer some
 
04:22:32.269 --> 04:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
questions if anybody has any questions

for me thank you Mr tariff are there any
 
04:22:38.269 --> 04:22:38.279 align:start position:0%

and representative power
 
04:22:50.750 --> 04:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
um and thank you Mr tarda for being here
 
04:22:53.269 --> 04:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
I know of a few homeowners associations
 
04:22:55.150 --> 04:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:22:57.830 --> 04:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
southern part of New Hampshire here that
 
04:23:01.370 --> 04:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
have a community water and Community
 
04:23:04.790 --> 04:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
septic system is that something that you
 
04:23:08.330 --> 04:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
see as viable or even possible for a
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
tiny Home Project that's not uh in a
 
04:23:17.150 --> 04:23:17.160 align:start position:0%

04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely I mean there are there are
 
04:23:23.510 --> 04:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
many community
 
04:23:25.969 --> 04:23:25.979 align:start position:0%
on-site Wastewater systems you know
 
04:23:28.250 --> 04:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
again it's it's not even for smaller
 
04:23:31.550 --> 04:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
homes you could have uh an association
 
04:23:31.560 --> 04:23:32.630 align:start position:0%
homes you could have uh an association
of

04:23:32.630 --> 04:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:23:35.030 --> 04:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
four bedroom homes that have a community
 
04:23:37.130 --> 04:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
system associated with the Wastewater
 
04:23:39.830 --> 04:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
disposal it's it's really a matter of
 
04:23:42.349 --> 04:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
again I threw out the term earlier lot
 
04:23:45.290 --> 04:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
loading and and we look at a particular
 
04:23:47.030 --> 04:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
piece of property in the characteristics
 
04:23:49.490 --> 04:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
of that property to be able to support
 
04:23:55.870 --> 04:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:57.950 --> 04:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
I was just going to finish with those
 
04:24:02.570 --> 04:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
types of systems typically uh the all of
 
04:24:04.250 --> 04:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
the Lots combined
 
04:24:07.370 --> 04:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
or well depending on depending on the
 
04:24:09.650 --> 04:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
scenario the lot that you that the
 
04:24:11.689 --> 04:24:11.699 align:start position:0%
septic system or the leech field is
 
04:24:11.699 --> 04:24:12.769 align:start position:0%
septic system or the leech field is
located

04:24:12.769 --> 04:24:12.779 align:start position:0%
located
 
04:24:15.229 --> 04:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
needs to be able to support the load for
 
04:24:17.990 --> 04:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
that entire Wastewater you know and we
 
04:24:20.150 --> 04:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
do it on typically we do it on number of
 
04:24:22.490 --> 04:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
bedrooms for residential applications so
 
04:24:25.610 --> 04:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
if you have 20 bedrooms combined
 
04:24:28.370 --> 04:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
the the property that the the system
 
04:24:29.929 --> 04:24:29.939 align:start position:0%
itself is located must be able to
 
04:24:31.870 --> 04:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
support that
 
04:24:34.490 --> 04:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
and we do without getting into too many
 
04:24:36.170 --> 04:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
details we get into easements and things
 
04:24:37.610 --> 04:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
like that as well to accommodate for
 
04:24:39.290 --> 04:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
those flows
 
04:24:41.389 --> 04:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
got it and may I have a follow-up Mr
 
04:24:43.969 --> 04:24:43.979 align:start position:0%
chair uh one brief follow-up we are
 
04:24:45.650 --> 04:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
running way behind and I want to give
 
04:24:47.110 --> 04:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
everybody lunch here
 
04:24:50.150 --> 04:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry semester chart if this
 
04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
may or may not be your uh expertise but
 
04:24:55.969 --> 04:24:55.979 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering because I know from my
 
04:24:58.490 --> 04:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
practice of selling real estate that if
 
04:25:00.830 --> 04:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
a community has a community well that
 
04:25:02.990 --> 04:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
well needs to be tested every six months
 
04:25:04.969 --> 04:25:04.979 align:start position:0%
am I correct
 
04:25:06.830 --> 04:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
I'll be you are correct and that's not
 
04:25:10.130 --> 04:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
my area of expertise Wells need to be
 
04:25:13.309 --> 04:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
tested the frequency I I would I can't
 
04:25:14.990 --> 04:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
really speak to him I'm sorry oh
 
04:25:16.729 --> 04:25:16.739 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine I'll figure figured out
 
04:25:18.650 --> 04:25:18.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr Charter
 
04:25:20.689 --> 04:25:20.699 align:start position:0%

04:25:27.710 --> 04:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
testimony to three minutes okay and I'm

members my name is Michelle Sanborn I'm
 
04:26:00.649 --> 04:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
a resident of Alexandria New Hampshire
 
04:26:01.969 --> 04:26:01.979 align:start position:0%
and I've been a resident of New
 
04:26:04.550 --> 04:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for well over 30 years I am
 
04:26:06.530 --> 04:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
currently living in a tiny home on
 
04:26:06.540 --> 04:26:08.630 align:start position:0%
currently living in a tiny home on
wheels

04:26:08.630 --> 04:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
wheels
 
04:26:11.330 --> 04:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
um this is not just uh an affordable
 
04:26:14.030 --> 04:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
housing issue for Millennials I am in my
 
04:26:18.050 --> 04:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
50s I am a new divorcee and considering
 
04:26:21.530 --> 04:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
uh the affordable housing issue with uh
 
04:26:23.630 --> 04:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
the number of out-of-state people moving
 
04:26:25.849 --> 04:26:25.859 align:start position:0%
into the state
 
04:26:28.849 --> 04:26:28.859 align:start position:0%
I can definitely not afford to buy a
 
04:26:31.849 --> 04:26:31.859 align:start position:0%
home not even a small home
 
04:26:34.429 --> 04:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
um so a tiny home on Wheels is something
 
04:26:36.649 --> 04:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
that that I can't afford it puts a roof
 
04:26:39.649 --> 04:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
over my head uh the problem I'm running
 
04:26:39.659 --> 04:26:40.849 align:start position:0%
over my head uh the problem I'm running
into

04:26:40.849 --> 04:26:40.859 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
and I have no issues with uh with the
 
04:26:46.189 --> 04:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
waste water any of that um Alexandria is
 
04:26:48.050 --> 04:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
pretty rural everybody's on a septic
 
04:26:50.090 --> 04:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
everybody has a private well that makes
 
04:26:53.210 --> 04:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
complete and total sense my tiny home is
 
04:26:55.250 --> 04:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
not self-contained so of course it's
 
04:26:58.370 --> 04:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
going to make sense to to use a um
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
septic system and viable you know water
 
04:27:01.439 --> 04:27:03.290 align:start position:0%
septic system and viable you know water
source

04:27:03.290 --> 04:27:03.300 align:start position:0%
source
 
04:27:07.610 --> 04:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
um but this issue of uh being forced to
 
04:27:09.229 --> 04:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
to remove
 
04:27:10.729 --> 04:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
um to have this on a permanent
 
04:27:10.739 --> 04:27:12.229 align:start position:0%
um to have this on a permanent
foundation

04:27:12.229 --> 04:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
foundation
 
04:27:14.809 --> 04:27:14.819 align:start position:0%
is is okay
 
04:27:16.790 --> 04:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
um so long as the tiny home can be
 
04:27:19.910 --> 04:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
simply like put up on blocks
 
04:27:21.530 --> 04:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
um but what I keep running into is I
 
04:27:24.649 --> 04:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
cannot even buy property Alexandria does
 
04:27:26.510 --> 04:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
not have zoning so you would think it
 
04:27:29.630 --> 04:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
would be tiny home friendly but I'm
 
04:27:32.030 --> 04:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
running into subdivision restrictions on
 
04:27:34.130 --> 04:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
mobile homes since there is no tiny home
 
04:27:36.830 --> 04:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
definition they use their discretion and
 
04:27:38.630 --> 04:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
say oh no that's a mobile home you can't
 
04:27:41.689 --> 04:27:41.699 align:start position:0%
have that here if I go to there's a
 
04:27:44.450 --> 04:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
warranty deed restriction that I keep
 
04:27:46.130 --> 04:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
running up against
 
04:27:48.349 --> 04:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
um for mobile homes and again they're
 
04:27:50.570 --> 04:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
using their discretion and saying that a
 
04:27:52.250 --> 04:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
tiny home is a mobile home and therefore
 
04:27:55.309 --> 04:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
they don't want it so having I'm usually
 
04:27:57.830 --> 04:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
one who is very anti-state preemption
 
04:27:59.929 --> 04:27:59.939 align:start position:0%
because it generally
 
04:28:02.330 --> 04:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
um does not allow local communities to
 
04:28:05.149 --> 04:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
set more protective measures but in this
 
04:28:07.370 --> 04:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
case I would see a state preemptive
 
04:28:10.969 --> 04:28:10.979 align:start position:0%
mandatory allowing tiny homes Statewide
 
04:28:13.210 --> 04:28:13.220 align:start position:0%
as a minimum
 
04:28:16.309 --> 04:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
acceptance level to allow for affordable
 
04:28:16.319 --> 04:28:18.050 align:start position:0%
acceptance level to allow for affordable
housing

04:28:18.050 --> 04:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:28:20.510 --> 04:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
um sometimes it's a town zoning that is
 
04:28:23.149 --> 04:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
an issue but like I said even in my own
 
04:28:23.159 --> 04:28:24.530 align:start position:0%
an issue but like I said even in my own
town

04:28:24.530 --> 04:28:24.540 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:28:26.210 --> 04:28:26.220 align:start position:0%
um I'm running into issues of not even
 
04:28:28.010 --> 04:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
being able to buy properties so I'm
 
04:28:29.510 --> 04:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
actually considering moving to Vermont
 
04:28:31.550 --> 04:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh because they are more tiny home
 
04:28:33.769 --> 04:28:33.779 align:start position:0%
friendly all around whether it's just
 
04:28:35.570 --> 04:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
buying and owning a piece of property
 
04:28:38.389 --> 04:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
outright whether it's a tiny home
 
04:28:40.790 --> 04:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
Community I looked into trying to find a
 
04:28:42.110 --> 04:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
tiny home community in New Hampshire
 
04:28:44.389 --> 04:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
they don't exist
 
04:28:46.849 --> 04:28:46.859 align:start position:0%
um so I can't go there I can't buy
 
04:28:50.090 --> 04:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
property it's very frustrating and I'm
 
04:28:52.729 --> 04:28:52.739 align:start position:0%
actually being disenfranchised and I
 
04:28:54.590 --> 04:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
feel like I'm being evicted out of my
 
04:28:57.469 --> 04:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
own State and it really is an affordable
 
04:28:59.750 --> 04:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
housing issue
 
04:29:01.250 --> 04:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
um I think those are the main things
 
04:29:04.550 --> 04:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
this this aspect of removing the tiny
 
04:29:06.110 --> 04:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
home on Wheels I feel is a little bit
 
04:29:07.849 --> 04:29:07.859 align:start position:0%
problematic because I don't understand
 
04:29:10.429 --> 04:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
that meaning does this mean that tiny
 
04:29:12.290 --> 04:29:12.300 align:start position:0%
home on wheels are not going to be
 
04:29:14.149 --> 04:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
covered under this you know protective
 
04:29:17.389 --> 04:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
definition measure and if that's the
 
04:29:21.349 --> 04:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
case then I'm just completely doomed I
 
04:29:23.269 --> 04:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
will literally become homeless and be on
 
04:29:25.070 --> 04:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
the streets which is not something any
 
04:29:27.889 --> 04:29:27.899 align:start position:0%
state wants that's not helping the
 
04:29:32.269 --> 04:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
financial uh viability of of myself as a
 
04:29:35.450 --> 04:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
contributing Citizen and it's also not
 
04:29:37.010 --> 04:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
helping the state
 
04:29:39.050 --> 04:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
so I do have a question around that what
 
04:29:41.570 --> 04:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
does that mean that this section of tiny
 
04:29:43.670 --> 04:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
home on Wheels is being removed does it
 
04:29:46.189 --> 04:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
just mean that when I if if and when I
 
04:29:47.990 --> 04:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
can find property that I just have to
 
04:29:50.330 --> 04:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
take my wheels off if that's the case
 
04:29:52.670 --> 04:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with that
 
04:29:55.250 --> 04:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
um but if it means that I cannot bring
 
04:29:57.530 --> 04:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
in a tiny home on Wheels that's going to
 
04:29:59.929 --> 04:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
be a problem because it grossly
 
04:30:02.330 --> 04:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
increases the cost of getting this up on
 
04:30:04.490 --> 04:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
a flatbed or whatever and paying a
 
04:30:07.490 --> 04:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
commercial you know Transport company
 
04:30:10.010 --> 04:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to respond to to any
 
04:30:10.020 --> 04:30:11.389 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to respond to to any
questions

04:30:11.389 --> 04:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:30:11.399 --> 04:30:11.990 align:start position:0%
questions
um

04:30:11.990 --> 04:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:14.750 --> 04:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
but that's my my brief testimony so I'm
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
not sure that I'm fully in favor of this
 
04:30:18.290 --> 04:30:18.300 align:start position:0%
bill I am definitely in favor of
 
04:30:20.750 --> 04:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
defining tiny homes so Statewide
 
04:30:20.760 --> 04:30:22.550 align:start position:0%
defining tiny homes so Statewide
preemption

04:30:22.550 --> 04:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
preemption
 
04:30:24.229 --> 04:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
um that allows for tiny homes anywhere
 
04:30:26.990 --> 04:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
single residential home is and I totally
 
04:30:29.630 --> 04:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
agree with tiny home communities falling
 
04:30:31.490 --> 04:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
under similar guidelines to mobile home
 
04:30:31.500 --> 04:30:36.710 align:start position:0%
under similar guidelines to mobile home
parks

04:30:36.710 --> 04:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:38.450 --> 04:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
um are there any questions for this
 
04:30:41.570 --> 04:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
witness Mr chair presently I do not see
 
04:30:43.429 --> 04:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
any committee numbers with their hands
 
04:30:43.439 --> 04:30:44.570 align:start position:0%
any committee numbers with their hands
raised

04:30:44.570 --> 04:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
raised
 
04:30:46.969 --> 04:30:46.979 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much and the next
 
04:30:51.050 --> 04:30:51.060 align:start position:0%
person to testify will be Alex Kish
 
04:31:05.050 --> 04:31:05.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:08.809 --> 04:31:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:10.969 --> 04:31:10.979 align:start position:0%
you can hear me I I don't know I'm in
 
04:31:14.269 --> 04:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
the barn I'm in the dark here yeah
 
04:31:16.189 --> 04:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
okay good I have prepared statement but
 
04:31:17.990 --> 04:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
I just want to go and respond to some of
 
04:31:19.550 --> 04:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
the things that have come up on the Fly
 
04:31:21.830 --> 04:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
here number one it's not just the
 
04:31:23.630 --> 04:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
affordable Workforce housing we're
 
04:31:25.790 --> 04:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
talking about for Millennials I'm I'm an
 
04:31:28.790 --> 04:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
old guy and you know it applies to me
 
04:31:30.170 --> 04:31:30.180 align:start position:0%
and we just heard from the divorced
 
04:31:31.910 --> 04:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
woman so it's a broad spectrum of people
 
04:31:33.889 --> 04:31:33.899 align:start position:0%
that this apply to and I think it's very
 
04:31:36.170 --> 04:31:36.180 align:start position:0%
important to adopt
 
04:31:39.469 --> 04:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
uh I've been a resident of New Hampshire
 
04:31:42.229 --> 04:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
since 1996.
 
04:31:42.239 --> 04:31:43.370 align:start position:0%
since 1996.
um

04:31:43.370 --> 04:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:46.070 --> 04:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately is that true that
 
04:31:47.689 --> 04:31:47.699 align:start position:0%
local zoning has not stepped up
 
04:31:47.699 --> 04:31:49.790 align:start position:0%
local zoning has not stepped up
accommodated

04:31:49.790 --> 04:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
accommodated
 
04:31:51.530 --> 04:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
um the tiny homes
 
04:31:53.510 --> 04:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
and I own property in three different
 
04:31:58.189 --> 04:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
towns so I'm pretty sure that that's a
 
04:32:01.250 --> 04:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
fairly accurate statement Statewide so I
 
04:32:01.260 --> 04:32:02.689 align:start position:0%
fairly accurate statement Statewide so I
unlike

04:32:02.689 --> 04:32:02.699 align:start position:0%
unlike
 
04:32:05.389 --> 04:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
um one of the other
 
04:32:07.490 --> 04:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
um people who've testified I think that
 
04:32:09.590 --> 04:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
the state needs to push this so that the
 
04:32:13.490 --> 04:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:16.550 --> 04:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
you know they'll have to do something to
 
04:32:20.689 --> 04:32:20.699 align:start position:0%
adopt and dress it outright and
 
04:32:23.630 --> 04:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
furthermore zoning should not regulate
 
04:32:25.550 --> 04:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
the form of housing to second-class
 
04:32:25.560 --> 04:32:26.630 align:start position:0%
the form of housing to second-class
status

04:32:26.630 --> 04:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
status
 
04:32:29.330 --> 04:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
as only an Adu or accessory dwelling
 
04:32:32.030 --> 04:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
unit or to be confined to small and
 
04:32:34.610 --> 04:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
cramped Parts they deserve there and to
 
04:32:36.649 --> 04:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
be accommodated outright and I think
 
04:32:38.689 --> 04:32:38.699 align:start position:0%
this bill does that so I think it's
 
04:32:42.889 --> 04:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
important enough to just on that alone
 
04:32:42.899 --> 04:32:43.849 align:start position:0%
important enough to just on that alone
um

04:32:43.849 --> 04:32:43.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:43.859 --> 04:32:45.290 align:start position:0%
um
now

04:32:45.290 --> 04:32:45.300 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:32:47.689 --> 04:32:47.699 align:start position:0%
I wasn't made aware that the on Wheels
 
04:32:50.210 --> 04:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
was removed from this I didn't see the
 
04:32:52.969 --> 04:32:52.979 align:start position:0%
amendment but I see no relation between
 
04:32:55.070 --> 04:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
relevant relation between a foundation
 
04:32:57.170 --> 04:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
and the overall structure this is more
 
04:32:57.180 --> 04:32:58.550 align:start position:0%
and the overall structure this is more
about

04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:11.109 --> 04:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:13.131 --> 04:33:13.141 align:start position:0%
got lost
 
04:33:15.470 --> 04:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
you want to be back yeah
 
04:33:17.390 --> 04:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
yeah it was
 
04:33:18.890 --> 04:33:18.900 align:start position:0%
I'm living out in the Boondocks
 
04:33:20.990 --> 04:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
apparently you uh disconnected me I just
 
04:33:22.310 --> 04:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
caught a couple more points if I'm still
 
04:33:22.320 --> 04:33:23.510 align:start position:0%
caught a couple more points if I'm still
here

04:33:23.510 --> 04:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:33:25.429 --> 04:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
um I believe in people's agency and
 
04:33:26.990 --> 04:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
their ability to decipher themselves how
 
04:33:28.369 --> 04:33:28.379 align:start position:0%
much space they require to meet their
 
04:33:28.379 --> 04:33:29.269 align:start position:0%
much space they require to meet their
needs

04:33:29.269 --> 04:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
needs
 
04:33:30.789 --> 04:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:33:34.369 --> 04:33:34.379 align:start position:0%
again the tiny homes often are not
 
04:33:36.830 --> 04:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
accommodated under zoning and because
 
04:33:39.170 --> 04:33:39.180 align:start position:0%
they are a lot less than 400 square feet
 
04:33:42.051 --> 04:33:42.061 align:start position:0%
finally I want to respond to Rob tired
 
04:33:43.789 --> 04:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
of my colleague over there at some
 
04:33:45.769 --> 04:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
service I'm a licensed septic designer
 
04:33:48.230 --> 04:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
and installer and additional real estate
 
04:33:48.240 --> 04:33:49.609 align:start position:0%
and installer and additional real estate
agent

04:33:49.609 --> 04:33:49.619 align:start position:0%
agent
 
04:33:52.010 --> 04:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
um I don't disagree with anything he
 
04:33:56.209 --> 04:33:56.219 align:start position:0%
said I would just add that I think the
 
04:33:58.070 --> 04:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
existing rules and regulations around
 
04:34:02.090 --> 04:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
septic systems already are adequate if
 
04:34:04.990 --> 04:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
anything I think um
 
04:34:07.429 --> 04:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
you know regulations regarding one
 
04:34:09.369 --> 04:34:09.379 align:start position:0%
bedroom septic designs
 
04:34:13.250 --> 04:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh being relaxed may be warranted
 
04:34:17.570 --> 04:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
uh but I think the rules as they stand
 
04:34:19.970 --> 04:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
already addressed
 
04:34:22.730 --> 04:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
um housing that tiny homes would fall
 
04:34:23.929 --> 04:34:23.939 align:start position:0%
under so
 
04:34:25.789 --> 04:34:25.799 align:start position:0%
there's that
 
04:34:28.910 --> 04:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
um and I think
 
04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
oh just one last thing real quick
 
04:34:34.609 --> 04:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
building standards exists I'm not sure
 
04:34:36.769 --> 04:34:36.779 align:start position:0%
and we've talked about the appendix Q
 
04:34:40.310 --> 04:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
being amended not familiar with that but
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
I do know that other states Florida
 
04:34:45.289 --> 04:34:45.299 align:start position:0%
Washington Oregon they've adopted these
 
04:34:49.369 --> 04:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
things and they work fine so I think at
 
04:34:50.631 --> 04:34:50.641 align:start position:0%
the very least New Hampshire could look
 
04:34:51.949 --> 04:34:51.959 align:start position:0%
to them
 
04:34:55.010 --> 04:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh for guidance if needed be anyway
 
04:34:58.429 --> 04:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time Mr chairman
 
04:35:00.650 --> 04:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
all right thank you testimony are there
 
04:35:03.109 --> 04:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
any questions for Mr Kish
 
04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I do not see any committee
 
04:35:08.510 --> 04:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
members with their hands rates okay I
 
04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:10.561 align:start position:0%
see nuns I would like to recognize
 
04:35:13.240 --> 04:35:13.250 align:start position:0%
Gerald Miller if he's on the line
 
04:35:13.250 --> 04:35:22.670 align:start position:0%
Gerald Miller if he's on the line
[Music]

04:35:22.670 --> 04:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:35.090 --> 04:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:38.810 --> 04:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
been asking him on mute
 
04:35:41.029 --> 04:35:41.039 align:start position:0%
it's not a response
 
04:35:42.910 --> 04:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
ah here we go
 
04:35:47.631 --> 04:35:47.641 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not familiar with uh Zoom to the
 
04:35:50.689 --> 04:35:50.699 align:start position:0%
point where I'm real comfortable but I
 
04:35:50.699 --> 04:35:52.570 align:start position:0%
point where I'm real comfortable but I
assume

04:35:52.570 --> 04:35:52.580 align:start position:0%
assume
 
04:35:55.369 --> 04:35:55.379 align:start position:0%
uh if you if you would like to give your
 
04:35:56.929 --> 04:35:56.939 align:start position:0%
testimony I would appreciate it and
 
04:35:59.869 --> 04:35:59.879 align:start position:0%
limit it for three minutes okay yes in
 
04:36:03.349 --> 04:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
fact uh I'm going to just have you
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
referred to the uh written testimony
 
04:36:10.150 --> 04:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
that I have sent in and I can limit it
 
04:36:15.769 --> 04:36:15.779 align:start position:0%
to uh just say that I'm in favor of the
 
04:36:19.730 --> 04:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
original bill and I understand the
 
04:36:23.510 --> 04:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
reasoning behind the amendment because
 
04:36:27.709 --> 04:36:27.719 align:start position:0%
uh I did attend most of the study
 
04:36:30.670 --> 04:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
committee uh meetings and participated
 
04:36:33.170 --> 04:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
along with
 
04:36:35.631 --> 04:36:35.641 align:start position:0%
um representative Maggiore and the
 
04:36:39.769 --> 04:36:39.779 align:start position:0%
others and I I know that that was a Hot
 
04:36:45.470 --> 04:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
Topic and I can also say that I feel
 
04:36:48.709 --> 04:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
sorry for the people who this will not
 
04:36:48.719 --> 04:36:50.330 align:start position:0%
sorry for the people who this will not
benefit

04:36:50.330 --> 04:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
04:36:55.029 --> 04:36:55.039 align:start position:0%
um but I also feel that we need this
 
04:36:59.209 --> 04:36:59.219 align:start position:0%
bill and legislation just to get tiny
 
04:37:04.429 --> 04:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
houses on the record in New Hampshire so
 
04:37:09.170 --> 04:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
that it is recognized as a
 
04:37:09.180 --> 04:37:09.709 align:start position:0%
that it is recognized as a
um

04:37:09.709 --> 04:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:13.929 --> 04:37:13.939 align:start position:0%
a type of dwelling that is uh
 
04:37:16.131 --> 04:37:16.141 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
04:37:20.810 --> 04:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
I think in the future uh more widespread
 
04:37:24.590 --> 04:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
because it's this type of living that
 
04:37:29.510 --> 04:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
young middle-aged and old people are
 
04:37:34.070 --> 04:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
really taken to heart for
 
04:37:37.070 --> 04:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
all the reasons that everybody has said
 
04:37:40.369 --> 04:37:40.379 align:start position:0%
so far so I will leave it at that and
 
04:37:42.830 --> 04:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
let you go forward and give me
 
04:37:44.449 --> 04:37:44.459 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Miller does
 
04:37:46.189 --> 04:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions from Mr
 
04:37:48.349 --> 04:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
Miller Mr chair I'd like to inform you
 
04:37:51.410 --> 04:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
that there are two attendees who have
 
04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
their hands raised one has already
 
04:37:57.590 --> 04:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
provided testimony in one I do not see
 
04:37:59.810 --> 04:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
on this list and I'm unclear as to
 
04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
whether that person could provide the
 
04:38:04.551 --> 04:38:04.561 align:start position:0%
testimony previously when I was not
 
04:38:09.349 --> 04:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:09.359 --> 04:38:11.570 align:start position:0%
 
rocks

04:38:11.570 --> 04:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
rocks
 
04:38:11.580 --> 04:38:13.510 align:start position:0%
rocks
recommendations

04:38:13.510 --> 04:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
04:38:19.970 --> 04:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:27.529 --> 04:38:27.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:29.631 --> 04:38:29.641 align:start position:0%
I am here and good afternoon Mr chairman
 
04:38:31.189 --> 04:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for recognizing me I
 
04:38:32.689 --> 04:38:32.699 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I had not intended to
 
04:38:34.429 --> 04:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
speak but um
 
04:38:37.849 --> 04:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
I I feel compelled for two reasons uh
 
04:38:41.209 --> 04:38:41.219 align:start position:0%
the first is yeah we're way behind and
 
04:38:43.429 --> 04:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
these guys are hungry uh I understand
 
04:38:46.970 --> 04:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
I'll be very brief thank you I uh the
 
04:38:49.789 --> 04:38:49.799 align:start position:0%
reasons I I feel compelled to speak uh
 
04:38:51.230 --> 04:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
and again Ben Frost from New Hampshire
 
04:38:53.269 --> 04:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
Housing Finance Authority
 
04:38:55.429 --> 04:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
um the two reasons I want to speak are
 
04:38:58.131 --> 04:38:58.141 align:start position:0%
one uh the amendment I think is an
 
04:39:00.230 --> 04:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
improvement of amendment proffered by
 
04:39:02.029 --> 04:39:02.039 align:start position:0%
representative Maggiore he was kind
 
04:39:03.230 --> 04:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
enough to send it to me that as
 
04:39:06.890 --> 04:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh zero five one zero H
 
04:39:09.289 --> 04:39:09.299 align:start position:0%
um and this the second reason is because
 
04:39:12.051 --> 04:39:12.061 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing was invoked uh by
 
04:39:14.689 --> 04:39:14.699 align:start position:0%
name by uh my friend Cordell Johnston so
 
04:39:18.230 --> 04:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
I do want to uh say that I think that
 
04:39:22.010 --> 04:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
um although he is correct that this
 
04:39:24.709 --> 04:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
legislation if enacted uh is amended or
 
04:39:27.470 --> 04:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
as introduced would not solve the
 
04:39:29.570 --> 04:39:29.580 align:start position:0%
state's affordable housing crisis
 
04:39:32.570 --> 04:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
it would certainly help and I think that
 
04:39:35.209 --> 04:39:35.219 align:start position:0%
anything that the legislature does that
 
04:39:37.670 --> 04:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
can improve the housing Supply in New
 
04:39:40.250 --> 04:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire especially of lower cost units
 
04:39:43.670 --> 04:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
would be of benefit to us as a state
 
04:39:46.850 --> 04:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
I do have my last comment is I do have a
 
04:39:49.310 --> 04:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
minor concern with regard to the
 
04:39:51.288 --> 04:39:51.298 align:start position:0%
language this is on the bill is
 
04:39:54.470 --> 04:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
introduced page one lines 26 through 31
 
04:39:57.770 --> 04:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
and in the amendment uh page one lines
 
04:40:01.368 --> 04:40:01.378 align:start position:0%
20 through 25 with regard to detached
 
04:40:03.230 --> 04:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units but I
 
04:40:04.610 --> 04:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
understand you're under time constraints
 
04:40:06.530 --> 04:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to work with the prime
 
04:40:09.830 --> 04:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor and representative majori to
 
04:40:12.530 --> 04:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
work on an amendment in the Senate if it
 
04:40:15.590 --> 04:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
gets there have to take any questions if
 
04:40:18.288 --> 04:40:18.298 align:start position:0%
that's acceptable to representative the
 
04:40:20.150 --> 04:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
jury that that would be great are there
 
04:40:22.788 --> 04:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
any questions for Mr Frost
 
04:40:25.430 --> 04:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I did not see any committee
 
04:40:28.310 --> 04:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:31.788 --> 04:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
raised on the attendee list and I don't
 
04:40:34.730 --> 04:40:34.740 align:start position:0%
see those names
 
04:40:37.750 --> 04:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
having been previously signed in
 
04:40:39.890 --> 04:40:39.900 align:start position:0%

um so there's a Ms Michelle Sanborn with
 
04:40:54.830 --> 04:40:54.840 align:start position:0%

I'd like everybody to know that there's
 
04:41:59.050 --> 04:41:59.060 align:start position:0%
a tool that we use
 
04:42:03.350 --> 04:42:03.360 align:start position:0%

04:42:05.330 --> 04:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
this meeting today
 
04:42:08.690 --> 04:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
um unaware of the amendment the um house
 
04:42:11.330 --> 04:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
bill that was introduced is there there
 
04:42:13.368 --> 04:42:13.378 align:start position:0%
are no amendments listed there as well
 
04:42:16.550 --> 04:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
so I was unaware that the tiny houses on
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
wheels was pulled from this original as
 
04:42:21.770 --> 04:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
introduced bill
 
04:42:24.830 --> 04:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
um but I just want to say uh I am in
 
04:42:26.750 --> 04:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
support of tiny homes
 
04:42:29.510 --> 04:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
um here in New Hampshire
 
04:42:31.250 --> 04:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
um it does absolutely provide the
 
04:42:34.250 --> 04:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
pathway to affordable housing and yes
 
04:42:36.288 --> 04:42:36.298 align:start position:0%
like others have said it's not just the
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
Millennials it's the students Workforce
 
04:42:41.330 --> 04:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
housing retirees wanting to downsize
 
04:42:44.050 --> 04:42:44.060 align:start position:0%
people like myself preparing to retire
 
04:42:46.970 --> 04:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
seniors and families that want to be
 
04:42:51.410 --> 04:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
closer you know in an Adu or a tiny home
 
04:42:54.410 --> 04:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
on Wheel situation on the same property
 
04:42:57.708 --> 04:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
as their personal needs change over time
 
04:43:00.708 --> 04:43:00.718 align:start position:0%

04:43:00.718 --> 04:43:02.230 align:start position:0%

bill

04:43:02.230 --> 04:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:43:04.850 --> 04:43:04.860 align:start position:0%
588 and um
 
04:43:08.810 --> 04:43:08.820 align:start position:0%
I do support it and I look forward to
 
04:43:11.628 --> 04:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
the future amendment to this bill I'm
 
04:43:13.550 --> 04:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
not really clear if it will be to this
 
04:43:16.510 --> 04:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
bill or if a new bill needs to be
 
04:43:19.610 --> 04:43:19.620 align:start position:0%
developed and introduced specifically to
 
04:43:23.230 --> 04:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
the tiny houses on wheels there are
 
04:43:26.090 --> 04:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
associations that have very successfully
 
04:43:28.310 --> 04:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
across the country worked with other
 
04:43:31.128 --> 04:43:31.138 align:start position:0%
states and municipalities and counties
 
04:43:34.310 --> 04:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
in legalizing tiny houses on wheels I'm
 
04:43:36.770 --> 04:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
certainly available for any questions
 
04:43:40.788 --> 04:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
and resources to get further assistance

beginning from from chair Dolan
 
04:46:52.490 --> 04:46:52.500 align:start position:0%

the exact session okay

understood but the exact section should
 
04:47:05.868 --> 04:47:05.878 align:start position:0%

[Music]

05:19:20.868 --> 05:19:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:20.878 --> 05:19:23.208 align:start position:0%
 
15.

05:19:23.208 --> 05:19:23.218 align:start position:0%

05:19:31.670 --> 05:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
reminding you that when you show up at
 
05:19:33.350 --> 05:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock and we're halfway done with
 
05:19:34.610 --> 05:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
the first ability and I say what
 
05:19:34.620 --> 05:19:35.330 align:start position:0%
the first ability and I say what
happened

05:19:35.330 --> 05:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
happened
 
05:19:37.250 --> 05:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm giving you another of mine at 8
 
05:19:50.628 --> 05:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:50.638 --> 05:19:51.770 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:19:51.770 --> 05:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:19:53.990 --> 05:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
um I just was
 
05:19:56.390 --> 05:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
got a debriefing on what happened after
 
05:20:00.910 --> 05:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
I left and I want to I want to uh
 
05:20:03.708 --> 05:20:03.718 align:start position:0%
make an adjustment to like one of the
 
05:20:05.990 --> 05:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
bills we were discussing or that you
 
05:20:08.390 --> 05:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
were discussing in my absence and I want
 
05:20:10.910 --> 05:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
to fix something uh
 
05:20:14.330 --> 05:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
House Bill 588 that's the tiny house
 
05:20:18.650 --> 05:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
bill uh that was recessed
 
05:20:21.590 --> 05:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh or I I don't think it was recess I
 
05:20:23.448 --> 05:20:23.458 align:start position:0%
think it was there was just a general
 
05:20:26.510 --> 05:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
agreement to stop and and do it on
 
05:20:30.350 --> 05:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
Monday instead and we haven't noticed
 
05:20:32.690 --> 05:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
that from Monday in the calendar
 
05:20:35.030 --> 05:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
so the proper way to do that
 
05:20:38.770 --> 05:20:38.780 align:start position:0%
would be to recess the bill
 
05:20:41.868 --> 05:20:41.878 align:start position:0%
and not just move it so I'm going to
 
05:20:44.570 --> 05:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
reopen the public hearing
 
05:20:44.580 --> 05:20:45.890 align:start position:0%
reopen the public hearing
for

05:20:45.890 --> 05:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:20:48.288 --> 05:20:48.298 align:start position:0%
588 and then I'm going to recess until
 
05:20:51.770 --> 05:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
Monday just to make sure that we don't
 
05:20:54.170 --> 05:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
run a foul of the of the notice
 
05:20:58.430 --> 05:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
requirements for the public that that we
 
05:21:00.948 --> 05:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
have normally normally what we would do
 
05:21:03.670 --> 05:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
is we would republish it in the calendar
 
05:21:07.310 --> 05:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh and uh and re-notice it
 
05:21:10.430 --> 05:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
so we have a technique called resets and
 
05:21:12.650 --> 05:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
we can recess it and and continue
 
05:21:14.810 --> 05:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
discussing it in our next meeting which
 
05:21:17.390 --> 05:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
what I like to do so I'm going to reopen
 
05:21:19.070 --> 05:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
05:21:21.948 --> 05:21:21.958 align:start position:0%
or 588
 
05:21:24.530 --> 05:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
which is the building codes for tiny
 
05:21:27.288 --> 05:21:27.298 align:start position:0%
houses and unless I hear an objection
 
05:21:30.288 --> 05:21:30.298 align:start position:0%
I'm going to recess further discussion
 
05:21:32.390 --> 05:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
on that hearing
 
05:21:34.490 --> 05:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh until Monday
 
05:21:37.430 --> 05:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
in our meeting on the 8th yeah Mr chair
 
05:21:39.288 --> 05:21:39.298 align:start position:0%

beginning at 8 30. yes uh representative
 
05:21:43.730 --> 05:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
majority would it be inappropriate to

ask you to move that now unanimously
 
05:21:47.750 --> 05:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
ought to pass would that be
 
05:21:47.760 --> 05:21:49.310 align:start position:0%
ought to pass would that be
inappropriate

05:21:49.310 --> 05:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
05:21:52.850 --> 05:21:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:56.448 --> 05:21:56.458 align:start position:0%

05:23:04.670 --> 05:23:04.680 align:start position:0%

relative to the deadline to submit
 
05:23:19.850 --> 05:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
requests to restore involuntary Lots
 
05:23:24.010 --> 05:23:24.020 align:start position:0%
merge Lots is repealed basically
 
05:23:27.708 --> 05:23:27.718 align:start position:0%
it says is that we are we're removing
 
05:23:30.410 --> 05:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
the sunset Clause so it never sunsets
 
05:23:33.530 --> 05:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
you can apply at any time to have an

involuntarily merged lot unmerged
 
05:23:41.868 --> 05:23:41.878 align:start position:0%
so in the van I looked for you to make a
 
05:23:44.150 --> 05:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
motion on the amendment
 
05:23:47.708 --> 05:23:47.718 align:start position:0%
sure I move that we adopt the amendment
 
05:23:52.868 --> 05:23:52.878 align:start position:0%
for HB 284 as just read by the chairman
 
05:23:56.990 --> 05:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh chairman Dolan yes and let me add for
 
05:24:03.610 --> 05:24:03.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:06.770 --> 05:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
2021-05698 it's in hotel
 
05:24:12.288 --> 05:24:12.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:15.230 --> 05:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
pass on the bill first and then amend it
 
05:24:17.510 --> 05:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
I think that's the process
 
05:24:19.510 --> 05:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
but I'm
 
05:24:22.150 --> 05:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
am I wrong
 
05:24:26.030 --> 05:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
the way we had done it last year so
 
05:24:29.330 --> 05:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I I I don't think it matters I
 
05:24:31.128 --> 05:24:31.138 align:start position:0%
think that the only time that we get in
 
05:24:33.288 --> 05:24:33.298 align:start position:0%
trouble is if we're gonna I if we intend
 
05:24:35.510 --> 05:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
itl something and try to push an
 
05:24:37.788 --> 05:24:37.798 align:start position:0%
amendment through that that kind of is
 
05:24:40.910 --> 05:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
oil and and water okay fine I think it
 
05:24:43.368 --> 05:24:43.378 align:start position:0%
works either way okay
 
05:24:44.448 --> 05:24:44.458 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
05:24:49.730 --> 05:24:49.740 align:start position:0%

05:24:50.868 --> 05:24:50.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:24:52.128 --> 05:24:52.138 align:start position:0%

uh is there any discussion on the

uh otcs and then
 
05:32:58.788 --> 05:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
see none Mr Cliff would you take a roll
 
05:33:01.368 --> 05:33:01.378 align:start position:0%
call vote please
 
05:33:01.378 --> 05:33:10.850 align:start position:0%
call vote please
foreign

05:33:10.850 --> 05:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:13.190 --> 05:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't this the one that was going to be
 
05:33:15.470 --> 05:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
combined with the other two and an
 
05:33:18.170 --> 05:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
amendment would be offered yes this this
 
05:33:20.448 --> 05:33:20.458 align:start position:0%
we're recording on now we just voted on
 
05:33:23.030 --> 05:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment and when I were voting on
 
05:33:25.010 --> 05:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
the bill as amended
 
05:33:27.708 --> 05:33:27.718 align:start position:0%
and I suspect there will be two
 
05:33:29.930 --> 05:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
subsequent motions to itl the other two
 
05:33:31.670 --> 05:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
bills that's what I suspect is going to
 
05:33:33.890 --> 05:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
happen okay thank you
 
05:33:37.610 --> 05:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
so this is this is 243 as amended
 
05:33:39.770 --> 05:33:39.780 align:start position:0%
excuse me Mr chair I I see that
 
05:33:41.810 --> 05:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
representative Colleen has her hand
 
05:33:42.770 --> 05:33:42.780 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:33:45.410 --> 05:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
okay now typically what we do is we'll
 
05:33:47.690 --> 05:33:47.700 align:start position:0%
take a boat and then we'll I'll ask for
 
05:33:50.330 --> 05:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
for discussion but we've already asked
 
05:33:53.030 --> 05:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
the discussion so I'll I will deviate
 
05:33:54.948 --> 05:33:54.958 align:start position:0%
from that representative plea you had a
 
05:33:56.690 --> 05:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
quick comment
 
05:33:56.700 --> 05:33:57.310 align:start position:0%
quick comment
s

05:33:57.310 --> 05:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
s
 
05:33:59.750 --> 05:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
so this is unusual
 
05:34:02.868 --> 05:34:02.878 align:start position:0%
well I I apologize I I know we we
 
05:34:05.030 --> 05:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
already voted on the amendment and we're
 
05:34:07.250 --> 05:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
voting on OTP
 
05:34:10.788 --> 05:34:10.798 align:start position:0%
as amended yeah I I did have a question
 
05:34:12.890 --> 05:34:12.900 align:start position:0%
is is
 
05:34:15.590 --> 05:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
um I mentioned at the public hearing on
 
05:34:17.570 --> 05:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
this bill but if it's too late I
 
05:34:19.368 --> 05:34:19.378 align:start position:0%
completely understand
 
05:34:21.770 --> 05:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
well if you had something that you
 
05:34:24.288 --> 05:34:24.298 align:start position:0%
thought would be clarifying I'll I will
 
05:34:27.050 --> 05:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
suspend that rule for for you
 
05:34:30.350 --> 05:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
I I I truly appreciate that Mr chair
 
05:34:33.410 --> 05:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
um my my comments are or my question I
 
05:34:37.310 --> 05:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
guess for clarification is on the um
 
05:34:40.610 --> 05:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
the the 30 days I and I know that I
 
05:34:41.628 --> 05:34:41.638 align:start position:0%
probably should have mentioned that
 
05:34:43.788 --> 05:34:43.798 align:start position:0%
during the amendment but I I just
 
05:34:45.708 --> 05:34:45.718 align:start position:0%
figured that it would become part of the
 
05:34:47.930 --> 05:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
the entire bill and it's its entirety so
 
05:34:47.940 --> 05:34:48.770 align:start position:0%
the entire bill and it's its entirety so
again

05:34:48.770 --> 05:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:34:50.810 --> 05:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
truly my apologies and if you feel it's
 
05:34:52.430 --> 05:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
not appropriate
 
05:34:55.970 --> 05:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
um my concern about the 30 days
 
05:34:58.310 --> 05:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
um for prior to the public hearing and
 
05:34:59.930 --> 05:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
so on
 
05:35:02.270 --> 05:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
um I believe Mr Johnson brought up the
 
05:35:05.208 --> 05:35:05.218 align:start position:0%
the fact that um this was not
 
05:35:07.610 --> 05:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
necessarily that this had to be
 
05:35:10.430 --> 05:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
available to the public within 30 days
 
05:35:12.948 --> 05:35:12.958 align:start position:0%
before but to the the voting members of
 
05:35:14.390 --> 05:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
the of the budget committee or the
 
05:35:17.150 --> 05:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
school board or the selectment ETC I
 
05:35:19.490 --> 05:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify that particular
 
05:35:21.650 --> 05:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
thing and
 
05:35:24.530 --> 05:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
um the the changes in making all
 
05:35:27.230 --> 05:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
versions available within five days of
 
05:35:31.490 --> 05:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
any change also uh a confusing aspect
 
05:35:33.470 --> 05:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
um for me
 
05:35:36.350 --> 05:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
um so so I I apologize I really should
 
05:35:38.208 --> 05:35:38.218 align:start position:0%
have brought it up before this amendment
 
05:35:38.218 --> 05:35:39.170 align:start position:0%
have brought it up before this amendment
but

05:35:39.170 --> 05:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:35:39.180 --> 05:35:39.830 align:start position:0%
but
um

05:35:39.830 --> 05:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:42.288 --> 05:35:42.298 align:start position:0%
again if it's inappropriate now I
 
05:35:44.628 --> 05:35:44.638 align:start position:0%
completely understand I just could
 
05:35:47.330 --> 05:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
concerned about all these versions do we
 
05:35:49.368 --> 05:35:49.378 align:start position:0%
understand what we're voting on so I you
 
05:35:51.288 --> 05:35:51.298 align:start position:0%
know I'm I'm a little more flexible in
 
05:35:54.288 --> 05:35:54.298 align:start position:0%
that regard uh and let me ask uh
 
05:35:56.330 --> 05:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative giamonte who was very
 
05:35:59.868 --> 05:35:59.878 align:start position:0%
close to the originating uh this let me
 
05:36:02.270 --> 05:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
ask if he could give some clarification
 
05:36:06.110 --> 05:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
yeah on on the 30 days this is basically
 
05:36:09.350 --> 05:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
what happens is is a lot of these uh
 
05:36:10.970 --> 05:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
budget committees in the school
 
05:36:14.050 --> 05:36:14.060 align:start position:0%
especially uh they drag their feet
 
05:36:18.230 --> 05:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
and they the time limit is is extremely
 
05:36:21.288 --> 05:36:21.298 align:start position:0%
short that they give to to pass this
 
05:36:25.070 --> 05:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
budget and uh it goes right to you
 
05:36:27.830 --> 05:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
saying okay here it is and let's rub a
 
05:36:30.128 --> 05:36:30.138 align:start position:0%
stamp this and pass it along
 
05:36:32.448 --> 05:36:32.458 align:start position:0%
I think they should be held accountable
 
05:36:37.610 --> 05:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
and and get this uh get this accordingly
 
05:36:38.650 --> 05:36:38.660 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:36:42.670 --> 05:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
get it out earlier I mean there's no no
 
05:36:45.170 --> 05:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason for it other than
 
05:36:47.448 --> 05:36:47.458 align:start position:0%
stalling the budget I believe okay
 
05:36:49.190 --> 05:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative Porter you had also a
 
05:36:49.200 --> 05:36:54.128 align:start position:0%
representative Porter you had also a
question

05:36:54.128 --> 05:36:54.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:58.128 --> 05:36:58.138 align:start position:0%
to representative Piemonte
 
05:37:02.208 --> 05:37:02.218 align:start position:0%
um uh again uh thank you and and I my my
 
05:37:06.170 --> 05:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
concern is um that while this is perhaps
 
05:37:07.970 --> 05:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
aimed at school budgets and so on what
 
05:37:10.368 --> 05:37:10.378 align:start position:0%
about the municipal budget I know Town
 
05:37:11.690 --> 05:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
budgets work a little different than
 
05:37:14.690 --> 05:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
Municipal so for instance here in um
 
05:37:16.430 --> 05:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
Nashville we've
 
05:37:17.690 --> 05:37:17.700 align:start position:0%
um delayed
 
05:37:20.628 --> 05:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
putting out the budget because of covid
 
05:37:23.810 --> 05:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
and and so on um and usually it's
 
05:37:26.810 --> 05:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
released a lot earlier our budget as a
 
05:37:29.510 --> 05:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
whole will won't be out until probably
 
05:37:32.330 --> 05:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
like May and if we have to wait 30 days
 
05:37:34.010 --> 05:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
before we can have the public hearing it
 
05:37:36.110 --> 05:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
just becomes more delayed
 
05:37:38.810 --> 05:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
um Etc and where we work with a budget
 
05:37:41.990 --> 05:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee every department has their own
 
05:37:44.270 --> 05:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
budget it gets heard kind of gets
 
05:37:46.610 --> 05:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
amended would we have to put all of
 
05:37:49.128 --> 05:37:49.138 align:start position:0%
those versions up within five days and
 
05:37:50.690 --> 05:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
it's going to get really confusing on
 
05:37:52.550 --> 05:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
our website as to what is the current
 
05:37:55.128 --> 05:37:55.138 align:start position:0%
and and so on so I guess that's where
 
05:37:56.570 --> 05:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for clarification I'm sorry
 
05:37:58.550 --> 05:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
for so much specificity
 
05:38:01.670 --> 05:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh well let's see uh representative
 
05:38:02.810 --> 05:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
Porter do you have something you might
 
05:38:03.948 --> 05:38:03.958 align:start position:0%
want to add
 
05:38:06.650 --> 05:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
no I was just going to make a comment
 
05:38:08.208 --> 05:38:08.218 align:start position:0%
um about
 
05:38:10.368 --> 05:38:10.378 align:start position:0%
feet dragging
 
05:38:10.378 --> 05:38:11.090 align:start position:0%
feet dragging
um

05:38:11.090 --> 05:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:13.190 --> 05:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to remind the committee
 
05:38:13.200 --> 05:38:14.510 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to remind the committee
that

05:38:14.510 --> 05:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:38:16.610 --> 05:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
perhaps they're not aware that
 
05:38:19.970 --> 05:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
department heads in schools are teaching
 
05:38:22.490 --> 05:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
full-time during the day
 
05:38:25.550 --> 05:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
um and so doing the budget is another
 
05:38:28.868 --> 05:38:28.878 align:start position:0%
aspect over and above there
 
05:38:31.490 --> 05:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
duties to teach the children
 
05:38:33.948 --> 05:38:33.958 align:start position:0%
so what might seem like dragging feet
 
05:38:36.170 --> 05:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
might actually be not just not having
 
05:38:38.690 --> 05:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
enough time in the day to do what has
 
05:38:41.090 --> 05:38:41.100 align:start position:0%
been asked of them I and I would just
 
05:38:44.208 --> 05:38:44.218 align:start position:0%
like on the record so that that to that
 
05:38:46.730 --> 05:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
be on the record that there may be very
 
05:38:48.288 --> 05:38:48.298 align:start position:0%
legitimate reasons why it's difficult
 
05:38:51.470 --> 05:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
for Budget writers in the schools to get
 
05:38:54.530 --> 05:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
their budgets out the way people in the
 
05:38:57.070 --> 05:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
public might desire thank you
 
05:38:59.628 --> 05:38:59.638 align:start position:0%
representative could you make me a
 
05:38:59.638 --> 05:39:02.150 align:start position:0%
representative could you make me a
co-host

05:39:02.150 --> 05:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:07.250 --> 05:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:10.250 --> 05:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
okay so so we are in the voting mode uh
 
05:39:12.770 --> 05:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
what we just did was unusual and
 
05:39:15.890 --> 05:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
probably atypical but I felt it was
 
05:39:19.030 --> 05:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
important especially since uh
 
05:39:21.830 --> 05:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
this is a rather complex
 
05:39:24.530 --> 05:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
scenario that we have with we're doing a
 
05:39:27.350 --> 05:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
trifecta here all at once uh so I I
 
05:39:29.030 --> 05:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that we weren't
 
05:39:30.170 --> 05:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
doing something that we didn't
 
05:39:32.208 --> 05:39:32.218 align:start position:0%
completely all understand
 
05:39:36.230 --> 05:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh so I want to pick up what we left off
 
05:39:38.570 --> 05:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
representative Piemonte was was called
 
05:39:41.570 --> 05:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
on and he voted yes so Mr clerk if you
 
05:39:43.430 --> 05:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
would continue with the vote
 
05:39:46.570 --> 05:39:46.580 align:start position:0%
good folks uh yes
 
05:39:50.090 --> 05:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
sure yes
 
05:39:50.100 --> 05:39:54.788 align:start position:0%
sure yes
traffic

05:39:54.788 --> 05:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:01.010 --> 05:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:05.590 --> 05:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
sorry about that yes thank you
 
05:40:11.510 --> 05:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:13.430 --> 05:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative McBride you're also on
 
05:40:17.868 --> 05:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:21.110 --> 05:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:23.350 --> 05:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
okay let's uh let's go past the
 
05:40:25.490 --> 05:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
representative McBride and uh
 
05:40:29.570 --> 05:40:29.580 align:start position:0%

representative McBride not being here
 
05:40:59.448 --> 05:40:59.458 align:start position:0%

05:41:03.288 --> 05:41:03.298 align:start position:0%

05:43:02.050 --> 05:43:02.060 align:start position:0%
come on I just said yes
 
05:43:04.490 --> 05:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
all right so here's what the rule is the
 
05:43:06.410 --> 05:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
rule is that when we're in the voting
 
05:43:09.410 --> 05:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
mode what before unless a first unless I
 
05:43:11.868 --> 05:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
can see a person when they vote that
 
05:43:13.490 --> 05:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
their vote won't count
 
05:43:17.470 --> 05:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
uh and uh in the last time this happened
 
05:43:22.128 --> 05:43:22.138 align:start position:0%
uh representative McBride uh wanted to
 
05:43:24.410 --> 05:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
uh Express his vote but I couldn't see
 
05:43:26.930 --> 05:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
him when he uh was trying to vote and
 
05:43:29.150 --> 05:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
therefore I disallowed his vote in this
 
05:43:33.170 --> 05:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
particular case uh he his video was
 
05:43:35.570 --> 05:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
turned off during the discussion but
 
05:43:37.970 --> 05:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
when it was time to vote just as we just
 
05:43:40.788 --> 05:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
recently uh went back to him at the end
 
05:43:43.670 --> 05:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
of the list I did see his face the
 
05:43:45.350 --> 05:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
purpose of that rule is to make sure
 
05:43:48.170 --> 05:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
that the people who vote are people who
 
05:43:50.330 --> 05:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
are on our activity and and there isn't
 
05:43:52.250 --> 05:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
some type of a proxy voting that's going
 
05:43:52.260 --> 05:43:57.730 align:start position:0%
some type of a proxy voting that's going
on

05:43:57.730 --> 05:43:57.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:59.868 --> 05:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
I have been expelled from
 
05:44:02.150 --> 05:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
Representatives hall for not being
 
05:44:04.910 --> 05:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
present for the vote and I was not able
 
05:44:06.530 --> 05:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
05:44:08.270 --> 05:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
I know those are those are different
 
05:44:09.890 --> 05:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
rules when we're in representative Hall
 
05:44:11.930 --> 05:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
this is these are rules for this these
 
05:44:17.930 --> 05:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:19.850 --> 05:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
chair I just got a message from the
 
05:44:23.510 --> 05:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
clerk my message to him was he was not
 
05:44:25.810 --> 05:44:25.820 align:start position:0%
on the screen when the vote was called
 
05:44:29.570 --> 05:44:29.580 align:start position:0%
can he vote and the answer is not
 
05:44:32.270 --> 05:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to not present when the
 
05:44:35.030 --> 05:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
question was put
 
05:44:37.368 --> 05:44:37.378 align:start position:0%
on Paul that's right he was not there's
 
05:44:40.670 --> 05:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
a question have them call me is what uh
 
05:44:43.010 --> 05:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
clerk Smith has just said so I'm just
 
05:44:44.990 --> 05:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
passing that along to you if you're not
 
05:44:46.368 --> 05:44:46.378 align:start position:0%
in the room when the vote is called you
 
05:44:47.930 --> 05:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
cannot vote
 
05:44:50.930 --> 05:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
right just as if I was in the lob with
 
05:44:53.448 --> 05:44:53.458 align:start position:0%
you which I wish I was as a matter of
 
05:44:55.910 --> 05:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
fact and I had to run out for an
 
05:44:57.970 --> 05:44:57.980 align:start position:0%
emergency for a phone call for anything
 
05:45:00.350 --> 05:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
you were in the I was in the voting mode
 
05:45:02.570 --> 05:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
when I left the room I couldn't vote
 
05:45:04.788 --> 05:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
when I came back period final the end
 
05:45:07.368 --> 05:45:07.378 align:start position:0%
all right here's here's a ruling right
 
05:45:09.288 --> 05:45:09.298 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to allow the vote I'll
 
05:45:10.788 --> 05:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
make a commitment to you that I will
 
05:45:13.910 --> 05:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
check with the with the house Clerk and
 
05:45:16.670 --> 05:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh and if that if he comes back and uh
 
05:45:19.310 --> 05:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
says that I did it the wrong way that uh
 
05:45:21.170 --> 05:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
I'll come back and tell you that
 
05:45:25.368 --> 05:45:25.378 align:start position:0%
and here is that isn't that a rule that
 
05:45:29.868 --> 05:45:29.878 align:start position:0%
we have to clarify if that uh yes can
 
05:45:32.030 --> 05:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
clarify because this is a voting mode
 
05:45:35.270 --> 05:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
question that we have so to go back and
 
05:45:38.930 --> 05:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
fix it and we are actually in the mode
 
05:45:41.948 --> 05:45:41.958 align:start position:0%
and we are asking for a clarification
 
05:45:45.470 --> 05:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that our clarification be uh
 
05:45:48.470 --> 05:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
provided when we are actually dealing
 
05:45:51.590 --> 05:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:53.868 --> 05:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
representative power you have a comment
 
05:45:56.570 --> 05:45:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I have a point of
 
05:45:58.970 --> 05:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
clarification yeah it is my
 
05:46:01.970 --> 05:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
understanding that in this committee a
 
05:46:04.310 --> 05:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
Committee Member shall not speak unless
 
05:46:06.410 --> 05:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
and until they are properly acknowledged
 
05:46:07.610 --> 05:46:07.620 align:start position:0%
by the chair
 
05:46:07.620 --> 05:46:09.170 align:start position:0%
by the chair
so

05:46:09.170 --> 05:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:46:11.750 --> 05:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
to be clear I have been asked to be the
 
05:46:15.788 --> 05:46:15.798 align:start position:0%
technology monitor for soon and so after
 
05:46:19.368 --> 05:46:19.378 align:start position:0%
Representatives have been recognized and
 
05:46:21.110 --> 05:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
have spoken
 
05:46:23.810 --> 05:46:23.820 align:start position:0%
it was my understanding that in order to
 
05:46:27.410 --> 05:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
maintain order in this committee meeting
 
05:46:30.048 --> 05:46:30.058 align:start position:0%
that I shall
 
05:46:33.410 --> 05:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
be able as the moderator to be able to
 
05:46:36.590 --> 05:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
mute people and if they have their hands
 
05:46:38.628 --> 05:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
raised digitally
 
05:46:42.470 --> 05:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
I shall alert the chair of that and you
 
05:46:44.750 --> 05:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
will properly
 
05:46:47.230 --> 05:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
allow them to speak
 
05:46:50.628 --> 05:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
Representatives speaking out of term is
 
05:46:50.638 --> 05:46:51.948 align:start position:0%
Representatives speaking out of term is
is

05:46:51.948 --> 05:46:51.958 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:46:55.670 --> 05:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
um confusing right you're right uh and
 
05:46:57.048 --> 05:46:57.058 align:start position:0%
I've made a commitment to the committee
 
05:46:59.690 --> 05:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
what I will do is I will check with the
 
05:47:02.690 --> 05:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
house Clerk and make sure that the rule
 
05:47:05.690 --> 05:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
As I understood it and expressed it is
 
05:47:07.368 --> 05:47:07.378 align:start position:0%
appropriate if not
 
05:47:09.650 --> 05:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
you have my word that I'll come back and
 
05:47:12.410 --> 05:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
change it you saw the first time this
 
05:47:14.628 --> 05:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
happened it was in my judgment that the
 
05:47:17.990 --> 05:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
vote shouldn't count and uh that's what
 
05:47:20.090 --> 05:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
we did the other thing we could do is we
 
05:47:22.128 --> 05:47:22.138 align:start position:0%
could reconsider this bill and then
 
05:47:25.190 --> 05:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
bonus another time which I I have a
 
05:47:27.770 --> 05:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
feeling is going to result in the same
 
05:47:32.110 --> 05:47:32.120 align:start position:0%
outcome but uh I will I think it's worth
 
05:47:35.150 --> 05:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
clarifying was represent with uh Clark
 
05:47:37.548 --> 05:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
Smith just to make sure we all know what
 
05:47:39.230 --> 05:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
the rule is
 
05:47:41.330 --> 05:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
so representative 40 had one last
 
05:47:43.430 --> 05:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
comment I do want to I do want to move
 
05:47:45.470 --> 05:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
forward and then come back to this Mr
 
05:47:48.110 --> 05:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
chair I fully understand the issue that
 
05:47:50.208 --> 05:47:50.218 align:start position:0%
um representative McBride and I
 
05:47:52.670 --> 05:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
sympathize with him but when we are
 
05:47:55.010 --> 05:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
having an executive session we have to
 
05:47:57.350 --> 05:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
be present for the executive session and
 
05:47:59.750 --> 05:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
if he if he is has to be at his place of
 
05:48:02.150 --> 05:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
work I understand that then he needs to
 
05:48:04.190 --> 05:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
step back from the executive session so
 
05:48:06.948 --> 05:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
he can do his job but if he's going to
 
05:48:09.288 --> 05:48:09.298 align:start position:0%
be with us for an executive session then
 
05:48:11.690 --> 05:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
he needs to step back from his job to
 
05:48:15.170 --> 05:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
perform his legislative duties I really
 
05:48:17.330 --> 05:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
hope that when you speak with Mr with
 
05:48:19.610 --> 05:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
the clerk that we can get some kind of a
 
05:48:22.010 --> 05:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
ruling that's clear on this that we
 
05:48:23.990 --> 05:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
understand the situation
 
05:48:27.410 --> 05:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
we just feel like if the rule is you
 
05:48:29.570 --> 05:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
have to be on screen to vote then you
 
05:48:31.548 --> 05:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
have to be there and that's the rule
 
05:48:34.190 --> 05:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
that we all had I mean we have we have
 
05:48:36.890 --> 05:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
house members who do not have access to
 
05:48:39.590 --> 05:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
a computer who call in and they have
 
05:48:42.288 --> 05:48:42.298 align:start position:0%
been house members for generations and
 
05:48:43.670 --> 05:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
they can't vote in their committee
 
05:48:45.470 --> 05:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
because they can't be seen on screen
 
05:48:45.480 --> 05:48:47.110 align:start position:0%
because they can't be seen on screen
right

05:48:47.110 --> 05:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:48:50.510 --> 05:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
and I I have uh I told you what I'm
 
05:48:54.110 --> 05:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
going to do and I will be fair uh and I
 
05:48:57.170 --> 05:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
will represent represent to you exactly
 
05:49:00.410 --> 05:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
when I'm told uh and you know
 
05:49:04.250 --> 05:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
the clerk he will not uh issue any type
 
05:49:07.128 --> 05:49:07.138 align:start position:0%
of advice without uh with any type of
 
05:49:09.288 --> 05:49:09.298 align:start position:0%
party affiliation he will be
 
05:49:12.530 --> 05:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
straightforward and give us uh what the
 
05:49:17.330 --> 05:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:19.430 --> 05:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I apologize
 
05:49:22.250 --> 05:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
representative power if I offended you
 
05:49:24.770 --> 05:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
in any way I was feeling very emotional
 
05:49:26.150 --> 05:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
05:49:28.430 --> 05:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
um I have been in sessions where we've
 
05:49:30.230 --> 05:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
all been in that LLB room together and
 
05:49:32.570 --> 05:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
it's been great and we've had to rain
 
05:49:35.208 --> 05:49:35.218 align:start position:0%
ourselves in to get our comments going
 
05:49:37.250 --> 05:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
and I will endeavor to do that in the
 
05:49:38.990 --> 05:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
future thank you for listening to me as
 
05:49:42.708 --> 05:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
well and it looks like uh the clerk uh
 
05:49:46.788 --> 05:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
Mr Smith has joined our Zoom meeting so
 
05:49:50.390 --> 05:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
let me uh are you there Paul
 
05:49:52.850 --> 05:49:52.860 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman I'm here sir yeah so
 
05:49:56.570 --> 05:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
here's the question we have a member who
 
05:49:59.448 --> 05:49:59.458 align:start position:0%
uh stopped his video uh during
 
05:50:01.788 --> 05:50:01.798 align:start position:0%
discussion uh uh in the executive
 
05:50:04.788 --> 05:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
session and when the first when we came
 
05:50:08.868 --> 05:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
around to vote he was not on screen
 
05:50:11.750 --> 05:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
so uh we came back to him at the end of
 
05:50:12.708 --> 05:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
the vote
 
05:50:15.410 --> 05:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
to catch up with him see what his vote
 
05:50:17.690 --> 05:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
was at that time he was on screen on
 
05:50:20.448 --> 05:50:20.458 align:start position:0%
video and so the question is should his
 
05:50:23.330 --> 05:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
vote count or not
 
05:50:26.690 --> 05:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
well Mr Mr chairman I I would only state
 
05:50:29.150 --> 05:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
to you that the prior uh determination
 
05:50:32.270 --> 05:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
by the speaker of the house was that in
 
05:50:35.330 --> 05:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
order to participate uh during a roll
 
05:50:39.590 --> 05:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
call vote uh you do have to be on screen
 
05:50:42.230 --> 05:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
um to cast your vote
 
05:50:44.690 --> 05:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
um that being said I I would also note
 
05:50:47.690 --> 05:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
that if a member is not present when the
 
05:50:50.868 --> 05:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
question is put that they should not be
 
05:50:53.448 --> 05:50:53.458 align:start position:0%
voting on the matter just as if they
 
05:50:55.788 --> 05:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
were not at their seat in the committee
 
05:50:57.590 --> 05:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
room at the time that you called the
 
05:51:00.350 --> 05:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
question uh they should not be uh
 
05:51:03.110 --> 05:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
casting a vote okay thank you for that
 
05:51:04.850 --> 05:51:04.860 align:start position:0%
clarification that's slightly different
 
05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
than what I had
 
05:51:09.170 --> 05:51:09.180 align:start position:0%
uh enumerated to the committee uh but
 
05:51:11.868 --> 05:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
let me ask you this also while you're
 
05:51:14.690 --> 05:51:14.700 align:start position:0%
here is would it be appropriate
 
05:51:18.730 --> 05:51:18.740 align:start position:0%
uh when this is uh when this particular
 
05:51:22.670 --> 05:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
vote is complete that if somebody on the
 
05:51:22.680 --> 05:51:24.250 align:start position:0%
vote is complete that if somebody on the
committee

05:51:24.250 --> 05:51:24.260 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:51:27.288 --> 05:51:27.298 align:start position:0%
made a motion to reconsider
 
05:51:30.048 --> 05:51:30.058 align:start position:0%
that particular bill that a new vote
 
05:51:31.610 --> 05:51:31.620 align:start position:0%
could be taken
 
05:51:34.250 --> 05:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
and the the member that was
 
05:51:37.430 --> 05:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
was virtually absent for the first vote
 
05:51:40.730 --> 05:51:40.740 align:start position:0%
could vote that second time uh if if the
 
05:51:43.310 --> 05:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
voters reconsidered uh yes Mr chairman
 
05:51:45.350 --> 05:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
that is a courtesy frequently extended
 
05:51:47.090 --> 05:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
uh that we actually had a similar
 
05:51:48.708 --> 05:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
situation in another committee today
 
05:51:51.288 --> 05:51:51.298 align:start position:0%
where that uh that variation came up and
 
05:51:55.250 --> 05:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
a vote was reconsidered and uh a member
 
05:51:57.170 --> 05:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
who was not able to participate in the
 
05:51:59.090 --> 05:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
first vote was able to in the second so
 
05:52:01.190 --> 05:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
yes that is certainly uh within the
 
05:52:02.690 --> 05:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
purview of the committee if they so
 
05:52:05.090 --> 05:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
choose to uh to to take the motion to
 
05:52:05.100 --> 05:52:06.368 align:start position:0%
choose to uh to to take the motion to
reconsider

05:52:06.368 --> 05:52:06.378 align:start position:0%
reconsider
 
05:52:08.628 --> 05:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Paul really appreciate that
 
05:52:10.670 --> 05:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
that's uh was clarifying for both me and
 
05:52:13.368 --> 05:52:13.378 align:start position:0%
the committee anytime sir
 
05:52:14.690 --> 05:52:14.700 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
05:52:17.990 --> 05:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
so is there a uh so we are about a
 
05:52:21.048 --> 05:52:21.058 align:start position:0%
discount uh representative McBride's
 
05:52:23.990 --> 05:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
vote and Mr Clark how is that the vote
 
05:52:26.750 --> 05:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
that that how is the total may vote if
 
05:52:29.230 --> 05:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
that's discounted it'll be nine through
 
05:52:32.510 --> 05:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
99. so we have a nine to nine vote
 
05:52:35.750 --> 05:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
for the committee for the for an Ott as
 
05:52:39.110 --> 05:52:39.120 align:start position:0%

let me say that uh
 
05:55:07.910 --> 05:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh I think is that a teachable point of
 
05:55:11.090 --> 05:55:11.100 align:start position:0%
view from the house clerk uh and I stand
 
05:55:14.770 --> 05:55:14.780 align:start position:0%
corrected that anybody who is
 
05:55:19.490 --> 05:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
not on screen uh during the when the
 
05:55:20.990 --> 05:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
question is raised
 
05:55:23.930 --> 05:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
or during the voting itself will be
 
05:55:27.770 --> 05:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
excluded from future votes so that's a
 
05:55:29.570 --> 05:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
that's hopefully something we just all
 
05:55:32.330 --> 05:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
took away from that discussion with uh
 
05:55:35.990 --> 05:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
with Paul uh so Paul Smith so uh please
 
05:55:38.030 --> 05:55:38.040 align:start position:0%

05:59:55.850 --> 05:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
have a volunteer to write the minority

the chair
 
06:00:12.890 --> 06:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
I apologize this is representative
 
06:00:16.190 --> 06:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
majority I'm just I'm just curious we
 
06:00:18.350 --> 06:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
only need them The Minority Report on
 
06:00:23.150 --> 06:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
243 right because 4 15 and I imagine 454
 
06:00:24.590 --> 06:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
are going to go in consent I imagine
 
06:00:27.650 --> 06:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
correct that objection output 4.59
 
06:00:27.660 --> 06:00:32.110 align:start position:0%
correct that objection output 4.59
percent

06:00:32.110 --> 06:00:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:35.990 --> 06:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
so we just need a committee report even
 
06:00:37.610 --> 06:00:37.620 align:start position:0%
if it goes on consent but we don't need
 
06:00:39.948 --> 06:00:39.958 align:start position:0%
a Minority Report so I'll ask for every
 
06:00:43.128 --> 06:00:43.138 align:start position:0%
10 minutes to write that
 
06:00:46.010 --> 06:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
as the uh as the one who made me made

which is the I can remind you that's the
 
06:04:08.330 --> 06:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
one about emergency housing assistance
 
06:04:11.330 --> 06:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
if you uh hopefully you have that uh
 
06:04:13.910 --> 06:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
some notes in front of you on that uh
 
06:04:16.490 --> 06:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
I'll be looking for a motion I'd like to
 
06:04:18.890 --> 06:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
make a motion we itl
 
06:04:21.650 --> 06:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
house bill 512. is there a second second
 
06:04:23.930 --> 06:04:23.940 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman motion's been made in second
 
06:04:26.030 --> 06:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
it's a discussion on this bill before we
 
06:04:28.850 --> 06:04:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:31.970 --> 06:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
uh yeah yes Mr chair yes representative
 
06:04:34.970 --> 06:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
I can't find my my hand
 
06:04:37.910 --> 06:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
right now okay good
 
06:04:37.920 --> 06:04:40.610 align:start position:0%
right now okay good
um

06:04:40.610 --> 06:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:43.368 --> 06:04:43.378 align:start position:0%
I think this is an important bill
 
06:04:45.170 --> 06:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
um and I I think we had an amendment
 
06:04:48.350 --> 06:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
that fixed it so that it it was clear as
 
06:04:50.570 --> 06:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
to what would happen
 
06:04:50.580 --> 06:04:51.830 align:start position:0%
to what would happen
um

06:04:51.830 --> 06:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:55.250 --> 06:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
if a community is forcing
 
06:04:58.430 --> 06:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
there's a community is making it a
 
06:05:00.048 --> 06:05:00.058 align:start position:0%
requirement that a house that someone is
 
06:05:02.750 --> 06:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
living in be inspected before they get
 
06:05:04.730 --> 06:05:04.740 align:start position:0%
emergency aid to help them with their
 
06:05:04.740 --> 06:05:05.690 align:start position:0%
emergency aid to help them with their
rent

06:05:05.690 --> 06:05:05.700 align:start position:0%
rent
 
06:05:09.650 --> 06:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
and the owner of that house refuses to
 
06:05:11.990 --> 06:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
have that inspection done as is their
 
06:05:12.000 --> 06:05:13.368 align:start position:0%
have that inspection done as is their
right

06:05:13.368 --> 06:05:13.378 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:05:16.010 --> 06:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
then the renter
 
06:05:18.170 --> 06:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
will not be able to afford their rent
 
06:05:22.788 --> 06:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
and will therefore be evicted from that
 
06:05:26.090 --> 06:05:26.100 align:start position:0%
home and become perhaps homeless because
 
06:05:30.470 --> 06:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:33.470 --> 06:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
through no fault of their own simply
 
06:05:35.990 --> 06:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
because their landlord refused to have
 
06:05:38.208 --> 06:05:38.218 align:start position:0%
this house that they are living in
 
06:05:40.670 --> 06:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
inspected I think it's important for us
 
06:05:43.128 --> 06:05:43.138 align:start position:0%
to realize that in this housing crisis
 
06:05:45.890 --> 06:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
that we have there are no places for
 
06:05:48.890 --> 06:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
people to go and find affordable housing
 
06:05:51.288 --> 06:05:51.298 align:start position:0%
especially for the poorest of the poor
 
06:05:53.570 --> 06:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
and when they are evicted from the
 
06:05:55.610 --> 06:05:55.620 align:start position:0%
housing that they do have they become
 
06:05:55.620 --> 06:05:56.750 align:start position:0%
housing that they do have they become
homeless

06:05:56.750 --> 06:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
homeless
 
06:06:00.170 --> 06:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a humanitarian Bill a
 
06:06:02.150 --> 06:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
bill to help someone who's in Dire
 
06:06:02.160 --> 06:06:03.590 align:start position:0%
bill to help someone who's in Dire
Straits

06:06:03.590 --> 06:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
Straits
 
06:06:05.330 --> 06:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
well I have to go live on the streets
 
06:06:07.490 --> 06:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
and I think it's an important bill and
 
06:06:08.868 --> 06:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
to itl it
 
06:06:12.890 --> 06:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:14.810 --> 06:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
is painful to me
 
06:06:17.930 --> 06:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
I understand uh representative Davis do
 
06:06:19.190 --> 06:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
you have a comment
 
06:06:21.830 --> 06:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
I would like to speak to my Amendment
 
06:06:24.410 --> 06:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to speak to my Amendment
 
06:06:27.530 --> 06:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
oh yes the amendment
 
06:06:30.650 --> 06:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
list it was under the under the auspices
 
06:06:31.610 --> 06:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
of an
 
06:06:34.670 --> 06:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
OTP motion so if this motion fails itl
 
06:06:37.070 --> 06:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
then then we'll get into the amendment
 
06:06:39.948 --> 06:06:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:42.948 --> 06:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
okay is there other is there additional
 
06:06:46.250 --> 06:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:46.260 --> 06:06:47.690 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:06:47.690 --> 06:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:06:51.190 --> 06:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles did you know
 
06:06:55.690 --> 06:06:55.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:59.330 --> 06:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
before about uh
 
06:07:03.190 --> 06:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:07.010 --> 06:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
let me uh let me just say that I know
 
06:07:09.110 --> 06:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
that there has some there is some
 
06:07:11.150 --> 06:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
concern I know I have some concern
 
06:07:13.548 --> 06:07:13.558 align:start position:0%
uh about
 
06:07:15.830 --> 06:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable among us and we're
 
06:07:17.270 --> 06:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about I'm
 
06:07:21.708 --> 06:07:21.718 align:start position:0%
thinking of a of a young mother with uh
 
06:07:24.708 --> 06:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
without a father and children that are
 
06:07:25.670 --> 06:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
in need
 
06:07:25.680 --> 06:07:26.868 align:start position:0%
in need
and

06:07:26.868 --> 06:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:07:29.628 --> 06:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns was that
 
06:07:32.690 --> 06:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
in a emergency situation these people
 
06:07:35.208 --> 06:07:35.218 align:start position:0%
may be placed in unsafe
 
06:07:35.218 --> 06:07:36.948 align:start position:0%
may be placed in unsafe
uh

06:07:36.948 --> 06:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:07:36.958 --> 06:07:38.770 align:start position:0%
uh
unsafe

06:07:38.770 --> 06:07:38.780 align:start position:0%
unsafe
 
06:07:43.430 --> 06:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
housing where there could be
 
06:07:48.650 --> 06:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:52.910 --> 06:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
bed bugs or Vermin or whatever and that
 
06:07:54.770 --> 06:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
06:07:58.010 --> 06:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
the code enforcement folks that would
 
06:08:01.690 --> 06:08:01.700 align:start position:0%
look out for this uh wouldn't be able to
 
06:08:06.590 --> 06:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
intervene and uh so the question that
 
06:08:12.350 --> 06:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
haunts me is is uh how would I feel if
 
06:08:15.770 --> 06:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
somebody in that situation which they're
 
06:08:17.690 --> 06:08:17.700 align:start position:0%
unlikely to be picky and say no I don't
 
06:08:19.250 --> 06:08:19.260 align:start position:0%
like this place let me look at someplace
 
06:08:19.260 --> 06:08:20.090 align:start position:0%
like this place let me look at someplace
else

06:08:20.090 --> 06:08:20.100 align:start position:0%
else
 
06:08:22.490 --> 06:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh they're probably going to be such
 
06:08:24.350 --> 06:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
desperate need that they're going to
 
06:08:27.410 --> 06:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
take whatever they get that they uh
 
06:08:30.650 --> 06:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
they won't be able to uh to push back
 
06:08:33.350 --> 06:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
and and they may end up in substandard
 
06:08:36.590 --> 06:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
housing uh that could put them or their
 
06:08:36.600 --> 06:08:38.270 align:start position:0%
housing uh that could put them or their
children

06:08:38.270 --> 06:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:08:41.030 --> 06:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
so uh representative status did you have
 
06:08:42.708 --> 06:08:42.718 align:start position:0%
a comment that was that is that an old
 
06:08:45.590 --> 06:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
hand up oh it's a new hand up I do have
 
06:08:48.110 --> 06:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
a comment yes
 
06:08:50.990 --> 06:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
by the image of a young thought
 
06:08:53.990 --> 06:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
with no mother for his children
 
06:08:57.170 --> 06:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
not being able to find a roof over his
 
06:08:59.570 --> 06:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
head because this bill doesn't last
 
06:09:02.330 --> 06:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
there is nothing more dangerous than
 
06:09:04.190 --> 06:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
living in outside
 
06:09:08.628 --> 06:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
in dire conditions in a car or in a tent
 
06:09:10.850 --> 06:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
and this girl would alleviate that
 
06:09:10.860 --> 06:09:12.110 align:start position:0%
and this girl would alleviate that
problem

06:09:12.110 --> 06:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
problem
 
06:09:14.628 --> 06:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
and I would remind the chair and my
 
06:09:16.850 --> 06:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the committee the towns
 
06:09:18.830 --> 06:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
and cities in New Hampshire are required
 
06:09:21.650 --> 06:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
by law to provide emergency housing
 
06:09:24.708 --> 06:09:24.718 align:start position:0%
assistance it is not optional
 
06:09:30.128 --> 06:09:30.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:32.510 --> 06:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative Gallenberg you had a
 
06:09:32.520 --> 06:09:34.070 align:start position:0%
representative Gallenberg you had a
comment

06:09:34.070 --> 06:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
comment
 
06:09:34.080 --> 06:09:35.330 align:start position:0%
comment
yeah

06:09:35.330 --> 06:09:35.340 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:09:35.340 --> 06:09:35.930 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

06:09:35.930 --> 06:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:35.940 --> 06:09:37.010 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:09:37.010 --> 06:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:09:41.448 --> 06:09:41.458 align:start position:0%
ask one of those vulnerable persons who
 
06:09:43.850 --> 06:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
is currently living in what could be
 
06:09:46.310 --> 06:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
described as substandard housing I have
 
06:09:49.430 --> 06:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
had major bed bug problems here recently
 
06:09:54.288 --> 06:09:54.298 align:start position:0%
I can I can say for certain that I
 
06:09:56.750 --> 06:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
definitely prefer
 
06:10:01.070 --> 06:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
having housing even if it is substandard
 
06:10:05.810 --> 06:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
over possibly being homeless so yeah I
 
06:10:08.570 --> 06:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
would say that
 
06:10:10.548 --> 06:10:10.558 align:start position:0%
give yeah given the choice between the
 
06:10:13.310 --> 06:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
two I I think this bill is the right
 
06:10:16.490 --> 06:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
direction and that housing is good even
 
06:10:18.948 --> 06:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
when substandard
 
06:10:23.270 --> 06:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:25.128 --> 06:10:25.138 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I think we're putting it
 
06:10:27.470 --> 06:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
back on the towns and um
 
06:10:29.690 --> 06:10:29.700 align:start position:0%
usually if someone in our town becomes
 
06:10:32.150 --> 06:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
homeless we put them up in a hotel
 
06:10:34.730 --> 06:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
in the meantime we notify the federal
 
06:10:36.170 --> 06:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
government because most likely they're
 
06:10:38.990 --> 06:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
going to go to section 8 housing because
 
06:10:41.090 --> 06:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
they're you know apartments and stuff
 
06:10:44.868 --> 06:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
are section eight we have them we know
 
06:10:46.310 --> 06:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
those are inspected by the federal
 
06:10:48.288 --> 06:10:48.298 align:start position:0%
government they're maintained by federal
 
06:10:50.570 --> 06:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
government and if they don't pass the
 
06:10:50.580 --> 06:10:51.708 align:start position:0%
government and if they don't pass the
inspection

06:10:51.708 --> 06:10:51.718 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
06:10:54.170 --> 06:10:54.180 align:start position:0%
they can't they can't move in they don't
 
06:10:57.110 --> 06:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
get to collect their rent from the feds
 
06:10:59.690 --> 06:10:59.700 align:start position:0%
that's how it's done usually
 
06:11:02.270 --> 06:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative
 
06:11:07.310 --> 06:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh in Nashua that
 
06:11:09.770 --> 06:11:09.780 align:start position:0%
housing is such a big crisis in terms of
 
06:11:11.930 --> 06:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
not having enough housing for people
 
06:11:13.368 --> 06:11:13.378 align:start position:0%
that need
 
06:11:17.090 --> 06:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh Section 8 Housing section 40 housing
 
06:11:19.250 --> 06:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
senior housing there's a long waiting
 
06:11:23.150 --> 06:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
list so if I am living in a substandard
 
06:11:27.410 --> 06:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
housing and I don't have the
 
06:11:30.470 --> 06:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
um way of getting help
 
06:11:33.288 --> 06:11:33.298 align:start position:0%
and I get evicted because the landlord
 
06:11:35.750 --> 06:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to abide by what my
 
06:11:39.110 --> 06:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
requirement is I have no place to go so
 
06:11:42.948 --> 06:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
the vulnerable it's not just the uh one
 
06:11:46.368 --> 06:11:46.378 align:start position:0%
particular segment it can be any segment
 
06:11:49.548 --> 06:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
of perhaps the most vulnerable poorest
 
06:11:53.930 --> 06:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
of the poor yes HUD does provide Health
 
06:11:56.510 --> 06:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
but there's a long waiting list
 
06:12:01.430 --> 06:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
there's minus 1.5 percent vacancy rate
 
06:12:05.330 --> 06:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
how do you explain to that uh so to me
 
06:12:08.090 --> 06:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
this is unconscionable it's very
 
06:12:10.430 --> 06:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
difficult for me to look the other way
 
06:12:13.010 --> 06:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
and in a cold country
 
06:12:15.230 --> 06:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
this is difficult thank you
 
06:12:18.650 --> 06:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:21.948 --> 06:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
yes my understanding of this bill is not
 
06:12:25.250 --> 06:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
about placing people in substandard
 
06:12:29.930 --> 06:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
housing it is about providing uh funds
 
06:12:33.230 --> 06:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
from the town to pay the rent for
 
06:12:36.288 --> 06:12:36.298 align:start position:0%
someone who is in a building and cannot
 
06:12:39.830 --> 06:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
pay their rent currently uh the way it
 
06:12:42.170 --> 06:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
was originally written if the landlord
 
06:12:44.930 --> 06:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
would not allow an inspection of the
 
06:12:46.670 --> 06:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
unit that the person is already living
 
06:12:50.690 --> 06:12:50.700 align:start position:0%
in then the town could not disperse
 
06:12:52.548 --> 06:12:52.558 align:start position:0%
those funds as they are required by
 
06:12:55.368 --> 06:12:55.378 align:start position:0%
Statute to do so this is not about
 
06:12:57.708 --> 06:12:57.718 align:start position:0%
putting people someplace worse than they
 
06:13:00.830 --> 06:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
are now it is about putting them on this
 
06:13:03.590 --> 06:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
street and I definitely think that we
 
06:13:06.830 --> 06:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
should pass this because we have an
 
06:13:06.840 --> 06:13:07.850 align:start position:0%
should pass this because we have an
emergency

06:13:07.850 --> 06:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
06:13:09.770 --> 06:13:09.780 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Missouri were
 
06:13:13.250 --> 06:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
you able to allow me to co-host
 
06:13:16.310 --> 06:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
Ivory thank you Mr chair I did ask
 
06:13:18.048 --> 06:13:18.058 align:start position:0%
Christina Dyer
 
06:13:21.470 --> 06:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
to do that unfortunately it's not a not
 
06:13:23.448 --> 06:13:23.458 align:start position:0%
a power that I have
 
06:13:25.670 --> 06:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't yeah she did do that you
 
06:13:28.010 --> 06:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
are a co-host you're all set okay thank
 
06:13:31.070 --> 06:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you Christina
 
06:13:35.150 --> 06:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:37.850 --> 06:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I too think this
 
06:13:40.310 --> 06:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
is a very important bill because
 
06:13:44.150 --> 06:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
especially the word emergency so we're
 
06:13:46.010 --> 06:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
talking about an emergency keeping
 
06:13:48.590 --> 06:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
someone in place or putting them in
 
06:13:51.230 --> 06:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
place because it's an emergency and
 
06:13:53.990 --> 06:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the housing inspectors or the
 
06:13:55.368 --> 06:13:55.378 align:start position:0%
building inspectors in towns or
 
06:13:57.410 --> 06:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
communities are swamped with their work
 
06:14:00.048 --> 06:14:00.058 align:start position:0%
and I get that and we don't want people
 
06:14:02.810 --> 06:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
in the street I've lived in a car I've
 
06:14:05.690 --> 06:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
lived in a mobile home I've lived on
 
06:14:07.430 --> 06:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
people's couches luckily I've never
 
06:14:09.890 --> 06:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
slept in a tent or in the woods but
 
06:14:11.270 --> 06:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
there are lots of people who are doing
 
06:14:13.128 --> 06:14:13.138 align:start position:0%
it now and I would prefer that we have
 
06:14:15.670 --> 06:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
less people do it if at all possible
 
06:14:19.070 --> 06:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
representative care I I take your point
 
06:14:22.010 --> 06:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
that a town will put someone in a motel
 
06:14:25.090 --> 06:14:25.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:28.128 --> 06:14:28.138 align:start position:0%
federal government covering it and if we
 
06:14:31.070 --> 06:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
could do if we could bridge that Gap and
 
06:14:33.708 --> 06:14:33.718 align:start position:0%
help them that would be very important
 
06:14:35.628 --> 06:14:35.638 align:start position:0%
to the population of New Hampshire thank
 
06:14:39.410 --> 06:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
you and representative uh Porter if you
 
06:14:41.510 --> 06:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
had an additional comment
 
06:14:43.850 --> 06:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
things are representative I think you've
 
06:14:45.470 --> 06:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding this bill and that's
 
06:14:47.690 --> 06:14:47.700 align:start position:0%
why we had the amendment made this bill
 
06:14:50.150 --> 06:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
does not Place anybody in a home this
 
06:14:52.610 --> 06:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
bill this bill just allows the town to
 
06:14:55.490 --> 06:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
give money to someone who needs money to
 
06:14:56.990 --> 06:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
pay their rent they're not putting them
 
06:14:59.150 --> 06:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
any place that they're not already so
 
06:15:01.010 --> 06:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
that's that's why we have the amendment
 
06:15:03.770 --> 06:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
made so that that would be clear and
 
06:15:06.730 --> 06:15:06.740 align:start position:0%
number two can we take a potty break
 
06:15:09.288 --> 06:15:09.298 align:start position:0%

um just disgusting Little Critters as
 
06:24:45.470 --> 06:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
they are and I'm sorry that anyone has
 
06:24:48.288 --> 06:24:48.298 align:start position:0%
to live under those conditions but um as
 
06:24:50.208 --> 06:24:50.218 align:start position:0%
a person who has fought for constituents
 
06:24:52.128 --> 06:24:52.138 align:start position:0%
bed bugs believe it or not are not
 
06:24:54.048 --> 06:24:54.058 align:start position:0%
considered substandard don't ask me why
 
06:24:55.788 --> 06:24:55.798 align:start position:0%
but they're not considered substandard
 
06:24:55.798 --> 06:24:56.750 align:start position:0%
but they're not considered substandard
but

06:24:56.750 --> 06:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:24:56.760 --> 06:24:57.410 align:start position:0%
but
um

06:24:57.410 --> 06:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:59.930 --> 06:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
I I specifically asked this question
 
06:25:02.750 --> 06:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
when we had the public hearing is this
 
06:25:06.110 --> 06:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
for displaced people as we had had here
 
06:25:08.208 --> 06:25:08.218 align:start position:0%
in Nashville when we had a facade that
 
06:25:10.190 --> 06:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
fell off um and we had a head of fire
 
06:25:12.948 --> 06:25:12.958 align:start position:0%
and I was told no that that was not the
 
06:25:14.628 --> 06:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
case this was for people who were
 
06:25:17.510 --> 06:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
currently in housing
 
06:25:19.128 --> 06:25:19.138 align:start position:0%
um and whether or not that they would
 
06:25:21.288 --> 06:25:21.298 align:start position:0%
get help with their rent or whatever the
 
06:25:23.330 --> 06:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
the situation was
 
06:25:25.070 --> 06:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
um so I think we really do need to
 
06:25:26.868 --> 06:25:26.878 align:start position:0%
clarify that and I think my colleagues
 
06:25:29.570 --> 06:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
have also brought that point up I think
 
06:25:31.850 --> 06:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
it's extremely important that we realize
 
06:25:34.070 --> 06:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
that this has not been displaced
 
06:25:37.548 --> 06:25:37.558 align:start position:0%
um individuals rather it is for
 
06:25:40.850 --> 06:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
um to basically stay in place
 
06:25:42.890 --> 06:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
06:25:45.048 --> 06:25:45.058 align:start position:0%
Porter you had an additional comment yes
 
06:25:46.730 --> 06:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
I I did thank you Mr chair for letting
 
06:25:48.948 --> 06:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
me speak representative air I think this
 
06:25:51.770 --> 06:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
bill is aimed at those communities in
 
06:25:54.170 --> 06:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
your community it's things are working
 
06:25:57.350 --> 06:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
fine but in other communities
 
06:26:00.410 --> 06:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
they may not this bill would prevent
 
06:26:02.448 --> 06:26:02.458 align:start position:0%
someone from being
 
06:26:06.170 --> 06:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
would make it so that inspections would
 
06:26:07.368 --> 06:26:07.378 align:start position:0%
not be
 
06:26:10.128 --> 06:26:10.138 align:start position:0%
have to be made some communities are
 
06:26:12.890 --> 06:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
inspecting and then refusing to give the
 
06:26:15.230 --> 06:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
aid because it's a substandard house and
 
06:26:17.330 --> 06:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill is trying to
 
06:26:19.730 --> 06:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
accomplish not all communities do it the
 
06:26:22.490 --> 06:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
same way so in Hillsboro we might not go
 
06:26:23.930 --> 06:26:23.940 align:start position:0%
and ask for an inspection we just
 
06:26:26.270 --> 06:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
automatically give the money to help
 
06:26:27.890 --> 06:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
with the rent but in another Community
 
06:26:30.110 --> 06:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
when someone comes in for to ask for
 
06:26:31.788 --> 06:26:31.798 align:start position:0%
help with the rent they might send the
 
06:26:34.128 --> 06:26:34.138 align:start position:0%
inspector out and if the if the landlord
 
06:26:36.830 --> 06:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
refuses the inspection then they won't
 
06:26:38.810 --> 06:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
give the help and it might not be very
 
06:26:41.150 --> 06:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
many communities but it does happen in
 
06:26:43.670 --> 06:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
the state and that's why the sponsors of
 
06:26:45.948 --> 06:26:45.958 align:start position:0%
this bill brought it forward as a as a
 
06:26:48.288 --> 06:26:48.298 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation so that to prevent
 
06:26:50.628 --> 06:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
someone from doing that so if that
 
06:26:53.690 --> 06:26:53.700 align:start position:0%
clarifies for you thank you
 
06:26:56.150 --> 06:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
from our distinguished ranking member of
 
06:26:58.548 --> 06:26:58.558 align:start position:0%
Representative mangiori you have uh the
 
06:27:01.128 --> 06:27:01.138 align:start position:0%
next uh opportunity to speak
 
06:27:03.770 --> 06:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chair and thank you uh
 
06:27:06.048 --> 06:27:06.058 align:start position:0%
for I guess I guess taking the question
 
06:27:08.810 --> 06:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
actually I was going to say piggyback on
 
06:27:10.310 --> 06:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
what representative Porter just said I
 
06:27:11.868 --> 06:27:11.878 align:start position:0%
was speaking with the former uh
 
06:27:14.330 --> 06:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
inspector uh who I just happened to bump
 
06:27:16.128 --> 06:27:16.138 align:start position:0%
into a couple of days ago who's in a
 
06:27:17.990 --> 06:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
town not too far away from where one of
 
06:27:19.910 --> 06:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
these both of these sponsors live and
 
06:27:22.430 --> 06:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
said exactly what uh representative
 
06:27:24.650 --> 06:27:24.660 align:start position:0%
Porter said there are instances where
 
06:27:27.530 --> 06:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
they find themselves saying no uh and
 
06:27:29.510 --> 06:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm just going to ask I'm going
 
06:27:31.250 --> 06:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
to implore that the the committee
 
06:27:34.208 --> 06:27:34.218 align:start position:0%
seriously consider voting down the itl
 
06:27:37.310 --> 06:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
so that we can that we can reconsider at
 
06:27:39.110 --> 06:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
least have the discussion about how this
 
06:27:42.310 --> 06:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:48.590 --> 06:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:50.990 --> 06:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
yeah we just we just had a big fire and
 
06:27:53.570 --> 06:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
a big apartment house burnt down and the
 
06:27:55.788 --> 06:27:55.798 align:start position:0%
state stepped right in gave us forty
 
06:27:57.890 --> 06:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the people that got
 
06:28:00.530 --> 06:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
burned out for their first month's rent
 
06:28:02.510 --> 06:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
in a security deposit
 
06:28:04.430 --> 06:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
that came from the state
 
06:28:07.190 --> 06:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
and we also had other monies we gave
 
06:28:10.970 --> 06:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
them to keep them in the Exeter in
 
06:28:12.948 --> 06:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
for the whole time that they were until
 
06:28:16.270 --> 06:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:18.230 --> 06:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
is out there
 
06:28:20.868 --> 06:28:20.878 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative hand up I
 
06:28:23.510 --> 06:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
put it down did you still want to see
 
06:28:26.628 --> 06:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair I wanted to ask if
 
06:28:28.490 --> 06:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
representative McBride could put himself
 
06:28:30.610 --> 06:28:30.620 align:start position:0%
on mute he's married
 
06:28:34.788 --> 06:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
I apologize I apologize no thank you I
 
06:28:36.708 --> 06:28:36.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate that that's all I wanted to
 
06:28:39.230 --> 06:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
say thank you thank you representative
 
06:28:41.390 --> 06:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
magic Rudy
 
06:28:45.048 --> 06:28:45.058 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I just want to add
 
06:28:48.288 --> 06:28:48.298 align:start position:0%
another comment it's not a you know yes
 
06:28:50.750 --> 06:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
our city does a wonderful job we have a
 
06:28:52.788 --> 06:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
shelter we have transitional home all
 
06:28:55.670 --> 06:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
those stuff but the problem right now is
 
06:28:59.330 --> 06:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
that such a big demand for housing if
 
06:29:02.510 --> 06:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
something happens if I have a roof over
 
06:29:06.830 --> 06:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
my head and if that needs funding to fix
 
06:29:10.430 --> 06:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
it I have no choice to be on the street
 
06:29:15.590 --> 06:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
or all the Emergency Shelters and uh
 
06:29:18.470 --> 06:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
motels where they usually put up
 
06:29:22.730 --> 06:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
are full so in a situation like that
 
06:29:25.548 --> 06:29:25.558 align:start position:0%
this is something that would help to
 
06:29:28.368 --> 06:29:28.378 align:start position:0%
alleviate if I am the renter I'm the
 
06:29:30.890 --> 06:29:30.900 align:start position:0%
landlord I can't afford I've fallen
 
06:29:35.270 --> 06:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
under the uh what is the I can't fix up
 
06:29:38.090 --> 06:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
my rental property and but I don't want
 
06:29:42.170 --> 06:29:42.180 align:start position:0%
my rat talents to go because I can't fix
 
06:29:44.930 --> 06:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
it because of covet at least we have
 
06:29:47.390 --> 06:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
that opportunity this will help those
 
06:29:52.250 --> 06:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
this is an emergency housing assistance
 
06:29:54.830 --> 06:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
so I think they have to look at it and
 
06:29:57.948 --> 06:29:57.958 align:start position:0%
my other question also is we have there
 
06:30:02.628 --> 06:30:02.638 align:start position:0%
is a uh Amendment itl will not give us
 
06:30:06.650 --> 06:30:06.660 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to do that so isn't that
 
06:30:06.660 --> 06:30:07.970 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to do that so isn't that
uh

06:30:07.970 --> 06:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:30:11.868 --> 06:30:11.878 align:start position:0%
reverse of it that we look at it if it
 
06:30:15.470 --> 06:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't work then itl is the option I
 
06:30:17.510 --> 06:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to figure out how this
 
06:30:20.030 --> 06:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
whole process procedure is working
 
06:30:22.250 --> 06:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair sorry I'm I'm just so
 
06:30:24.948 --> 06:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
confused as to how let me see if I can
 
06:30:27.048 --> 06:30:27.058 align:start position:0%
help but under this scenario
 
06:30:30.288 --> 06:30:30.298 align:start position:0%
if the itl passes
 
06:30:34.010 --> 06:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
I'm sure given the comments we had this
 
06:30:36.048 --> 06:30:36.058 align:start position:0%
will be a very energetic conversation on
 
06:30:38.330 --> 06:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
the house floor and there will be an
 
06:30:40.730 --> 06:30:40.740 align:start position:0%
opportunity at that point to offer an
 
06:30:43.430 --> 06:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
amendment on the house floor and that so
 
06:30:45.350 --> 06:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
that that opportunity does not go away
 
06:30:47.288 --> 06:30:47.298 align:start position:0%
it just moves it to a different thing
 
06:30:50.270 --> 06:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
representative status you had a comment
 
06:30:54.650 --> 06:30:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:57.170 --> 06:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
two amendment to HB 284 before we
 
06:30:59.930 --> 06:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
considered the bill earlier today that's
 
06:31:02.930 --> 06:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
just a process thing process question so
 
06:31:04.490 --> 06:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
we have an amendment here but we're not
 
06:31:06.048 --> 06:31:06.058 align:start position:0%
considering it before the bill we're
 
06:31:12.788 --> 06:31:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:15.948 --> 06:31:15.958 align:start position:0%
the amendment was considered
 
06:31:19.670 --> 06:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
um in uh conjunction with the offending
 
06:31:22.390 --> 06:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
OTP uh
 
06:31:25.788 --> 06:31:25.798 align:start position:0%
emotion because you can't
 
06:31:28.548 --> 06:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
you can't amend something in an itl
 
06:31:31.250 --> 06:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
environment you only amend something in
 
06:31:33.830 --> 06:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
an OTC environment so I know that sounds
 
06:31:36.350 --> 06:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
a little confusing but uh it does in
 
06:31:41.030 --> 06:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
fact representative Porter uh had said
 
06:31:44.510 --> 06:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
that historically you take the motion to
 
06:31:47.628 --> 06:31:47.638 align:start position:0%
uh OTP first and then the amendment if
 
06:31:50.750 --> 06:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
you took if we followed that scenario uh
 
06:31:52.910 --> 06:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
if the motion was to ITP there is no
 
06:31:55.250 --> 06:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity to offer Amendment so either
 
06:31:57.830 --> 06:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
way uh we kind of stuck where we are
 
06:32:00.350 --> 06:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
right now so I'm sorry sorry please
 
06:32:06.470 --> 06:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:08.390 --> 06:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
important and and the wonderful job that
 
06:32:10.010 --> 06:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
his town is doing
 
06:32:12.470 --> 06:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
I chair the board of directors of the
 
06:32:14.570 --> 06:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
largest Social Service Agency in the
 
06:32:16.670 --> 06:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
Upper Valley we
 
06:32:19.310 --> 06:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
House people we feed people we keep them
 
06:32:22.788 --> 06:32:22.798 align:start position:0%
warm there are no Services here to do
 
06:32:25.310 --> 06:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
Building Inspections from our agency
 
06:32:27.948 --> 06:32:27.958 align:start position:0%
that just would it would never happen we
 
06:32:30.410 --> 06:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
don't have the capacity all this bill
 
06:32:32.868 --> 06:32:32.878 align:start position:0%
does representative air and and dear
 
06:32:36.288 --> 06:32:36.298 align:start position:0%
colleagues is prevent a municipality
 
06:32:39.650 --> 06:32:39.660 align:start position:0%
from refusing to provide the emergency
 
06:32:43.730 --> 06:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
assistance that is required by law
 
06:32:47.330 --> 06:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
based on a landlord or an owner's
 
06:32:49.910 --> 06:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
refusal to do a building inspection it
 
06:32:52.190 --> 06:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
does not create housing it does not
 
06:32:55.970 --> 06:32:55.980 align:start position:0%
create rat traps or tent cities it just
 
06:32:59.270 --> 06:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
ensures that the hosing the assistance
 
06:33:01.970 --> 06:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
that's required by law that there's no
 
06:33:05.750 --> 06:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
impediment to Distributing it and why on
 
06:33:05.760 --> 06:33:06.708 align:start position:0%
impediment to Distributing it and why on
Earth

06:33:06.708 --> 06:33:06.718 align:start position:0%
Earth
 
06:33:09.948 --> 06:33:09.958 align:start position:0%
that could be opposed when it is in the
 
06:33:11.990 --> 06:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
law in black and white that this
 
06:33:14.570 --> 06:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
emergency assistance is to be given is
 
06:33:17.090 --> 06:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
beyond me I'm sorry to be so emotional
 
06:33:19.368 --> 06:33:19.378 align:start position:0%
but it's just beyond me
 
06:33:25.010 --> 06:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:28.490 --> 06:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and um I mean my
 
06:33:30.708 --> 06:33:30.718 align:start position:0%

06:33:36.650 --> 06:33:36.660 align:start position:0%
um I truly do mean this in in in full
 
06:33:38.150 --> 06:33:38.160 align:start position:0%

06:33:40.368 --> 06:33:40.378 align:start position:0%
um shouldn't we be you know you
 
06:33:41.750 --> 06:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned something about that we could
 
06:33:43.788 --> 06:33:43.798 align:start position:0%
take this and fix it and do whatever on
 
06:33:46.070 --> 06:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
the floor but shouldn't the work be done
 
06:33:49.190 --> 06:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
in this committee and if we I tell it
 
06:33:51.948 --> 06:33:51.958 align:start position:0%
then we're not where we have we know
 
06:33:54.650 --> 06:33:54.660 align:start position:0%
that there's an amendment
 
06:33:55.788 --> 06:33:55.798 align:start position:0%
um out there
 
06:33:57.708 --> 06:33:57.718 align:start position:0%
um just ready to be discussed and talked
 
06:34:00.470 --> 06:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
and and possibly worked on
 
06:34:03.410 --> 06:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't it be best to to do that
 
06:34:05.510 --> 06:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
first rather than to send it down to the
 
06:34:07.610 --> 06:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
floor where for a hundred of us will
 
06:34:09.770 --> 06:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
have to learn and discuss et cetera et
 
06:34:11.208 --> 06:34:11.218 align:start position:0%
cetera and I don't and I mean no
 
06:34:12.830 --> 06:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
disrespect to my fellow colleagues on
 
06:34:14.750 --> 06:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
the floor either I just think the work
 
06:34:16.190 --> 06:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
should be done in the committee and
 
06:34:18.530 --> 06:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening thank you let me
 
06:34:20.810 --> 06:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
ask this we have a
 
06:34:23.150 --> 06:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
a representative on the committee that's
 
06:34:25.548 --> 06:34:25.558 align:start position:0%
made a motion to
 
06:34:28.430 --> 06:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
itl uh with the with that representative
 
06:34:30.948 --> 06:34:30.958 align:start position:0%

06:43:12.048 --> 06:43:12.058 align:start position:0%
pushed a number of things to the eighth
 
06:43:14.390 --> 06:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm just getting a little nervous
 
06:43:15.890 --> 06:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
that we're going to overload ourselves
 
06:43:18.650 --> 06:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
on the AIDS to be uh be working through
 
06:43:21.288 --> 06:43:21.298 align:start position:0%

06:43:39.770 --> 06:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
requiring a bond to be posted uh it's a
 
06:43:42.350 --> 06:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
playing board is going to be doing uh
 
06:43:44.690 --> 06:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
rather if the if the Builder does some
 
06:43:47.390 --> 06:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
significant changes
 
06:43:47.400 --> 06:43:48.708 align:start position:0%
significant changes
um

06:43:48.708 --> 06:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:52.670 --> 06:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:54.470 --> 06:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
if you want
 
06:43:54.480 --> 06:43:57.890 align:start position:0%
if you want
um

06:43:57.890 --> 06:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:59.570 --> 06:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
put your motion
 
06:44:02.628 --> 06:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
my motion is Ito
 
06:44:02.638 --> 06:44:04.010 align:start position:0%
my motion is Ito
second

06:44:04.010 --> 06:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
second
 
06:44:06.430 --> 06:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
okay then there's better motion
 
06:44:10.970 --> 06:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
and a second by representative Davis yes
 
06:44:14.690 --> 06:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:16.670 --> 06:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on the itl
 
06:44:19.730 --> 06:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
motion speak to my motion when I first
 
06:44:21.410 --> 06:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
read this bill to my husband who's the
 
06:44:23.930 --> 06:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
planning board uh chair here in town he
 
06:44:25.548 --> 06:44:25.558 align:start position:0%
thought it sounded pretty good but as I
 
06:44:27.230 --> 06:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
started listening to some of the
 
06:44:30.288 --> 06:44:30.298 align:start position:0%
objections that uh Mr Johnston had this
 
06:44:32.750 --> 06:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
morning I began to realize that
 
06:44:34.490 --> 06:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
this might be a good bill for planning
 
06:44:35.990 --> 06:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
board members but it might not be such a
 
06:44:37.368 --> 06:44:37.378 align:start position:0%
good bill for the members of the public
 
06:44:38.990 --> 06:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
who have an appeal that they would like
 
06:44:40.430 --> 06:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
to bring forward
 
06:44:41.990 --> 06:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
um it would cost them an awful lot of
 
06:44:43.368 --> 06:44:43.378 align:start position:0%
money and I think they have a right to
 
06:44:45.830 --> 06:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
that appeal to appeal a decision that
 
06:44:47.750 --> 06:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
the planning board has made and it
 
06:44:49.850 --> 06:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
shouldn't end up costing them two or
 
06:44:52.250 --> 06:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars to do that so I
 
06:44:53.628 --> 06:44:53.638 align:start position:0%
think this bill just isn't ready for
 
06:44:56.150 --> 06:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
prime time yet and emotions been made
 
06:44:58.368 --> 06:44:58.378 align:start position:0%

06:45:18.850 --> 06:45:18.860 align:start position:0%

have to be sent to me I approve them
 
06:49:14.330 --> 06:49:14.340 align:start position:0%
or disapprove them and then they they uh
 
06:49:16.310 --> 06:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
once they're approved they're included
 
06:49:17.510 --> 06:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the
 
06:49:20.690 --> 06:49:20.700 align:start position:0%

06:49:36.890 --> 06:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
when they are considered gone if you

the time frames we're working with uh
 
06:49:45.650 --> 06:49:45.660 align:start position:0%

06:49:50.208 --> 06:49:50.218 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday
 
06:49:52.548 --> 06:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
some of them before then but no later
 
06:49:54.468 --> 06:49:54.478 align:start position:0%
than Tuesday that's that's where our
 
06:49:55.548 --> 06:49:55.558 align:start position:0%
goal is
 
06:49:57.110 --> 06:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh we're also going to we're going to
 
06:49:58.968 --> 06:49:58.978 align:start position:0%
miss the calendar I understand the

06:50:04.910 --> 06:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
extend some of the deadlines but I I
 
06:50:07.250 --> 06:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
haven't heard directly what that means
 
06:50:09.288 --> 06:50:09.298 align:start position:0%
and which deadlines are extended so we
 
06:50:12.830 --> 06:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
may have more time but given the current
 
06:50:14.810 --> 06:50:14.820 align:start position:0%
calendar deadlines that we have without
 
06:50:17.448 --> 06:50:17.458 align:start position:0%
the speakers intervention today
 
06:50:20.030 --> 06:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
I suspect that all our folders will be
 
06:50:21.650 --> 06:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
transmitted no later than I would say
 
06:50:24.890 --> 06:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
lunchtime on on Tuesday
 
06:50:24.900 --> 06:50:29.150 align:start position:0%
lunchtime on on Tuesday
okay

06:50:29.150 --> 06:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:31.968 --> 06:50:31.978 align:start position:0%
that's uh Mr chair
 
06:50:33.708 --> 06:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
are you thinking about reconsideration
 
06:50:35.270 --> 06:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
that process
 
06:50:37.850 --> 06:50:37.860 align:start position:0%
I'm just thinking some days it's a few
 
06:50:40.070 --> 06:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
days some days it's over two weeks so
 
06:50:42.170 --> 06:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to wrap my head around
 
06:50:45.170 --> 06:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
what the process is in this committee I
 
06:50:47.690 --> 06:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
know I'm a newbie I'm first time on this
 
06:50:49.788 --> 06:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
committee I don't know the workings of
 
06:50:53.150 --> 06:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
it I can tell you that when we we're not
 
06:50:54.890 --> 06:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
up against the deadlines
 
06:50:56.930 --> 06:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
and when we're still learning our
 
06:50:59.810 --> 06:50:59.820 align:start position:0%
process which many of us have been this
 
06:51:01.788 --> 06:51:01.798 align:start position:0%
term we've been a little slow to
 
06:51:04.850 --> 06:51:04.860 align:start position:0%
transmit a lot of these folders as we as
 
06:51:07.190 --> 06:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
we complete new paperwork that the
 
06:51:08.990 --> 06:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
clerk's office has asked us to complete
 
06:51:10.310 --> 06:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
in some cases we don't know the
 
06:51:11.930 --> 06:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
paperwork has to be completed until
 
06:51:15.708 --> 06:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
after the bill is done and so it comes
 
06:51:17.868 --> 06:51:17.878 align:start position:0%
back and we finish it and then we send
 
06:51:19.430 --> 06:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
it Forward we're getting a little bit
 
06:51:22.788 --> 06:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
better and our learning curve is is uh
 
06:51:25.490 --> 06:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
is being capitalized on so we're a
 
06:51:26.990 --> 06:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
little fast enough and the fact that
 
06:51:28.430 --> 06:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
we're up against the deadline we're
 
06:51:32.510 --> 06:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
being uh a little quicker also so uh you
 
06:51:33.590 --> 06:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
can't hear me
 
06:51:35.448 --> 06:51:35.458 align:start position:0%
can you guys hear me are you just making
 
06:51:38.570 --> 06:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
fun of me no we're not making funny I'm
 
06:51:40.548 --> 06:51:40.558 align:start position:0%
saying goodbye to just to representative
 
06:51:45.350 --> 06:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:47.868 --> 06:51:47.878 align:start position:0%
I have fans so and we were we were
 
06:51:49.850 --> 06:51:49.860 align:start position:0%
making fun of each other because we were
 
06:51:52.690 --> 06:51:52.700 align:start position:0%
waving at each other
 
06:51:56.510 --> 06:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
our apologies Mr chair okay but I can
 
06:51:58.190 --> 06:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
tell you just if you're getting ready to
 
06:52:00.048 --> 06:52:00.058 align:start position:0%
leave the last two actions we have is
 
06:52:02.448 --> 06:52:02.458 align:start position:0%
House Bill 67 and
 
06:52:05.930 --> 06:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
House Bill 431 so if you want if you
 
06:52:08.690 --> 06:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
want to hold on for those two it might
 
06:52:11.990 --> 06:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
be fast but uh I have a meeting I have a
 
06:52:13.490 --> 06:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
meeting I have to open at four o'clock
 
06:52:16.490 --> 06:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
so I have to go I'm really sorry and
 
06:52:18.350 --> 06:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
representative true 11 has to go get her
 
06:52:20.690 --> 06:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
second vaccine shot

saying oh we'll be done long before then
 
06:52:33.110 --> 06:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
anyway in any case I do have to go and
 
06:52:35.390 --> 06:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
and again I'm sorry that representative
 
06:52:37.930 --> 06:52:37.940 align:start position:0%

06:53:04.850 --> 06:53:04.860 align:start position:0%
and right now we're looking to
 
06:53:04.860 --> 06:53:07.448 align:start position:0%
and right now we're looking to
exec

06:53:07.448 --> 06:53:07.458 align:start position:0%

06:53:11.750 --> 06:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
573-574 and 588 on Monday that's that's
 
06:53:13.548 --> 06:53:13.558 align:start position:0%
the plan
 
06:53:16.850 --> 06:53:16.860 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:53:19.250 --> 06:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
so what's up Nick what's up next is
 
06:53:23.230 --> 06:53:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:25.968 --> 06:53:25.978 align:start position:0%
we have uh I believe we have an
 
06:53:28.430 --> 06:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
amendment for that bill as well so I'll
 
06:53:30.110 --> 06:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
be looking for a motion on the amendment
 
06:53:30.120 --> 06:53:31.250 align:start position:0%
be looking for a motion on the amendment
and

06:53:31.250 --> 06:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:53:36.410 --> 06:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:39.288 --> 06:53:39.298 align:start position:0%
that if representative Porter
 
06:53:42.110 --> 06:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
would like to uh see it's out a little
 
06:53:44.208 --> 06:53:44.218 align:start position:0%
differently I'm okay with that if we
 
06:53:46.490 --> 06:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to just take a motion on the bill
 
06:53:48.410 --> 06:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
first and then we'll consider the
 
06:53:50.810 --> 06:53:50.820 align:start position:0%
amendment afterwards how's that sound
 
06:53:53.270 --> 06:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
I'm confused Mr chair I really am and
 
06:53:53.280 --> 06:53:54.288 align:start position:0%
I'm confused Mr chair I really am and
how

06:53:54.288 --> 06:53:54.298 align:start position:0%
how
 
06:53:56.628 --> 06:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
we had to make the motion
 
06:53:59.510 --> 06:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
of ought to pass and then move the
 
06:54:01.190 --> 06:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
amendment so the amendment went along
 
06:54:03.288 --> 06:54:03.298 align:start position:0%
with the ought to pass motion that's
 
06:54:04.850 --> 06:54:04.860 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do this time okay
 
06:54:07.010 --> 06:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much because I don't and
 
06:54:08.330 --> 06:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
I don't have I don't know if I have the
 
06:54:10.670 --> 06:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
amendment okay
 
06:54:13.250 --> 06:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
um we can read it to you if you don't
 
06:54:14.570 --> 06:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
have it
 
06:54:14.580 --> 06:54:15.650 align:start position:0%
have it
um

06:54:15.650 --> 06:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:54:17.030 --> 06:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
I think it was sent to the whole
 
06:54:18.650 --> 06:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
committee but it might be buried in your
 
06:54:20.890 --> 06:54:20.900 align:start position:0%
email and I I that's
 
06:54:25.070 --> 06:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
quite a bit so the uh which Bill are we
 
06:54:26.990 --> 06:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
talking about it was about Animal

06:59:12.420 --> 06:59:14.448 align:start position:0%
 
this

06:59:14.448 --> 06:59:14.458 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:59:16.670 --> 06:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that every time I've
 
06:59:18.830 --> 06:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
serve the four or five terms I've served
 
06:59:20.990 --> 06:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
on this committee we've had an issue
 
06:59:21.000 --> 06:59:22.310 align:start position:0%
on this committee we've had an issue
with

06:59:22.310 --> 06:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:59:24.708 --> 06:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
towns that use the official ballot or
 
06:59:27.170 --> 06:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
the sb2 method
 
06:59:31.010 --> 06:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
the original intent of sb2 was to allow
 
06:59:35.390 --> 06:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
everybody that wanted to to vote by
 
06:59:38.930 --> 06:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
ballot on the town issues
 
06:59:42.548 --> 06:59:42.558 align:start position:0%
because they said people couldn't get to
 
06:59:45.310 --> 06:59:45.320 align:start position:0%
the town meetings it was
 
06:59:49.730 --> 06:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
disenfranchising old people families Etc
 
06:59:52.968 --> 06:59:52.978 align:start position:0%
so the best solution was to have this be
 
06:59:54.830 --> 06:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
on a ballot that everybody could vote on
 
06:59:56.810 --> 06:59:56.820 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday or Saturday or whenever it
 
06:59:59.570 --> 06:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
was held but in order to continue the
 
07:00:01.310 --> 07:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
07:00:03.170 --> 07:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
self-roove that we like to have in New
 
07:00:05.690 --> 07:00:05.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the town meeting self-rule we
 
07:00:08.510 --> 07:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
needed to have a Time the delay when the
 
07:00:10.490 --> 07:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
members of the public could come in and
 
07:00:12.410 --> 07:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
hear from the Selectmen or the school
 
07:00:15.410 --> 07:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
board and ask their questions and amend
 
07:00:18.350 --> 07:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
things that would go on about you this
 
07:00:20.510 --> 07:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
used to be done at the town meeting but
 
07:00:22.010 --> 07:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
because of the way things would change
 
07:00:24.230 --> 07:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
for sb2 it now went to deliberative
 
07:00:27.350 --> 07:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
sessions now the complaint is that at
 
07:00:29.090 --> 07:00:29.100 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions only a few people
 
07:00:31.788 --> 07:00:31.798 align:start position:0%
go and they and it's not fair because
 
07:00:34.010 --> 07:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
people don't come out you know the only
 
07:00:37.570 --> 07:00:37.580 align:start position:0%
the people that want something show up
 
07:00:41.810 --> 07:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
the problem that we have here isn't
 
07:00:41.820 --> 07:00:43.910 align:start position:0%
the problem that we have here isn't
it

07:00:43.910 --> 07:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:47.410 --> 07:00:47.420 align:start position:0%
the problem it seems to me the problem
 
07:00:50.030 --> 07:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
that is the problem is that people don't
 
07:00:52.310 --> 07:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
come to our meetings so if you're really
 
07:00:53.990 --> 07:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
interested in something you'll go to the
 
07:00:55.310 --> 07:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
meeting if you're not really interested
 
07:00:56.868 --> 07:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
you don't go to the meeting so the
 
07:00:58.310 --> 07:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
people that show up are the ones that
 
07:00:59.628 --> 07:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
have the control
 
07:01:01.070 --> 07:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
07:01:03.650 --> 07:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
a petition a petition Warren article
 
07:01:05.330 --> 07:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
that comes before a deliberative session
 
07:01:07.548 --> 07:01:07.558 align:start position:0%
gets deliberated by the people of the
 
07:01:10.490 --> 07:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
town and they change it just like they
 
07:01:12.468 --> 07:01:12.478 align:start position:0%
would have done at the town meeting they
 
07:01:14.810 --> 07:01:14.820 align:start position:0%
could change it but instead of voting at
 
07:01:16.610 --> 07:01:16.620 align:start position:0%
it at the deliberative session it goes
 
07:01:18.890 --> 07:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
on the ballot now if someone is in a
 
07:01:21.288 --> 07:01:21.298 align:start position:0%
traditional town meeting and someone has
 
07:01:23.150 --> 07:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
brought a petition warrant article and
 
07:01:25.670 --> 07:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
it gets amended it only gets voted on
 
07:01:27.650 --> 07:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
once at the town meeting
 
07:01:29.930 --> 07:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow people to have
 
07:01:33.410 --> 07:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
their petition Warren article debated at
 
07:01:35.510 --> 07:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
the deliberative session amended at the
 
07:01:37.788 --> 07:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
deliberative session but then the
 
07:01:40.250 --> 07:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
original warrant article goes on valid
 
07:01:42.350 --> 07:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
it's not fair it's not the way the
 
07:01:46.430 --> 07:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
process works and and to have two
 
07:01:48.948 --> 07:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
items on the ballot the original warrant
 
07:01:51.770 --> 07:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
article in the amended warrant article
 
07:01:53.930 --> 07:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
it's confusing to the voters if they
 
07:01:57.310 --> 07:01:57.320 align:start position:0%
both win what happens I it's just
 
07:02:01.368 --> 07:02:01.378 align:start position:0%
misusing the process of what sb2 was
 
07:02:05.330 --> 07:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
designed to do so in every term we have
 
07:02:07.310 --> 07:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
this issue and every term we have to
 
07:02:10.490 --> 07:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
explain again why it's not fair that
 
07:02:12.830 --> 07:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
some people get to vote have theoretical
 
07:02:16.430 --> 07:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
voted on twice and other people don't so
 
07:02:18.530 --> 07:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
I'm just really against things that are
 
07:02:20.410 --> 07:02:20.420 align:start position:0%
changing how warrant articles are done
 
07:02:23.090 --> 07:02:23.100 align:start position:0%
at town meeting or deliberative session
 
07:02:25.910 --> 07:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
it has to be consistent throughout the
 
07:02:27.410 --> 07:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
state well not addressing the question
 
07:02:30.468 --> 07:02:30.478 align:start position:0%
of fairness I can't tell you one answer
 
07:02:32.750 --> 07:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
to your question if both if both the
 
07:02:35.208 --> 07:02:35.218 align:start position:0%
amended article and the original article
 
07:02:37.730 --> 07:02:37.740 align:start position:0%
both passed then the amended article is
 
07:02:39.530 --> 07:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
what's adopted well how do you know what
 
07:02:41.208 --> 07:02:41.218 align:start position:0%
people want then
 
07:02:44.690 --> 07:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
but then they want both of them
 
07:02:47.270 --> 07:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
well uh if they if they both pass they
 
07:02:48.830 --> 07:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
only get one
 
07:02:51.468 --> 07:02:51.478 align:start position:0%
they get the amended one
 
07:02:53.150 --> 07:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
that's the way the legislation is
 
07:02:55.610 --> 07:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
written yes I can't I'm not arguing in
 
07:02:56.750 --> 07:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
favor of the legislation I'm just
 
07:03:01.610 --> 07:03:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:04.368 --> 07:03:04.378 align:start position:0%
any further discussion before we take a
 
07:03:04.378 --> 07:03:05.270 align:start position:0%
any further discussion before we take a
vote

07:03:05.270 --> 07:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
vote
 
07:03:07.910 --> 07:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
we have a comment from
 
07:03:09.830 --> 07:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp
 
07:03:09.840 --> 07:03:12.288 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp
uh

07:03:12.288 --> 07:03:12.298 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:03:17.628 --> 07:03:17.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:20.570 --> 07:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
the new amendments they don't they don't
 
07:03:22.250 --> 07:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
realize that uh
 
07:03:25.610 --> 07:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
the original bill is replaced entirely
 
07:03:30.170 --> 07:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:32.930 --> 07:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
the uh the bill which would have put the
 
07:03:32.940 --> 07:03:35.090 align:start position:0%
the uh the bill which would have put the
original

07:03:35.090 --> 07:03:35.100 align:start position:0%
original
 
07:03:37.788 --> 07:03:37.798 align:start position:0%
petition or an article on the ballot
 
07:03:41.708 --> 07:03:41.718 align:start position:0%
it's gone and it's replaced with the
 
07:03:44.750 --> 07:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
amendment which says no petition or an
 
07:03:48.530 --> 07:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
article shall be amended to change
 
07:03:53.628 --> 07:03:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:56.270 --> 07:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
two balance
 
07:03:56.280 --> 07:03:59.030 align:start position:0%
two balance
yeah

07:03:59.030 --> 07:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:01.490 --> 07:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chair can I ask you a question
 
07:04:07.788 --> 07:04:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:10.670 --> 07:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
the representative Tripp just said that
 
07:04:12.530 --> 07:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
I thought
 
07:04:14.868 --> 07:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
I thought that both amendments get put
 
07:04:16.430 --> 07:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
on an article
 
07:04:16.440 --> 07:04:21.250 align:start position:0%
on an article
sentence

07:04:21.250 --> 07:04:21.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:24.048 --> 07:04:24.058 align:start position:0%
did the amendment replace the original
 
07:04:24.058 --> 07:04:26.570 align:start position:0%
did the amendment replace the original
bid

07:04:26.570 --> 07:04:26.580 align:start position:0%
bid
 
07:04:32.468 --> 07:04:32.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:45.288 --> 07:04:45.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:52.788 --> 07:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:54.590 --> 07:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
so just so you can hear what we're
 
07:04:56.448 --> 07:04:56.458 align:start position:0%
talking about we're looking at the
 
07:04:56.458 --> 07:04:57.530 align:start position:0%
talking about we're looking at the
original

07:04:57.530 --> 07:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
original
 
07:05:00.288 --> 07:05:00.298 align:start position:0%
Bill paragraph d
 
07:05:03.048 --> 07:05:03.058 align:start position:0%
and the amended the amendment which is a
 
07:05:05.270 --> 07:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
which takes the original D out and puts
 
07:05:10.990 --> 07:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:13.250 --> 07:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:05:15.288 --> 07:05:15.298 align:start position:0%
would it be possible Mr chair to have
 
07:05:17.510 --> 07:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
them speak into the microphone just for
 
07:05:17.520 --> 07:05:19.548 align:start position:0%
them speak into the microphone just for
91a

07:05:19.548 --> 07:05:19.558 align:start position:0%
91a
 
07:05:22.490 --> 07:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
yes uh I'm sorry the uh
 
07:05:24.890 --> 07:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
the question that we're wrestling about
 
07:05:28.010 --> 07:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
is looking at the original
 
07:05:32.868 --> 07:05:32.878 align:start position:0%
Phil 67 section D which talks about uh
 
07:05:36.590 --> 07:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
both amended and the uh
 
07:05:38.448 --> 07:05:38.458 align:start position:0%
article in the original article both
 
07:05:40.850 --> 07:05:40.860 align:start position:0%
being on the ballot that that was my
 
07:05:43.190 --> 07:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
understanding and I and as I've now
 
07:05:45.770 --> 07:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment it looks like
 
07:05:47.750 --> 07:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
that whole paragraph has been stricken
 
07:05:50.270 --> 07:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
as as representative Tripp just
 
07:05:52.730 --> 07:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
mentioned and it's replaced with the
 
07:05:54.890 --> 07:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
fact that no petition worn article shall
 
07:05:58.010 --> 07:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
be amended to change its specific intent
 
07:06:00.530 --> 07:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
so both articles do not appear on the
 
07:06:03.170 --> 07:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
warrant and the the only article that
 
07:06:05.270 --> 07:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
will appear on the warrant is is the
 
07:06:07.430 --> 07:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
original or the amended article without
 
07:06:10.430 --> 07:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
changing the specific intent of the
 
07:06:17.530 --> 07:06:17.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:21.288 --> 07:06:21.298 align:start position:0%
I don't have the amendment can it be
 
07:06:23.750 --> 07:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
emailed or I'm voting on something that
 
07:06:27.410 --> 07:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
I have no copy of it okay I I think it
 
07:06:28.910 --> 07:06:28.920 align:start position:0%

07:06:31.850 --> 07:06:31.860 align:start position:0%

closer to what I had heard so it may
 
07:08:21.530 --> 07:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
make a little less sense right now but
 
07:08:24.170 --> 07:08:24.180 align:start position:0%

uh representative Tripp has been having
 
07:08:37.670 --> 07:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
trouble getting my attention here in the
 
07:08:39.590 --> 07:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
LLB when he wants to ask a question so
 
07:08:41.990 --> 07:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
he brought a little cowbell with him to
 
07:08:45.230 --> 07:08:45.240 align:start position:0%

07:08:47.270 --> 07:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
helpful to know thank you

the third season cheers attention as
 
07:08:54.948 --> 07:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
much as the people that are on to right
 
07:08:57.110 --> 07:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
the the folks in the LLB don't have an
 
07:08:58.190 --> 07:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to raise their hand
 
07:09:01.128 --> 07:09:01.138 align:start position:0%
electronically and sometimes as I am
 
07:09:03.890 --> 07:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
becoming hypnotized by my screen I don't
 
07:09:03.900 --> 07:09:04.788 align:start position:0%

07:09:37.490 --> 07:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
I apologize Mr chair I I um I was going
 
07:09:39.288 --> 07:09:39.298 align:start position:0%
to this very point and forgot to raise
 
07:09:41.090 --> 07:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
my or forgot to lower my hand about
 
07:09:42.890 --> 07:09:42.900 align:start position:0%
having this complete change to the
 
07:09:44.810 --> 07:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you okay representative
 
07:09:44.820 --> 07:09:48.170 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you okay representative
Porter

07:09:48.170 --> 07:09:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:51.468 --> 07:09:51.478 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair I'm feeling uncomfortable
 
07:09:51.478 --> 07:09:52.368 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair I'm feeling uncomfortable
now

07:09:52.368 --> 07:09:52.378 align:start position:0%
now
 
07:09:55.670 --> 07:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
um because I don't believe that the
 
07:09:58.128 --> 07:09:58.138 align:start position:0%
changes that this makes we've had a
 
07:09:59.868 --> 07:09:59.878 align:start position:0%
chance to hear from any members of the
 
07:10:03.350 --> 07:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
public on this change because this is a
 
07:10:06.110 --> 07:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
significant change
 
07:10:07.850 --> 07:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
um and and I'm
 
07:10:10.368 --> 07:10:10.378 align:start position:0%
I'm just uncomfortable so I will
 
07:10:12.468 --> 07:10:12.478 align:start position:0%
probably be voting against Dr pass as
 
07:10:13.850 --> 07:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
amended because
 
07:10:16.430 --> 07:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not comfortable that we heard what
 
07:10:18.708 --> 07:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
this amendment actually does I
 
07:10:18.718 --> 07:10:20.110 align:start position:0%
this amendment actually does I
understand

07:10:20.110 --> 07:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
understand
 
07:10:22.610 --> 07:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it just was a long time ago
 
07:10:24.890 --> 07:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
that we heard this bill and I I know
 
07:10:26.448 --> 07:10:26.458 align:start position:0%
it's been a while a normal process
 
07:10:28.610 --> 07:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
however is that we don't go to the
 
07:10:31.430 --> 07:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
public during executive session I know I
 
07:10:34.250 --> 07:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
know this bill is now our bill it's no
 
07:10:37.850 --> 07:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
longer the sponsors bill and we can
 
07:10:40.968 --> 07:10:40.978 align:start position:0%
change it as we see fit uh if you don't
 
07:10:42.770 --> 07:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable with this change you
 
07:10:45.048 --> 07:10:45.058 align:start position:0%
should vote against it
 
07:10:50.590 --> 07:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:53.570 --> 07:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
we took a vote on the amendment and the
 
07:10:55.490 --> 07:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
amendment passed ten to seven and we're
 
07:10:58.368 --> 07:10:58.378 align:start position:0%
about to take a vote on the bill uh as
 
07:10:58.378 --> 07:10:59.448 align:start position:0%
about to take a vote on the bill uh as
amended

07:10:59.448 --> 07:10:59.458 align:start position:0%
amended
 
07:11:01.850 --> 07:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
okay that's amended
 
07:11:04.010 --> 07:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
any further discussion before we go in
 
07:11:07.548 --> 07:11:07.558 align:start position:0%
the voting Mr chair yes
 
07:11:09.110 --> 07:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
I would just like to speak to the
 
07:11:12.110 --> 07:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that in my view this amendment
 
07:11:15.590 --> 07:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
simply clarifies but is already in
 
07:11:15.600 --> 07:11:17.390 align:start position:0%
simply clarifies but is already in
statute

07:11:17.390 --> 07:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
statute
 
07:11:21.110 --> 07:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
so there is no significant um
 
07:11:24.048 --> 07:11:24.058 align:start position:0%
change that's that's being made with
 
07:11:26.208 --> 07:11:26.218 align:start position:0%
this amendment to you know within this
 
07:11:30.830 --> 07:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
bill it just clarifies existing language
 
07:11:30.840 --> 07:11:36.530 align:start position:0%
bill it just clarifies existing language
uh

07:11:36.530 --> 07:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:39.350 --> 07:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
dick are you good no I I do have a
 
07:11:40.490 --> 07:11:40.500 align:start position:0%

07:11:43.070 --> 07:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
um uh if I may Mr chair wait a wait a
 
07:11:44.390 --> 07:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
sec we had I was recognizing
 
07:11:48.350 --> 07:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry I'm sorry yeah
 
07:11:52.610 --> 07:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
but the original discussion on the the
 
07:11:57.410 --> 07:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:59.930 --> 07:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
the delivery session was held in a
 
07:12:02.090 --> 07:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
location that was difficult for the
 
07:12:03.530 --> 07:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
majority of the people in the school
 
07:12:07.070 --> 07:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
district to get to and uh
 
07:12:08.690 --> 07:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
what would happen in the delivery
 
07:12:11.530 --> 07:12:11.540 align:start position:0%
session as uh representative Porter
 
07:12:14.930 --> 07:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
said earlier this
 
07:12:17.628 --> 07:12:17.638 align:start position:0%
is amended and changed to where the uh
 
07:12:22.010 --> 07:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
the intent was negated entirely
 
07:12:22.020 --> 07:12:23.570 align:start position:0%
the intent was negated entirely
uh

07:12:23.570 --> 07:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:12:26.690 --> 07:12:26.700 align:start position:0%
the solution that the sponsor
 
07:12:26.700 --> 07:12:28.610 align:start position:0%
the solution that the sponsor
uh

07:12:28.610 --> 07:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:12:31.190 --> 07:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
that would work was to keep
 
07:12:37.430 --> 07:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:37.440 --> 07:12:39.350 align:start position:0%
 
uh

07:12:39.350 --> 07:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:12:42.350 --> 07:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
so both of those on the ballots uh
 
07:12:44.750 --> 07:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
during the hearings it was discussed
 
07:12:46.250 --> 07:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
that that would be confusing to people
 
07:12:50.090 --> 07:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't know what what was uh
 
07:12:55.090 --> 07:12:55.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:59.208 --> 07:12:59.218 align:start position:0%
I was asked to look at this and uh
 
07:12:59.218 --> 07:13:00.350 align:start position:0%
I was asked to look at this and uh
percent

07:13:00.350 --> 07:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
percent
 
07:13:03.910 --> 07:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the effect solution
 
07:13:06.170 --> 07:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
this is
 
07:13:09.468 --> 07:13:09.478 align:start position:0%
not a DC solution but uh what I finally
 
07:13:12.650 --> 07:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
come up with is I said well
 
07:13:14.830 --> 07:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
we'll find out
 
07:13:17.868 --> 07:13:17.878 align:start position:0%
if the wording that I've suggested in
 
07:13:21.650 --> 07:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
the amendment is acceptable too
 
07:13:23.990 --> 07:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
committing it to the uh
 
07:13:27.530 --> 07:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
house on the floor so I spent at the
 
07:13:33.170 --> 07:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:36.410 --> 07:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative
 
07:13:38.090 --> 07:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
07:13:39.968 --> 07:13:39.978 align:start position:0%
um I want to thank representative Tripp
 
07:13:42.830 --> 07:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
because I love this amendment I mean I
 
07:13:46.128 --> 07:13:46.138 align:start position:0%
love the idea as a board member of nhma
 
07:13:49.010 --> 07:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
and a selectman for the last 100 years
 
07:13:50.750 --> 07:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
that I've been
 
07:13:53.448 --> 07:13:53.458 align:start position:0%
um I I can I can promise you and if
 
07:13:55.010 --> 07:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
Cordell was on the line he would he
 
07:13:57.830 --> 07:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
would confirm and if Steve Buckley and
 
07:13:59.448 --> 07:13:59.458 align:start position:0%
Nate Graves is on the line they would
 
07:14:01.968 --> 07:14:01.978 align:start position:0%
confirm from legal that one of the
 
07:14:04.670 --> 07:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
biggest questions that that we get is
 
07:14:08.030 --> 07:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
can we change the intent you know can we
 
07:14:10.250 --> 07:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
make the police car a fire truck can we
 
07:14:12.048 --> 07:14:12.058 align:start position:0%
make the police car red instead of blue
 
07:14:15.410 --> 07:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
so intent I I mean this this if you say
 
07:14:16.968 --> 07:14:16.978 align:start position:0%
you can't change the intent I'm all in
 
07:14:20.448 --> 07:14:20.458 align:start position:0%
favor of this however that said this is
 
07:14:22.730 --> 07:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
a completely different Bill than what
 
07:14:25.850 --> 07:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
was submitted and what we discussed in
 
07:14:28.368 --> 07:14:28.378 align:start position:0%
the public hearing so I I am I am
 
07:14:30.410 --> 07:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
totally torn I love the idea and I want
 
07:14:34.430 --> 07:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
to vote in favor of it but if it's just
 
07:14:36.770 --> 07:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
not what was submitted to the public and
 
07:14:38.330 --> 07:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
I I just don't know what we're supposed
 
07:14:39.830 --> 07:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
to do in that instance I know the bill
 
07:14:42.468 --> 07:14:42.478 align:start position:0%
is ours I understand that but the public
 
07:14:45.350 --> 07:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
did not weigh in on the amendment on on
 
07:14:47.448 --> 07:14:47.458 align:start position:0%
this on this on the on the dramatic
 
07:14:49.128 --> 07:14:49.138 align:start position:0%
change to the amendment and I have to
 
07:14:51.610 --> 07:14:51.620 align:start position:0%
voice my concern in that respect
 
07:14:56.150 --> 07:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
I think my explanation uh
 
07:14:58.548 --> 07:14:58.558 align:start position:0%
to the public is that
 
07:15:01.670 --> 07:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
that once we uh once we have the bill
 
07:15:05.628 --> 07:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
and then it goes from the uh
 
07:15:07.730 --> 07:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and the originator of the
 
07:15:10.430 --> 07:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
bill to the committee's bill and and
 
07:15:12.530 --> 07:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
once we're in executive session then
 
07:15:14.750 --> 07:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
it's up to us to decide if we want to
 
07:15:17.270 --> 07:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
edit or change the bill and that's what
 
07:15:20.150 --> 07:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
one of our one of our members committee
 
07:15:22.250 --> 07:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
members did and it's brought back an
 
07:15:24.288 --> 07:15:24.298 align:start position:0%
amendment to change the change the bill
 
07:15:26.628 --> 07:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
that was brought forth and debated
 
07:15:29.270 --> 07:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
in the hearing process if you don't
 
07:15:29.280 --> 07:15:30.770 align:start position:0%
in the hearing process if you don't
believe

07:15:30.770 --> 07:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
believe
 
07:15:33.830 --> 07:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
that we should be doing this because of
 
07:15:35.990 --> 07:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
the content and the fact of the public
 
07:15:38.330 --> 07:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
hearing and so forth then I would
 
07:15:40.570 --> 07:15:40.580 align:start position:0%
encourage you to vote your conscience
 
07:15:43.310 --> 07:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
going forward but it is certainly within
 
07:15:44.770 --> 07:15:44.780 align:start position:0%
our process
 
07:15:47.570 --> 07:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
to take control of the bill and then
 
07:15:50.530 --> 07:15:50.540 align:start position:0%
edit it to what the committee would like
 
07:15:53.030 --> 07:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you without without further
 
07:15:53.040 --> 07:15:54.048 align:start position:0%
thank you without without further

07:19:06.948 --> 07:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
uh the discussion this representative
 
07:19:06.958 --> 07:19:09.770 align:start position:0%
uh the discussion this representative
Porter

07:19:09.770 --> 07:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:12.650 --> 07:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um
 
07:19:15.650 --> 07:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
standing tradition in this committee to
 
07:19:18.170 --> 07:19:18.180 align:start position:0%
not pass legislation to solve a
 
07:19:20.810 --> 07:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
Personnel problem in one small community
 
07:19:23.330 --> 07:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
so I'm just putting that out there for
 
07:19:25.730 --> 07:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
you to consider when it's time to Recon
 
07:19:28.968 --> 07:19:28.978 align:start position:0%
if this Bill gets retained um because
 
07:19:31.910 --> 07:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
mediation is an option that they have
 
07:19:34.850 --> 07:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
and we don't usually serve that function
 
07:19:37.788 --> 07:19:37.798 align:start position:0%
and if I remember correctly last year we
 
07:19:39.830 --> 07:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
had a bill that came from Hopkinton
 
07:19:43.850 --> 07:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
about a town clerk issue and we would
 
07:19:45.468 --> 07:19:45.478 align:start position:0%
not deal with the town clerk issue
 
07:19:47.830 --> 07:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
because that's up to the voters
 
07:19:50.690 --> 07:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
so just letting you
 
07:19:52.430 --> 07:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
think about that
 
07:19:54.770 --> 07:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you I I don't
 
07:19:57.770 --> 07:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
disagree with you on that representative
 
07:20:00.650 --> 07:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm I'm just like to
 
07:20:03.230 --> 07:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
uh put the question out as to
 
07:20:05.990 --> 07:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
what if we retain and we're going to
 
07:20:07.610 --> 07:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
work on this so if there's going to be
 
07:20:09.948 --> 07:20:09.958 align:start position:0%
work what is the work the bill is CL it
 
07:20:11.750 --> 07:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
seems clear to me I'm just looking for
 
07:20:14.390 --> 07:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
why I would vote in favor of of
 
07:20:18.230 --> 07:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
retaining this bill because again it
 
07:20:21.170 --> 07:20:21.180 align:start position:0%
it's perfectly clear what what the
 
07:20:23.390 --> 07:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
intent is
 
07:20:25.788 --> 07:20:25.798 align:start position:0%
okay that's that's a good question I I
 
07:20:28.128 --> 07:20:28.138 align:start position:0%
let me I don't speak on behalf of the
 
07:20:30.650 --> 07:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
committee but I would say that if I were
 
07:20:32.390 --> 07:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
to vote for retain it would be to get
 
07:20:32.400 --> 07:20:34.490 align:start position:0%
to vote for retain it would be to get
the

07:20:34.490 --> 07:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:20:37.010 --> 07:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
give the community an opportunity to
 
07:20:39.288 --> 07:20:39.298 align:start position:0%
work this out this is kind of a dirty
 
07:20:41.868 --> 07:20:41.878 align:start position:0%
laundry issue uh work it out and
 
07:20:46.750 --> 07:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh they can decide either to
 
07:20:49.850 --> 07:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
change the legislation with an amendment
 
07:20:51.530 --> 07:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
07:20:54.230 --> 07:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
or if it comes back to us in an
 
07:20:58.070 --> 07:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
unchanged uh manner I think I would be
 
07:20:59.930 --> 07:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
on an itl side of this
 
07:21:02.030 --> 07:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative Gilman you had a
 
07:21:03.590 --> 07:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
comment foreign
 
07:21:06.468 --> 07:21:06.478 align:start position:0%
yes along with going along the lines of
 
07:21:08.868 --> 07:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
what you just said Mr chair
 
07:21:11.390 --> 07:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
um if a position has been created as an
 
07:21:13.250 --> 07:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
elected official wouldn't the
 
07:21:15.590 --> 07:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
legislative body have to be the ones
 
07:21:18.530 --> 07:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
that decide if it's uh elected or not
 
07:21:20.208 --> 07:21:20.218 align:start position:0%
for their particular Town wouldn't they
 
07:21:22.850 --> 07:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
have to resend or repeal that position
 
07:21:25.788 --> 07:21:25.798 align:start position:0%
is being elected yeah yes it would and I
 
07:21:28.430 --> 07:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
think that's my point as well is that
 
07:21:30.048 --> 07:21:30.058 align:start position:0%
this is a dirty laundry issue that the
 
07:21:31.850 --> 07:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
community should work out on their own
 
07:21:35.750 --> 07:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
but uh I guess I'm I'm well at this
 
07:21:37.910 --> 07:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
point I'm willing I'm willing to go
 
07:21:40.250 --> 07:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
along with a retained motion to give
 
07:21:42.230 --> 07:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
them an opportunity to do that and
 
07:21:44.208 --> 07:21:44.218 align:start position:0%
hopefully coach them along those lines
 
07:21:46.610 --> 07:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
Representatives Davis
 
07:21:52.250 --> 07:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
isn't voting itl doing exactly that
 
07:21:54.110 --> 07:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
telling them you have to work this out
 
07:21:57.468 --> 07:21:57.478 align:start position:0%
on your own yeah that is a that is I
 
07:21:59.330 --> 07:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
guess a similar message that would be a
 
07:22:01.850 --> 07:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
similar message yes then why are we
 
07:22:06.110 --> 07:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:08.330 --> 07:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that question was out of line
 
07:22:11.270 --> 07:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
I apologize Mr chair I I guess I'm just
 
07:22:13.490 --> 07:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
I'm frustrated I'm frustrated with the
 
07:22:16.548 --> 07:22:16.558 align:start position:0%
process and I'm frustrated with
 
07:22:18.650 --> 07:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
some contradictions that seem to be
 
07:22:20.030 --> 07:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
cropping up
 
07:22:23.330 --> 07:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
okay I apologize for my for my tone
 
07:22:26.090 --> 07:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
07:22:28.910 --> 07:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
Is there further comment uh before we go
 
07:22:32.030 --> 07:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:35.890 --> 07:22:35.900 align:start position:0%
seeing that I asked the clerk
 
07:22:39.288 --> 07:22:39.298 align:start position:0%
representative comment
 
07:22:42.468 --> 07:22:42.478 align:start position:0%
forgot to lower my hand all right
 
07:22:42.478 --> 07:22:46.930 align:start position:0%
forgot to lower my hand all right
yes

07:22:46.930 --> 07:22:46.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:46.940 --> 07:22:48.490 align:start position:0%
 
right

07:22:48.490 --> 07:22:48.500 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:22:52.430 --> 07:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
and again it can't come back in the same
 
07:22:55.368 --> 07:22:55.378 align:start position:0%
with the same wording uh I just can't
 
07:22:57.770 --> 07:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
repeat that they have to change the
 
07:23:00.048 --> 07:23:00.058 align:start position:0%
legislation to bring it back
 
07:23:03.590 --> 07:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
to retain it it stays the same unless
 
07:23:07.430 --> 07:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's it's uh altered the
 
07:23:10.548 --> 07:23:10.558 align:start position:0%
amendment uh either by the committee or
 
07:23:12.948 --> 07:23:12.958 align:start position:0%
by a combination of the committee and
 
07:23:16.190 --> 07:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:18.670 --> 07:23:18.680 align:start position:0%
so is there are there any more comments
 
07:23:21.590 --> 07:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to ask the clerk
 
07:23:23.628 --> 07:23:23.638 align:start position:0%
to call the roll
 
07:23:23.638 --> 07:23:26.510 align:start position:0%
to call the roll
um yes

07:23:26.510 --> 07:23:26.520 align:start position:0%

approaches

07:23:38.510 --> 07:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:40.548 --> 07:23:40.558 align:start position:0%

yes

07:24:14.990 --> 07:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:15.000 --> 07:24:17.570 align:start position:0%
 
representative

representative
yes

07:24:25.730 --> 07:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:25.740 --> 07:24:29.690 align:start position:0%
 
no

07:24:29.690 --> 07:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:34.250 --> 07:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:38.030 --> 07:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:38.040 --> 07:24:43.010 align:start position:0%
 
no

07:24:43.010 --> 07:24:43.020 align:start position:0%

07:24:46.260 --> 07:24:54.830 align:start position:0%
oh yes
yes

07:24:54.830 --> 07:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:58.250 --> 07:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
the boat is 12 to 5. in favor of the
 
07:25:01.968 --> 07:25:01.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:01.978 --> 07:25:11.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:25:11.390 --> 07:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:14.090 --> 07:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
so is there
 
07:25:16.570 --> 07:25:16.580 align:start position:0%
I think that's the last piece of
 
07:25:18.770 --> 07:25:18.780 align:start position:0%
legislation that uh
 
07:25:20.868 --> 07:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take up today
 
07:25:23.270 --> 07:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
as a reminder remember please remember
 
07:25:25.930 --> 07:25:25.940 align:start position:0%
we're going to start at 8 30. on Monday
 
07:25:29.090 --> 07:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
and plan on a long day Monday because
 
07:25:31.128 --> 07:25:31.138 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to finish up our
 
07:25:33.110 --> 07:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
business on Monday for the for this
 
07:25:34.510 --> 07:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
first half of the
 
07:25:36.708 --> 07:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
legislative session
 
07:25:38.208 --> 07:25:38.218 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
07:25:40.310 --> 07:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have any any pending
 
07:25:42.110 --> 07:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
business does anybody have any
 
07:25:42.120 --> 07:25:43.670 align:start position:0%
business does anybody have any
any

07:25:43.670 --> 07:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
any
 
07:25:47.090 --> 07:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
last-minute comments that they want to
 
07:25:49.850 --> 07:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
make Mr chair are we hearing
 
07:25:53.030 --> 07:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
six bills on Monday and then executing
 
07:25:56.150 --> 07:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
everything that's left yes and then
 
07:25:57.770 --> 07:25:57.780 align:start position:0%
we're executing the bills we're hearing
 
07:26:00.650 --> 07:26:00.660 align:start position:0%
Monday on Monday yes
 
07:26:03.530 --> 07:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you my understanding is we need to
 
07:26:03.540 --> 07:26:05.330 align:start position:0%
thank you my understanding is we need to
have

07:26:05.330 --> 07:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
have
 
07:26:07.788 --> 07:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
if we were gonna what would be more
 
07:26:10.430 --> 07:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
ideal than what I tried to do is try to
 
07:26:12.650 --> 07:26:12.660 align:start position:0%
do the exact thing on Wednesday
 
07:26:15.948 --> 07:26:15.958 align:start position:0%
but I was told that that's too late that
 
07:26:18.350 --> 07:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
all our business has to be done by close
 
07:26:20.150 --> 07:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
of business on Tuesday or first thing
 
07:26:21.948 --> 07:26:21.958 align:start position:0%
Wednesday morning and it doesn't give us
 
07:26:24.530 --> 07:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to get that last piece of
 
07:26:27.170 --> 07:26:27.180 align:start position:0%
executive gun so unfortunately we're
 
07:26:28.368 --> 07:26:28.378 align:start position:0%
going to uh
 
07:26:29.868 --> 07:26:29.878 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a full day money yes
 
07:26:32.448 --> 07:26:32.458 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes a follow-up thank you we
 
07:26:35.868 --> 07:26:35.878 align:start position:0%
had a similar Bill to HB 266 last year
 
07:26:39.048 --> 07:26:39.058 align:start position:0%
and the hearing was quite lengthy are we
 
07:26:40.430 --> 07:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
anticipating that we're going to have
 
07:26:42.890 --> 07:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
that many people uh testifying on this
 
07:26:45.850 --> 07:26:45.860 align:start position:0%
bill this time
 
07:26:50.628 --> 07:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
266 that's the uh Sanctuary bills
 
07:26:52.310 --> 07:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I would imagine that's going to be
 
07:26:55.368 --> 07:26:55.378 align:start position:0%
a lively debate I I would be uh I would
 
07:26:56.750 --> 07:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
not be truthful but I didn't think and
 
07:26:58.190 --> 07:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why I put it
 
07:26:58.200 --> 07:26:59.750 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why I put it
last

07:26:59.750 --> 07:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
last
 
07:27:01.910 --> 07:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
if it's a lively debate and starting at
 
07:27:04.368 --> 07:27:04.378 align:start position:0%
11 o'clock that means likely if it was
 
07:27:06.948 --> 07:27:06.958 align:start position:0%
like last time it will be at least one
 
07:27:08.810 --> 07:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
or two in the afternoon before we stop
 
07:27:12.230 --> 07:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
hearing um hearing testimony yeah it's
 
07:27:14.208 --> 07:27:14.218 align:start position:0%
very important thing about the length of
 
07:27:15.708 --> 07:27:15.718 align:start position:0%
the day to be honest with you because
 
07:27:19.070 --> 07:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
this day today was brutal for me I'm in
 
07:27:20.868 --> 07:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of pain from sitting this long so
 
07:27:22.968 --> 07:27:22.978 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to figure out how to
 
07:27:22.978 --> 07:27:25.070 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to figure out how to
handle

07:27:25.070 --> 07:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
handle
 
07:27:28.190 --> 07:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
another day like this next week if you
 
07:27:28.200 --> 07:27:28.730 align:start position:0%
another day like this next week if you
um

07:27:28.730 --> 07:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:27:30.650 --> 07:27:30.660 align:start position:0%
if you would like I certainly wouldn't
 
07:27:33.048 --> 07:27:33.058 align:start position:0%
object if you wanted to bring your lunch
 
07:27:35.570 --> 07:27:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh and uh
 
07:27:37.670 --> 07:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
and have and we could work through a
 
07:27:39.590 --> 07:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
lunch if you're comfortable doing that
 
07:27:42.530 --> 07:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
uh and that as long as we can ask
 
07:27:43.730 --> 07:27:43.740 align:start position:0%
everybody to chew with their mouths
 
07:27:49.448 --> 07:27:49.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:53.570 --> 07:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative you have a I
 
07:27:56.030 --> 07:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted the process is going to be
 
07:27:59.990 --> 07:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
be here uh public hearing and then turn
 
07:28:02.208 --> 07:28:02.218 align:start position:0%
around and do the exact what would be
 
07:28:03.890 --> 07:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
the process so I know I can prepare
 
07:28:08.090 --> 07:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
myself better what to anticipate
 
07:28:10.430 --> 07:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh well we're going to expect that we
 
07:28:11.930 --> 07:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
have a couple of leftover bills from
 
07:28:13.810 --> 07:28:13.820 align:start position:0%
today we have
 
07:28:17.990 --> 07:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
573 574 588
 
07:28:21.010 --> 07:28:21.020 align:start position:0%
left over from today
 
07:28:24.708 --> 07:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
not that was not my question uh just
 
07:28:26.690 --> 07:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
saying that we're gonna we'll exec those
 
07:28:28.850 --> 07:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
and we'll we'll have the hearings from
 
07:28:30.410 --> 07:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
for the other bills that have been
 
07:28:32.448 --> 07:28:32.458 align:start position:0%
noticed for hearing and then we'll
 
07:28:35.330 --> 07:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
accept them as well no I was are we
 
07:28:37.190 --> 07:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
going to have public hearing first and
 
07:28:39.410 --> 07:28:39.420 align:start position:0%
then exact session or are we going to
 
07:28:42.110 --> 07:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
intersperse exact public hearing exact
 
07:28:44.448 --> 07:28:44.458 align:start position:0%
public hearing like that that's our
 
07:28:45.890 --> 07:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
intention to have public hearings first
 
07:28:48.770 --> 07:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
and then execs afterwards unless I can
 
07:28:51.350 --> 07:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
sense that that we have a bill that we
 
07:28:52.968 --> 07:28:52.978 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing and I can sense
 
07:28:56.570 --> 07:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
that this there is a A 19-0 or something
 
07:28:59.030 --> 07:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
like that among us and then we just exec
 
07:29:00.948 --> 07:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
it immediately but that I don't
 
07:29:03.708 --> 07:29:03.718 align:start position:0%
anticipate that but if I if I sense that
 
07:29:05.990 --> 07:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'll try to do that to make us make
 
07:29:08.690 --> 07:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
things move along a little faster but uh
 
07:29:12.288 --> 07:29:12.298 align:start position:0%
my my plan is to have pairings first
 
07:29:14.150 --> 07:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
starting at 8 30.
 
07:29:17.690 --> 07:29:17.700 align:start position:0%
and uh in fact there was one hearing we
 
07:29:19.730 --> 07:29:19.740 align:start position:0%
were going to uh planning on doing right
 
07:29:19.740 --> 07:29:21.468 align:start position:0%
were going to uh planning on doing right
away

07:29:21.468 --> 07:29:21.478 align:start position:0%
away
 
07:29:25.670 --> 07:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:27.530 --> 07:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
I can't remember right now but we'll
 
07:29:30.350 --> 07:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
have I'm sorry representative Porter you
 
07:29:32.810 --> 07:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
no no what we just killed 512 I thought
 
07:29:35.448 --> 07:29:35.458 align:start position:0%
it was Bill 512 but it's not
 
07:29:37.850 --> 07:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
right so but but representative major
 
07:29:40.128 --> 07:29:40.138 align:start position:0%
putty my plan is to do public hearings
 
07:29:43.910 --> 07:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
first and then exec afterwards
 
07:29:43.920 --> 07:29:47.270 align:start position:0%
first and then exec afterwards
okay

07:29:47.270 --> 07:29:47.280 align:start position:0%

07:29:56.868 --> 07:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
