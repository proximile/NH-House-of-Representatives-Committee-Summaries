through this
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
um just as a preface that I feel
 
00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:36.519 align:start position:0%
obligated to say at this time I am the
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
luckiest person in the world and I know
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
I'm quoting somebody else and saying
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
that and no I do not have a bad
 
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
neurological disease right now um but I
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
really am um for most of my life I've
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
been able to advocate for the rights of
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
those who are stigmatized by those
 
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
around them too off and those who had
 
00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
promised to help them um for the past 40
 
00:09:59.069 --> 00:09:59.079 align:start position:0%
years I've been able to do that for a
 
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
living and that is such a
 
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
blessing as rewarding as that can be at
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
times it's really challenging in such
 
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
times um I draw strength from this book
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
um I read this first when I was 12 years
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
old um it's the Gail sers autobiography
 
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:17.720 align:start position:0%
was a famous professional football had
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
it not been for knee injuries we would
 
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
probably be talking about him as the
 
00:10:25.069 --> 00:10:25.079 align:start position:0%
greatest player in NFL history um
 
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that did happen and he saw
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
that as a blessing which was very
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
strange but the book was about his life
 
00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
and his relationship with a gentleman
 
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
named Brian Piccolo who later died of
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
cancer Gail's black Brian's white back
 
00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:40.839 align:start position:0%
that in the 60s that was a really
 
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
interesting thing to talk about a
 
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
relationship like that um Brian Piccolo
 
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
later died they made a movie called
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
Brian's Song and that was based on this
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
book but that's not what I wanted to say
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
the title is I am third and what that
 
00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
means is the Lord is first my friends
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
and family are second and I am third
 
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
and it's a very interesting take on the
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
Golden Rule but it's something that I've
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
dealt with it's been my motto my entire
 
00:11:09.629 --> 00:11:09.639 align:start position:0%
life and I thank him tremendously for
 
00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:12.200 align:start position:0%
that um while life can be challenging
 
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
it's infinite it is infinitely less so
 
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
because of the support that I receive
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
from so many people around me and
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that I could have done
 
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
in my life whether it's a church my work
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
my advocacy my authorship that I could
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
do without that and I'm really thankful
 
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
and with that um like to talk about
 
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
hb70 um just for your reference oh God
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
why does this happen here it is there is
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the bill which we'll get
 
00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
to but as you know I wrote a book called
 
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
needless suffering um the good thing
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
that comes with writing a book that
 
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
actually has some level of popularity is
 
00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
you get to travel all over the country
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
meet all sorts of really neat people and
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
do all sorts of neat things one of the
 
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
subjects in my book was the whole
 
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
concept of EA ronic medical records and
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
how I think they are a problem so you
 
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
know whenever you're experiencing
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
something a lot of times you think
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
you're alone that nobody else feels the
 
00:12:11.069 --> 00:12:11.079 align:start position:0%
same way so one of the meetings I was
 
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
giving uh a talk before a bunch of
 
00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
family practitioners and I thought I
 
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
should say something so I said if I had
 
00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:19.959 align:start position:0%
my way I would take the alconic medical
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
record I would throw it to the bottom of
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
the ocean I would never bring it back
 
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
and leave it at that and I thought I was
 
00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:28.519 align:start position:0%
get at Rotten Tomatoes thrown at me I
 
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
thought you know whatever quite the
 
00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:32.519 align:start position:0%
opposite happened I got the first
 
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
Standing Ovation in my entire life
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
positive reinforcements so whenever I
 
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
gave that talk and I've spoken all over
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
the country I said the same thing and
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
everywhere I get the same response so if
 
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
that's the case then why do we keep
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
doing it and what's wrong with it and
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
that's what HB 7s designed to fix um as
 
00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:54.519 align:start position:0%
you know some of you know this bill
 
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
passed by consent in this uh body last
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
year um this is something that's
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
bothered me a lot it went to the Senate
 
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
HHS um I was asked to put it to interim
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
study by certain people um I was told by
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
Senator Apprentice that the bill would
 
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
have passed without a question and and
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
had I not agreed to interim study it was
 
00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
my understanding for you neo fites here
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
that the Senate actually did interim
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
studies they do not um um so the bill
 
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
functionally died with my um agreement
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
which really bothers me a lot with that
 
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
said we did talk over the summer and
 
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
that's what the amendment actually
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
addresses um as we proceed um I think
 
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
there's two principles that that guide
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
me that I think that we need to think
 
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:42.519 align:start position:0%
about first um and it's read along in
 
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
your handouts and your himels all right
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go through all this
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
verbatim so it you know um but these two
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
are really important um I've been doing
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
medicine for a long time the first one
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
is the doctor patient relationship is
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
the most important diagnostic
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
therapeutic and human human human human
 
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
tool in health care any public policy
 
00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:05.959 align:start position:0%
Intervention which adversely affects the
 
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:07.720 align:start position:0%
sanctity of this relationship should be
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
viewed skeptically and only supported
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
after an exhaustive review of risks and
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
benefits both intended and unintended
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
second this is really important for a
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
lot of things we're looking at in this
 
00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:21.759 align:start position:0%
legislative session Private Practice
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
unencumbered by unnecessary oversight by
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
the medical industrial complex has been
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
the Bedrock of American Health care the
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
progressive destruction of this entity
 
00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:33.759 align:start position:0%
intended or otherwise will be the
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
lasting and unfortunate Legacy of Health
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
Care reform it is my belief that the ahr
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
fails on both of those counts and that's
 
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
why I brought this bill forward I'm not
 
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
going to read the next part in 1981 I
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
engaged in a debate on pros and cons of
 
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
computers and health care and those
 
00:14:53.949 --> 00:14:53.959 align:start position:0%
seven items that I list there are the
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
things that I said would un happen if we
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
went down this road every one of those
 
00:15:00.189 --> 00:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
seven has has happened which makes me
 
00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:01.749 align:start position:0%
seven has has happened which makes me
function

00:15:01.749 --> 00:15:01.759 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:15:01.759 --> 00:15:03.389 align:start position:0%
function
Nostradamus

00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
Nostradamus
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
um it didn't really need to be this way
 
00:15:09.629 --> 00:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
um in 2004 State of Union President
 
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
George W bush proposed the electronic
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
health record by saying that we can
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
avoid dangerous medical mistakes reduce
 
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
costs and improv care he was implying
 
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
that the EMR would be used to facilitate
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
communication between providers it
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
didn't turn out that way with the
 
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
creation in 2009 of what was called
 
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:31.720 align:start position:0%
meaningful use that we jokingly call
 
00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:35.319 align:start position:0%
meaningless use by by uh CMS and later
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
Chang the name of U managing
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
interoperability which I have no clue
 
00:15:40.269 --> 00:15:40.279 align:start position:0%
what that means but it means something
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
to them um they thought that I don't
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
know what they thought they were doing
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
but what we do know now is that the
 
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
intent was not to facilitate
 
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
communication to not improve patient
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
care but actually to facilitate maximal
 
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
billing and revenue and collect data for
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
public health and other professionals
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's not it's actually not facilitated
 
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
communication which is a
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
problem um I will not get into the
 
00:16:06.509 --> 00:16:06.519 align:start position:0%
adverse effects on providers um Dr
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
Colligan who is speaking later we'll get
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
into that she's way smarter than that
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
about than I am about that but um we'll
 
00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
talk about that later the other thing
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
that bother me is when CMS introduced
 
00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:19.959 align:start position:0%
this they told us that we we could do it
 
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
if we wanted or not but if we chose not
 
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
to do it they would withhold 15% of our
 
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
fees so if Medicare they will withhold
 
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
15% if you don't comp comply and um I
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
personally as as a doctor um am insulted
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
by that and that's basically what killed
 
00:16:38.829 --> 00:16:38.839 align:start position:0%
private practice is because they had to
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
give this incredible technology
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
investment um to to comply with that
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
that's another long story the only other
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
thing I'm going to read is the next
 
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
statement um it comes from Eric toppel
 
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
um he's uh um the founder of scripts
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
Institute which looks at translational
 
00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
stuff he's very smart way smarter than
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
me about technology the good news is
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
both he and I and Dr Woods graduated
 
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
from univis of Rochester med school so
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
he's obviously very smart um but he said
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
the following um I think that the
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
electronic records have been the
 
00:17:15.549 --> 00:17:15.559 align:start position:0%
singular biggest disaster in the last
 
00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
two decades of healthc care the idea was
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
right but the execution has been pitiful
 
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
they are set up for billing purposes
 
00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:24.799 align:start position:0%
which I said they couldn't care less
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
about the patient Centric Vision which I
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
said violation of both principles
 
00:17:30.909 --> 00:17:30.919 align:start position:0%
they're pathetic they're the worst
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
software in existence that I know of
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
they've really taken us astray and have
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
given the whole digital area in
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
healthcare a bad name they've un
 
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
uniformally hated by patients and
 
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
doctors because they involve such poorly
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
performing user interfaces under the
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
single worst part of the deteriorating
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
doctor patient relationship I didn't
 
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
need to say anything else all I had to
 
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
do was read that because he's way
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
smarter than me um needless to say and I
 
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
will leave this to Dr Colligan to
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
discuss pH it's one of the leading
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
causes of physician burnout and we're
 
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with healthc care shortages
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
doctors especially that's a common
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
reason why do doctors go into
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
Specialties and not private primary care
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford to that's why
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have shortages hb70 is
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
a solution to a very real commercial
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
insurer problem all federal insurers
 
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
mandate EMR compliance even though they
 
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
technically don't but they just hold
 
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
back your money if they don't if you
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
don't as of now um I'm pleased to say
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
that local commercial insurers do not
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
require this and they're going to say
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
that this is a solution in term looking
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
for a problem I call it an ounce of
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
prevention we're witnessing an
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
unprecedented oopz of Health Care and
 
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
health insurance in this country and
 
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
there's virtually nothing to stop Mega
 
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
insurers from following the lead of CMS
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
which has always been the rule whatever
 
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Does Medicare does private
 
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
insurance follows mcos representing New
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Grant Advantage Program have
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
more than imp IED this at public
 
00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
hearings where they referred to it as a
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
carrot and a
 
00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
stick um anyways I've said most of that
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
I believe personally that this will
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
create a
 
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
Renaissance of Private Practice and
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
dramatically improve the quality of
 
00:19:18.149 --> 00:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
healthc care decreasing cost increasing
 
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
access and improving efficiency with
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
that said I'm going to hand this out to
 
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
you guys a little old
 
00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:33.640 align:start position:0%
and all it does is say what her problems
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
are what her allergies are what her
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
surgeries have been color coded
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
plasticizes and she handed to me in two
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
seconds I knew everything I needed to
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
know about her takes me hours to figure
 
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
out from an electronic record if I ever
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
do know what's going on with that
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
patient which is really a sad statement
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
and when we're thinking cost benefit
 
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
because that's really important here the
 
00:19:57.549 --> 00:19:57.559 align:start position:0%
people that I'm really watching out for
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
here is it may be that doctors you know
 
00:20:03.549 --> 00:20:03.559 align:start position:0%
alpath doctors are a lost cause that's
 
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
sad but it may be however a lot of what
 
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is bring other people
 
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
into the fold acupunctur
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
chiropractors U massage therapists other
 
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh people that provide a valuable Health
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
Care Service we want them involved you
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
know what I hate about them when you
 
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
look at them they're all smiling they're
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
happy when I look at doctors they're
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
miserable and I go why are you happy
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
smiling is I don't have to deal with
 
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
insurance companies it's Wonder and I
 
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
said well why do you want to deal with
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
insurance companies they all say the
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
same thing gives me access to patients
 
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
that need my services so what I want to
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
do is I want to protect them from going
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
down the same mess that doctors went
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
down for that they don't have to make
 
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
this humongous investment in technology
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
that'll make them prone to being you
 
00:20:52.029 --> 00:20:52.039 align:start position:0%
know going down the same uh corporation
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
that doctors have gone through the last
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
major comment I will make is that the
 
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on this bill really bothers
 
00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:04.039 align:start position:0%
me a lot the electronic record has been
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily and excessively
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
costly this is a reason to lower cost
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
for them to even suggest that it's going
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
to increase cost to anybody in the long
 
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
term really bothers me a lot because
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's just not true um the bill itself
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
has three parts I Define EF EMR the
 
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
second part's a series of things called
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
private um umor provider protection all
 
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment does is it puts in the
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
words um let's see or any other
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
information required for the purpose of
 
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
obtaining prior authorization that's all
 
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
it adds um and the reason why was
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
because of our discussion the insurers
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
were concerned that they wouldn't be
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
able to get the data they needed for
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
that and I thought that was a reasonable
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
thing to add what we did remove last
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
year was the patient protection portion
 
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
we have a job to do our job is to put
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
the needs of others at or above our own
 
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
that's what healthc care is all about or
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
what it should be about when something
 
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
gets in our way it needs to get be
 
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
eliminated and that's what the purpose
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
of this bill it's not to eliminate the
 
00:22:21.149 --> 00:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
Emar but maybe take a step way back and
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
try to make it what it was supposed to
 
00:22:24.269 --> 00:22:24.279 align:start position:0%
be in the first place something that
 
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
actually is cost effective and
 
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:28.039 align:start position:0%
facilitates communication that's what
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
the purpose to this bill was I hope you
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
can support it and thank you I'm ready
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
for any questions representative
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
introducing uh this bill uh what would
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
you think about some Sunset Amendment
 
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
because uh if this bill is addressing
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
issue uh that might be fixed uh in the
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
future uh for example if uh CMS rules
 
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
they start that started in 2009 not so
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
long ago if there will be reversed or if
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
there will be some better it system for
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
EMR introduced that will be producing
 
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
like a single view what happening in
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
this patient so maybe like in a year or
 
00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0%
two or in three years maybe we won't
 
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
need this law anymore so what I have
 
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that you actually brought up
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
a point that I kind of forgot to make
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
number one there is a precedent for this
 
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
bill um I'm not directly answering your
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
question I'm being a politician and
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
answering it a separate way um last year
 
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
I passed the prior authorization bill
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
that I wrote with a bunch of other
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
people like a hundred other people and
 
00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
um that bill actually did create
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
separate formats for filing prior
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
authorization that you could do it
 
00:23:58.029 --> 00:23:58.039 align:start position:0%
either electronically or not so
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
basically this is doing the same thing
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not against the concept of EMR like
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
one of my friends is an acupuncturist
 
00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
and she has a incredibly cheap EMR
 
00:24:10.669 --> 00:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
system that works really well for her if
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
you can do it cheaply and and
 
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
efficiently but not having interfere
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
with what your interaction with the
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
patient is then it's fine I personally
 
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
have a no computer rule there are no
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
computers allowed in a patient room ever
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
and the reason why is cuz I just don't
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
want something to get between me and
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
them and that's why I don't wear a
 
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
weight coat for the same reason I don't
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
want something get between me and them
 
00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
that's never going to change um drct oh
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
God I can never remember how to say his
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
name um sorry Dr
 
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
toppel um he's of the belief that
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence um will solve
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
all of our problems which I think gets
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
to what you just said um um excuse me
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
for being skeptical um I I just I don't
 
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
00:24:59.230 --> 00:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
um every patient in individual and
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence will never ever
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
substitute for our
 
00:25:08.269 --> 00:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
Humanity does that answer your
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
question you also represent
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas and then
 
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.070 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas and then
representative

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:15.149 --> 00:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
lontine thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question this is a would
 
00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:18.919 align:start position:0%
would you believe question would you
 
00:25:21.789 --> 00:25:21.799 align:start position:0%
believe that over a very brief period of
 
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
time I had to learn five different emrs
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
reflecting three different Hospital
 
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
Systems my My Own Private Practice in
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
the clinic where I taught that required
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
attending seminars over weekends taking
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
time away from family that I didn't have
 
00:25:39.149 --> 00:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
to begin with and there's one other
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
thing about the Advent of EMR that
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
greatly troubled me and you touched on
 
00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:45.559 align:start position:0%
it I was horrified when I began to see
 
00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:47.559 align:start position:0%
medical students and residents who spent
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
more time looking at a screen than they
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
did making eye contact when they would
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
ask patients questions about their
 
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
symptoms answer that with a would you
 
00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.470 align:start position:0%
symptoms answer that with a would you
believe

00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:01.720 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I'm I created a
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
program at the University of Rochester
 
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
to focus on the teaching of Dr patient
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
communication with regards to pain
 
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
management but when I asked them I said
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
how do you guys deal with and they said
 
00:26:14.909 --> 00:26:14.919 align:start position:0%
our job is to teach them how to interact
 
00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:17.320 align:start position:0%
with patients and that's what we do the
 
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
computer can come later and I'm very
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
proud that my University still does that
 
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
so thanks for bringing that up that's a
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
horrible problem you mentioned
 
00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
representative lontine
 
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and um thank you
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel for being here and
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
for this Bill I'm wondering though with
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
given the um concentration of Health
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
Care businesses like in my area Mass
 
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
General Brigham has bought up the
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
hospital just about every Private
 
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
Practice how if they have their own
 
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
medical record how how anyone that has
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
to interact with that
 
00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:06.919 align:start position:0%
Network can um not also have to
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
participate in their medical record
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
system I'm looking more broader a lot
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
broader than that I mean if an
 
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
institution chooses to use that for
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
their own thing like for example you
 
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
know I interact regularly with Dartmouth
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
I interact regularly with the VA we
 
00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
don't interact with our systems at all
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
um and they're not I mean the VA system
 
00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
is horrible I don't care what they say
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's horrible I think dartmouth's system
 
00:27:33.789 --> 00:27:33.799 align:start position:0%
is not a whole lot better um when I get
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
records from them it takes me forever to
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
figure out why the patient's even there
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
you know what we used to
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
do we used to actually call each other
 
00:27:45.389 --> 00:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
and we would call the doctor up and say
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
this is what I'm I'm why I'm referring
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
the patient to this is what I need from
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
you we called each other the mo the the
 
00:27:54.669 --> 00:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
most the least frequently used app on my
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
phone is my phone now but back then it
 
00:28:00.269 --> 00:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
was and and and there's some wisdom to
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
that because personto person
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
communication is way better than
 
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
electronic communication especially when
 
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with complex issues like
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
this so um I'm not really persuaded by
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
that argument if they want to do that
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
that's certainly their business again
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
I'm really worried about chiropractors
 
00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists and massage therapists
 
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:20.919 align:start position:0%
and people like that who've not been
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
forced down to go down this road to
 
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
allow them to have you know to be able
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
to focus on what they do best I mean um
 
00:28:31.149 --> 00:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
I'm always jealous of them because they
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
not just cuz they're happy but they do
 
00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
what I wish I could do you know I don't
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
know if that answered your question but
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
I the other little Minor Detail that's
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
relative to what you just said that we
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
need to be really worried about um um I
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
work with the Department of Healthcare
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
economics the University of Rochester
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that I've heard
 
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
before he wasn't the first person to say
 
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
this is that within 10 years we will
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
have an oligopoly
 
00:28:58.559 --> 00:28:59.750 align:start position:0%
have an oligopoly
of

00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
um insurers and health care providers in
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
this country we're already seeing that
 
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
happen in this state
 
00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:10.039 align:start position:0%
CMC and um you know I personally think
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
these are incredibly dangerous
 
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
precedents and um I think that we need
 
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
to do anything that we can do to stop it
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that we really
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
need to do is promote for an advocate
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
for Private Practice because I'll be
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
honest we did much better than that
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
we're doing now that's my
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
opinion anyways representative pmer did
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
do you have your hand up
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair um so I mean what
 
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
I've lived most of what you've just said
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
and I agree
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
with 99% and the only concern I have is
 
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
this so um we just had a a local
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
practitioner who maintained his private
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
practice until he I think he just
 
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:53.919 align:start position:0%
retired and he was either 98 or 99 and
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
he only got a fax machine you know 5
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
years ago but the only the so the main
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
concern I I have and I think you know
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
most people he he did answer the phone
 
00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:07.519 align:start position:0%
um most
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
people he had access to the Dartmouth
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
system so when his patients went to
 
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth and saw the cardiologist he
 
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
could look look that or rather his
 
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
secretary could look it up for him and
 
00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:19.559 align:start position:0%
print it out so he could see what
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
happened and I just want to be reassured
 
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:26.200 align:start position:0%
that nothing in what you're proposing
 
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
here would stop that and and the other
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
thing is that somehow if if my patient
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
goes to a another practitioner that we
 
00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
have a way to get that information to
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
our chart probably a faxed copy that
 
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
gets scanned in but that's that would be
 
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
my only concern just cuz yeah cuz I in
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
the old days you would see a patient in
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
followup and you wouldn't be able to you
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
know they they went to see the
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
neurologist and that report wouldn't be
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
there and it would be a wasted visit now
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
I that almost never happens so back in
 
00:31:01.629 --> 00:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
my day like in our day when we were
 
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
young we always had the records we we
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
didn't need a statute to say you have to
 
00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
send a record I had no trouble if a doc
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
referred me a patient I'd get something
 
00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
in the mail or whatever it happen right
 
00:31:16.509 --> 00:31:16.519 align:start position:0%
away but would you believe that I only
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
agree with my wife 70% of the time so if
 
00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
you agreed with me 99% of the time I'm
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
not sure if our relationship is really
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
ready for that
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
but I I if we agreed on everything that
 
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
would be and and again there's two other
 
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
comments that I wanted to make one was
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
that um I have no problem with an EMR
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
like I love our EMR acopa like it's it
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
looks the same as the record we used to
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
use it's you know it's not in paper form
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
but it's the same format when a doctor
 
00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
writes a note that's where you do your
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
thinking and if you have to stick your
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
notes in a template that's what most of
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
these emrs do then all of a sudden is
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
where does the thinking go you know and
 
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
and and I I asked eopa also um you know
 
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
the 15% thing I asked him how much does
 
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
it cost us to comply with that
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
15% and I couldn't get a good answer but
 
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
I said if it's more than 15% why are we
 
00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:14.919 align:start position:0%
even complying at all you know um but I
 
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
love RMR but apparently now we have to
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
change it and we're going to follow
 
00:32:20.509 --> 00:32:20.519 align:start position:0%
everybody's lead which bothers me a lot
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
life representative Woods oh thank you
 
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for listening to
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh me the old dinosaur as you
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
ref um uh yes for people who gather we
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
we did practice in the same office I
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
retired Liv years ago and I was not
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
faced with that um I did all my activity
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
face to face um having said that and
 
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
referring to the what I interpret as the
 
00:32:55.629 --> 00:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
inevitability of the
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
EMR although we're trying to make some
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
changes es what in your mind is the
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
major impediment to
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
achieving an EMR that's meaningful and
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
I'll when you're done I'll offer my
 
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
thought can I say
 
00:33:16.029 --> 00:33:16.039 align:start position:0%
greed so um you know when we start I
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
mean as President Bush had suggested
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
that was an honorable path to follow and
 
00:33:24.509 --> 00:33:24.519 align:start position:0%
why we deviated from that path I have
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely no idea but um you know the
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
way it got designed was to you this
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
might have been after your time I don't
 
00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
think so but you know was all the you
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
know you had to have so many bullets to
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
build for such and such a level the
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
whole EMR was designed to make sure that
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
you got enough bullets in to be able to
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
Bill a certain amount that's like
 
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
perverse but that is how it was designed
 
00:33:49.149 --> 00:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
and then with meaningful use like every
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
time you go to your doctor and you ask
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
are you wearing a bicycle helmet do you
 
00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
feel safe in your house is your gun
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
locked up all those questions those are
 
00:33:58.509 --> 00:33:58.519 align:start position:0%
public health questions
 
00:34:00.509 --> 00:34:00.519 align:start position:0%
that and I'm still never sure how that
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
public health information gets from my
 
00:34:05.789 --> 00:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
EMR to them with and considering Hippa
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
and all that other stuff but some that's
 
00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
why that data is being collected I was
 
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
at a a meeting of the national pain I I
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
was part of the national pain strategy
 
00:34:16.589 --> 00:34:16.599 align:start position:0%
and there were like 200 docks in a room
 
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
and they're trying to figure out what
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
our problem is lack of data so they were
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
going to use this as a means of getting
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
meaningful use as a means of getting
 
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
more data so then they listed all the
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
questions that they wanted to add to
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
meaningful use and then I raise my hand
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
and I asked is there anybody else here
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
that actually practices clinically not a
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
single person raise their hand but me
 
00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
and I said do you know what doing that's
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
going to do to my time with the patient
 
00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
and it was kind of like Earth shattering
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
statement but it that is what it's
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
designed for just those two things if it
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
could be redesigned like RR is it
 
00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.270 align:start position:0%
could be redesigned like RR is it
conquered

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
conquered
 
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
Ortho that it facilitates com
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
communication and that when you see the
 
00:34:59.310 --> 00:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
doctors know you know exactly why the
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
patients there what their problems are
 
00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:02.599 align:start position:0%
what their allergies are what their
 
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
surgeries are like that plastic thing I
 
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
just handed out that cost nothing my
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
wife did that for me yesterday that cost
 
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
me something do you want this back by
 
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
the way yeah I guess you can have it um
 
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
but um you know that's what I think the
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
EMR should
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
become I there there's you know and I
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
would say that greed is the big barrier
 
00:35:26.109 --> 00:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
that we need to get
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
over follow up uh would you believe uh I
 
00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
uh sort of agree in the sense of greed I
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
call it the corporatization of medicine
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
or the fragmentation of
 
00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
medicine uh and would you believe that a
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
Single Payer would obviate a significant
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
part of this
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
problem and I submit an example and U
 
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
people here are not I'm sure you are
 
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
familiar with uh the Health Care system
 
00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
in Singapore where you carry a card like
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
a driver's license and it's updated
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
every time you have an encounter
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
electronically and you walk in wherever
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
it is and you give them that and it's
 
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
put into the computer and every
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely every item is in place that's
 
00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
an ideal
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
EMR um is that how you Invision that
 
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
transition not discarding the
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
EMR but this your bill is a step to gain
 
00:36:30.599 --> 00:36:31.829 align:start position:0%
EMR but this your bill is a step to gain
that

00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
endpoint I would agree with that up to a
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
point this is my
 
00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
concern um you know the type patients I
 
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
deal with I deal with patients that have
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
really complex disabilities I deal with
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
patients that are stigmatized on a
 
00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
regular basis
 
00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
um they don't their their problems don't
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
lend themselves to an easy diagnosis so
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
doctors will throw all these little
 
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:55.640 align:start position:0%
diagnoses in there but the one I hate is
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
opioid dependency when I have a patient
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's being managed successfully on
 
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
opioids and one doctor only takes one
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
puts opioid dependency on that gets in
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
their problem list and you know how hard
 
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
it is to get that out of that problem
 
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
list and that person is now further
 
00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
stigmatized forever I had one patient no
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
lie all they got was volume for an MRI
 
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
and somehow that got translated in
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
anxiety disorder that was 10 years ago
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
an anxiety disorder is still on their
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
medical record and we can't get it off
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
that was the whole person of the purpose
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
of the third part of this bill which we
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
took off which was the patient
 
00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
protection portion is we needed to find
 
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
a way to do that if you can figure out a
 
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
way to make it adaptable so that when
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
the information on there is wrong when
 
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
it tells you exactly what they're there
 
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:45.640 align:start position:0%
for when we're not serving somebody
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
else's needs other than the patients if
 
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
we can do all those things then that's
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
great but I think we need a dramatic
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
reset to do that and I'm not convinced
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
AI is going to help that um I I
 
00:37:58.990 --> 00:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
convinced other qu representative
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
hartnet I'm sorry to take all your time
 
00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
keep going I'm sorry this is fun for me
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair good to see you
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thanks um
 
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
appreciating uh this bill let's assume
 
00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
that it
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
passes um what do you imagine might be
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
the kind of next generation of
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
legislation that would follow
 
00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
this I I'm not I'm I I believe
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
personally that legislation is too often
 
00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
and unne necessary evil I think that um
 
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
this this is
 
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
a a start a shot across the bow maybe
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
but I really think that what we're doing
 
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
at the state and we've done this with
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
other things the prior authorization
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
Bill we passed a bill a couple years ago
 
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
on opioid dependency and morphine
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
milligram equivalents that set a stage
 
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
for change all over the country and
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
that's kind of like the way I look at
 
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
this it's got to start somewhere and you
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
know yeah the commercial industry is a
 
00:38:59.950 --> 00:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
right this isn't a problem in our state
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
right now um at least as far as they're
 
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
concerned but it could be but at the
 
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
same point with prior oth not only did
 
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
we make a change there but we made a
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
change with CMS too you need to have
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
both of those things happen and and then
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden you know a little Ripple
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
little Pebble becomes a big Ripple and
 
00:39:21.309 --> 00:39:21.319 align:start position:0%
that that to me is what I'm trying to do
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
here the sad part is when you travel all
 
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
over the country and get the same
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
Standing Ovation for saying the same
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
stupid thing everywhere that's a problem
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
that people need we need to do something
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
about so that's what I Envision next
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
steps is we take this
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
Federal um and I actually already met
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
with our legislators in Washington to
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
talk about that um so it's it's it's a
 
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
start I used to have a friend that
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
directed HHS in Washington and we had
 
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
started that discussion but you know
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
like those jobs aren't there forever you
 
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
know so any other
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
questions representa
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr
 
00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.670 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr
chairman

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
U I don't know how to ask this question
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm concerned about the state
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
to uh structure their records but I
 
00:40:23.109 --> 00:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
wonder do they do the same thing
 
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
for the changes that have help happened
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
like there are nurse practitioners there
 
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
are uh chiropractors there are social
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
workers there's all kinds of people uh
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
who see patients who keep records are
 
00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:41.870 align:start position:0%
who see patients who keep records are
they

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:40:46.829 --> 00:40:46.839 align:start position:0%
required uh to follow state law and and
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
if you have any opinion as to why
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
Physicians have been uh pointed out um
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
anybody that participates with CMS in
 
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
any way shape or form has to participate
 
00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
if you participate with the Managed Care
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state through the
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
granite state Advan Medicaid Program you
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
have to participate if you have to
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
practice through Medicaid you have to
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
participate if you're strict fee for
 
00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
service direct care whatever term you
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
want to use to call it you you don't
 
00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:19.240 align:start position:0%
have to so it's just them but anybody
 
00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
like if I'm a chiropractor and I build
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
Medicare I got to part I have to do this
 
00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:26.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I don't have to but they're
 
00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
going to withhold some of my salary
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
that's all followup
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
followup would you consider legislation
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
requirement I'm you know what's funny we
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
apparently don't like
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
mandates so we got a mandate so if we
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
don't like them maybe we should get rid
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
of it I don't know I I I I think that
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
you need you know when you practice
 
00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
medicine you really need to figure out
 
00:41:58.829 --> 00:41:58.839 align:start position:0%
what you need to do to interact best
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
with your patient first you know the
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
other people around you second um and I
 
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
think you need to make that individual
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
decision I don't think it's right for
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
somebody to tell you I personally think
 
00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
if CMS wanted to do it this way it
 
00:42:13.309 --> 00:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
should have been a 15% reduction they'll
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
give you 15% more you know it's positive
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
reinforcement not negative and I I think
 
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
that would have been a better way to
 
00:42:25.549 --> 00:42:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
know yeah I don't I'd have to think
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
about that that's a good
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
question tune in later thank you Mr
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
chairman for allowing my call um so
 
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel are there other
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
states with similar legislation number
 
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
one and number two uh what is the
 
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
position to your knowledge of any of the
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
medical uh uh professional associations
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
on this on this view so um to answer
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
your first question no I really enjoy
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
being a voice crying in the wilderness
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
and that is what this is um secondly
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
last year I haven't I never approached
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
them this year because um but last year
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
the medical society and the hospital
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
Association did support this um the US
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
pain Foundation supports this the
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic organization the state
 
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
supports this the acupuncture
 
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
Association the state supports this I've
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
not talked to the massage people and the
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
psychology people did support it last
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
year I did not do my due diligence to
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
get their approval again this
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
year other questions
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
I think that's it do you want this
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative Nel sure my wife would
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate very creative and a lot of
 
00:43:35.309 --> 00:43:35.319 align:start position:0%
work went into it and I'm not sure what
 
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
you I'm sorry to take so much of your
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
minutes also signed up to speak is
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
Sabrina Dunlap from Anthem Blue Cross
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
Shield good morning Mr chair and um
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
members of the Health and Human Services
 
00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the opportunity
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
to speak my name is Sabrina Dunlap I'm
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
senior director of government relations
 
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
for Anthem we are opposed to sb70 for a
 
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
number of reasons I believe all of which
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
I've discussed with rep Nagel we've had
 
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
some very good discussions about this uh
 
00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
this bill and it's true in general we do
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
think the as a solution in search of a
 
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
problem as rep Nagel noted CMS led the
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
charge on EMR um it was not commercial
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
carriers and so we did not create the
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
current world of electronic records
 
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
we're just living in it um and so you
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
know notably we do not force providers
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
to use EMR many do but to the extent we
 
00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
and providers do use EMR we need to be
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
able to use it properly um and one of
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
the major problems with this bill is it
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
restricts how we use EMR and in in the
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
cases where we're already using it uh
 
00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
and so what I mean is the Restriction of
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
requiring only certain data particularly
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
in section D is at odds with reality um
 
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
there are some situations where we may
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
need more information to process a claim
 
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
for example um and I appreciate the
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
amendment which I just saw I think it
 
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
improves that language I don't think it
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
solves the problem entirely
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
think I think that the bills attempting
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
to do something I I appreciate sort of
 
00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
the Grievances about EMR um I think
 
00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
trying to sort of turn back the clock on
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
EMR but instead what the bill will do is
 
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
limit our ability to do basic functions
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
with providers when they are already
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
engaged via electronic medical record um
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
and that is quite problematic from a
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
logistical perspective um so I think
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
that's it and I'm happy to take any
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
questions and thank you very much for
 
00:45:56.549 --> 00:45:56.559 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak okay thank you
 
00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
any question questions representative
 
00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:02.839 align:start position:0%
Lucas uh do you foresee uh should this
 
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
bill become law any um withdrawal of
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage from a state that has
 
00:46:10.319 --> 00:46:11.510 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage from a state that has
this

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:46:13.549 --> 00:46:13.559 align:start position:0%
law thank you for the question I want to
 
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand you mean like
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
what a carrier leave the state and no
 
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
longer provide yes thank
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
you that is a good question um I don't
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
know I don't I don't think so I think
 
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
in general this would be moving New
 
00:46:31.549 --> 00:46:31.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the wrong direction I mean
 
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
I think the horses out of the barn on
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
this it was over 20 years ago um that
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
CMS started with emrs and so it is the
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
norm um I think when we compare New
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to other states where Anthem
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
does business New Hampshire does have a
 
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
lower adoption of EMR but is still quite
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
High I believe it's like over 80% um but
 
00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
I do think this creates some serious
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
logistical and practical problem s for
 
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
carriers um so I don't know if that
 
00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.549 align:start position:0%
carriers um so I don't know if that
answers

00:47:02.549 --> 00:47:02.559 align:start position:0%
answers
 
00:47:05.309 --> 00:47:05.319 align:start position:0%
question other questions representative
 
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
mark alen thank you for taking my
 
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
question um how do you respond to
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel's uh proposition
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
that this may be the the additional cost
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
this may be a prime reason it's driving
 
00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
people out of Private
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
Practice electronic records are driving
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
people yeah thank you for the question I
 
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
I mean I think I understand uh the
 
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
concerns coming from providers I mean I
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
have providers who seem to like
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
electronic health records um so I guess
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
it depends on the practice but I guess
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
to that issue I would say I don't think
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
this bill does anything to address that
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
if it's a grievance with
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
EMR I just don't see how this gets at
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
the issue because this is a scenario
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
where we're already using it where're
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
providers are already engaged with us
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
via EMR and then it only restricts
 
00:47:56.109 --> 00:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
health insurance companies and how we
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
can engage with the providers so that I
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
think is the problem with the way the
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
bill is written okay thank you thank you
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh uh could you
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
clarify if you remember what
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
specifically in the amendment uh can
 
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
improve this bill because if I see
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
correctly the amendment
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
actually um adds to the list so I'm not
 
00:48:30.599 --> 00:48:32.710 align:start position:0%
actually um adds to the list so I'm not
completely

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
completely
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
sure thank you so um talking
 
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
specifically about section D and the I I
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
think that the amendment helps because
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
it adds any other information required
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
for purposes of obtaining prior oth but
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
we use and providers use EMR for a wide
 
00:48:50.589 --> 00:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
range of of issues including claims
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
processing um and so I just think D is
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
not broad enough um and it just gets at
 
00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
the heart of the problem which is if we
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
are engaged via EMR we have to be able
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
properly other questions representative
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
Woods thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh given that
 
00:49:14.789 --> 00:49:14.799 align:start position:0%
this seems to be a f compete I.E the
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
medical record um and having served on
 
00:49:20.589 --> 00:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
anthem's board in the early years when
 
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
they took over Blue Cross from Shield uh
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
they were not favorable in looking at
 
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
this issue has there been a change
 
00:49:30.789 --> 00:49:30.799 align:start position:0%
noting that this will be something that
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
we appear to be living with do you sense
 
00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:36.150 align:start position:0%
we appear to be living with do you sense
any

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
movement that there would be a honest
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
consideration to work with all the
 
00:49:45.789 --> 00:49:45.799 align:start position:0%
players uh to try and make the medical
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
record more patient friendly not
 
00:49:49.599 --> 00:49:51.069 align:start position:0%
record more patient friendly not
business

00:49:51.069 --> 00:49:51.079 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
friendly thank you for the question I
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
I'm not involved in our electronic
 
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
health record space um but my short
 
00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
answer would be yes we would always be
 
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
happy to come to the table and and work
 
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:07.240 align:start position:0%
in a way that helps our members and
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
helps providers and I actually don't
 
00:50:11.789 --> 00:50:11.799 align:start position:0%
know that's an interesting fact that if
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
I understood you correctly you're saying
 
00:50:14.789 --> 00:50:14.799 align:start position:0%
that the carriers were not in favor of
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
the move yeah um that's interesting so
 
00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
but yes I think we would be happy to
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
work with whomever to try to make the
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
of just to encourage you to do so I was
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh when I served um for the American
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
Medical Association served on Council on
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
science and public health uh and a
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
special subcommittee we looked at this
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
issue in
 
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
2005 uh and because we could not get any
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
cooperation uh that it fell by the
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
wayside uh and that was the power of
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
Corporations but we would really like to
 
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
see this come to the four
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
again thank you for the question and
 
00:50:58.829 --> 00:50:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:22.589 --> 00:51:22.599 align:start position:0%
hollan hello Mr chairman and members of
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Ruth Colligan
 
00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
and I live in conquer and I'm here in
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 70 I'm a physician
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
an expert in patient safety and a
 
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed research scientist in
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
human factors and in human factors what
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
we do is we study how people work in
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
complex safety critical systems like
 
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
healthcare much of my work was on the
 
00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
impact of EMR implementation on
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers and I'm a bit of a
 
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.230 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers and I'm a bit of a
research

00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:55.240 align:start position:0%
geek the the EMR is not all as cracked
 
00:51:58.950 --> 00:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
up to be us of these systems incurs many
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
hidden costs especially with an ESP
 
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
special burden on small
 
00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
practices first emrs actually increase
 
00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
the documentation burden on
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
practitioners our study showed that for
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
every hour of direct patient contact a
 
00:52:20.789 --> 00:52:20.799 align:start position:0%
provider spent two hours on the
 
00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
computer this is outside of what we now
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
call pajama time which we did with a
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
diary study of Physicians who had to
 
00:52:33.309 --> 00:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
work at home after they got their kids
 
00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
to bed on their charting one and a half
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
home this type of burden is a
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
substantial component of practitioner
 
00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
burnout next emrs are expensive to
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
adopt direct costs for a relatively
 
00:52:59.309 --> 00:52:59.319 align:start position:0%
simple straightforward EMR are $150 to
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
$170,000 to
 
00:53:04.349 --> 00:53:04.359 align:start position:0%
purchase just that's just to purchase it
 
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
then there's
 
00:53:09.309 --> 00:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
$85,000 for implementation which means
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
getting it actually in the practice and
 
00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
up and
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
running and $4 to 8,000 per year per
 
00:53:19.789 --> 00:53:19.799 align:start position:0%
provider to
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
maintain these upfront costs push
 
00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
independent practices to close or to
 
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
join up with bigger corporate Healthcare
 
00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:29.799 align:start position:0%
and Hospital
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
Systems we call this vertical
 
00:53:34.829 --> 00:53:34.839 align:start position:0%
consolidation and this is really been
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
shown to drive up consumer costs New
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire patients
 
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
costs adoption of emrs pose a
 
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
disproportionate burden on small

00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
practices these practices are often the
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
lifeblood of primary care and
 
00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:52.670 align:start position:0%

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
integrative
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
care I ask you to support New Hampshire
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
providers and support cour House Bill 70
 
00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
and um take any questions okay thank you
 
00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:05.950 align:start position:0%
and um take any questions okay thank you
any

00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative Woods uh thank
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um not a question but do
 
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
you have some of that data I think
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
that's important uh for the committee to
 
00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
know the overhead cost especially for
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
the independent practitioners corporate
 
00:54:22.589 --> 00:54:22.599 align:start position:0%
practitioners is a non-starter because
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
they don't pay for it but we're talking
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
about the need for primary care they
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
tend to be smaller practice or
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
individual practices and that's where
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
the really the rubber meets the road
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
with this kind of difficulty if you
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
could provide those numbers I think it
 
00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful I certainly can
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
and I I should state that I found these
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
numbers in
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
a in a pro EHR sort of sales rag that
 
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
was the only numbers I could find that
 
00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:52.599 align:start position:0%
were up to date um other numbers were
 
00:54:52.599 --> 00:54:53.470 align:start position:0%
were up to date um other numbers were
back

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:54:58.990 --> 00:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
from 2010 20 um 15 so those were out of
 
00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
date you'll see those numbers often
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
quoted but they're wrong they're out
 
00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:03.630 align:start position:0%
quoted but they're wrong they're out
they're

00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:03.640 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
old yeah other
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thanks
 
00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.309 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thanks
thank

00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%

minutes if you could keep closer to
 
00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
three I'd appreciate it I will do my
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
best uh thank you Mr chairman members of

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
Peter bragon I'm a senior policy adviser
 
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
at predy strategies in conquer uh here
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
today representing Harvard Pilgrim
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
Healthcare New Hampshire's not for
 
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
profit health insurance carrier uh and
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
here opposed to House Bill 70 and uh
 
00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
this is a bill we've seen before and uh
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
I start off by saying I always feel bad
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
uh testifying against one of represented
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
neel's bills because although we will
 
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes disagree on things as health
 
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:07.240 align:start position:0%
carriers and health providers um his
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
perspective on thing from someone on the
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
ground uh and the work that he does is
 
00:56:15.549 --> 00:56:15.559 align:start position:0%
is very um enlightening so um disagree
 
00:56:17.309 --> 00:56:17.319 align:start position:0%
with that and I'll start by saying too
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
that I can understand a lot of things
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
that were said by Dr Nigel and uh Dr I
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
forget the woman's name that just spoke
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
um so my my career uh was in uh I have a
 
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
degree in computer science uh out of
 
00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:32.200 align:start position:0%
college I started a uh Consulting and
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
software company uh one of my first
 
00:56:35.069 --> 00:56:35.079 align:start position:0%
clients was in New Hampshire Medical
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
Society uh actually oddly enough um but
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
then uh developed software that ended up
 
00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
um putting us on the Inc 500 list of
 
00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
fastest growing companies in America um
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
and I always told people that the
 
00:56:47.789 --> 00:56:47.799 align:start position:0%
easiest part of developing any software
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
system is actually developing the system
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
the hardest part and the thing that
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to spend two-thirds or more
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
of your time on is making it so someone
 
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
else can use it and from all I've heard
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
uh the testimony these EMR systems that
 
00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:03.039 align:start position:0%
are out there uh didn't take into
 
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
account the the perspective of the
 
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
person that actually has to use it I.E
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
the client uh so I can understand a lot
 
00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
of the problems there and I will say and
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
later on I'll I'll say there are
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
benefits to the use of electronic
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
medical records uh but our position is
 
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this um for a number of
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
reasons one uh we don't think it will
 
00:57:22.109 --> 00:57:22.119 align:start position:0%
accomplish what the sponsor wants if you
 
00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
basically says that only state regulated
 
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
Health carriers uh are subject to this
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
law uh only about 30% of the New
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire health insurance Market is
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
State regulated carriers you have
 
00:57:39.069 --> 00:57:39.079 align:start position:0%
Medicaid you have Medicare you have the
 
00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
VA you have Tricare you have large
 
00:57:43.069 --> 00:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
self-insured company all sell all
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
subject to Federal Regulation not State
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
regulation so the 800 pound gorilla in
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
the health insurance Market is the
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
federal government and they are the ones
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
that are requiring providers to use
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
electronic medical records or
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
at this point maybe they're not
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
requiring but as the Dr Nagel says if
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
you don't use them they take 15% away
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
from you so they are essentially forcing
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
people coercing people to use electronic
 
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
medical records um Dr Nel said he
 
00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
repeated my line from last year uh what
 
00:58:13.789 --> 00:58:13.799 align:start position:0%
was it's a solution in search of a
 
00:58:16.109 --> 00:58:16.119 align:start position:0%
problem line 10 uh says we can't require
 
00:58:18.109 --> 00:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
a healthcare provider to use electronic
 
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
medical records we do not require
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers to use Med
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
electronic medical records nor do we
 
00:58:26.109 --> 00:58:26.119 align:start position:0%
have plans to require them to do so nor
 
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
nor do we know of any other insurance
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
State regulated insurance carriers in
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that require providers to
 
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
do that or intend to provide uh
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
providers to do that um line 11 says is
 
00:58:40.829 --> 00:58:40.839 align:start position:0%
that is that for me
 
00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
yeah you want to start wrap start
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
wrapping up you got something yeah I
 
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:51.640 align:start position:0%
understand I I so uh so um line 10
 
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
something we don't do anyways uh line 11
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
something we don't do anyways it would
 
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
be unw workable line 12 talks about not
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
requiring a specific format there are
 
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
formats required under levels higher
 
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
than us to allow these things to to to
 
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
communicate I have a good friend whose
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
mother is suffering from cancer and
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
hearing the stories about how the
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and the oncologist and the
 
00:59:14.109 --> 00:59:14.119 align:start position:0%
radiologist and the and the primary care
 
00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
provider can all work together and see
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
all the data in front of them is a very
 
00:59:20.109 --> 00:59:20.119 align:start position:0%
important benefit to this so we
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
certainly encourage people to use it we
 
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
like it when people use it but we also
 
00:59:24.029 --> 00:59:24.039 align:start position:0%
understand New Hampshire is a rural
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
State there were a lot of small
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
providers there are a lot of specialty
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
providers you know people doing
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
acupuncture and chiropracty they're not
 
00:59:32.349 --> 00:59:32.359 align:start position:0%
going to be prescribing drugs it's not
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
going to be things that require the use
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
of electronic medical records so this
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
bill uh it it's not something that's
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
happening now it's not needed if you
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
implement it especially lines 12 and 13
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
saying that you can't have requirements
 
00:59:47.069 --> 00:59:47.079 align:start position:0%
for how it works that who to say someone
 
00:59:49.069 --> 00:59:49.079 align:start position:0%
hires someone to build a an electronic
 
00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:51.640 align:start position:0%
medical record for them uh that doesn't
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
communicate with anybody else that
 
00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
defeats the whole purpose of the EMR so
 
00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
the bill has it stands is unworkable and
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
really unnecessary because we're not the
 
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
ones doing this it's CMS that's doing it
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
and that's where the fight should be
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
taken thank you happy to take any
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.349 --> 01:00:16.359 align:start position:0%
you no one else has signed up to speak
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
on on um hb70 FN does anyone else wish
 
01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:21.789 align:start position:0%
on on um hb70 FN does anyone else wish
to

01:00:21.789 --> 01:00:21.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
speak seeing none I'm going to close the
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
public hearing on this bill uh 7 hb70 FN
 
01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:31.079 align:start position:0%

01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
spor on the bill and this bill is just
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
one small step we were hoping to take um
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
to help a particular type of housing for
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities and it's to
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
clarify exemption from
 
01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
lure um and we felt the the bill was
 
01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
needed to correct a misunderstanding in
 
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
the way that bit of Statute was
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
interpreted and as the bill bill now
 
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
reads without the bill it's simp that
 
01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
one section A facilities which are
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
operated for the continuing care of one
 
01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
person or three or fewer persons in a
 
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
facility certified by the Commissioner
 
01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human
 
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
Services and I'm going to talk about a
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
little bit about one situation I I know
 
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
well to help you help you understand the
 
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
certification for PE for a place with
 
01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
just three people or
 
01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
fewer um and that's I think it'll just
 
01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
help understand because I found myself
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
explaining this to other people U
 
01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
because my stepdaughter lives in such a
 
01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
facility um which is a house and she
 
01:10:39.149 --> 01:10:39.159 align:start position:0%
lives with her boyfriend both of them
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
have Down
 
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
syndrome and they live with two home
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
care providers so there's no more than
 
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
two clients Under One Roof the healthc
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
care providers are paid through
 
01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
Community Partners and they provide
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
oversight for the home care providers
 
01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.470 align:start position:0%
oversight for the home care providers
and

01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
support and Eliza and Shane also reive
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
services from other um outside agencies
 
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
and they have each have their own uh
 
01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
independent case manager so in this case
 
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
the whole house does not need to be
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
licensed it's just certified by Health
 
01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
and Human Services for basic things to
 
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
make sure it's a safe place for them to
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
live um but this there are drawbacks to
 
01:11:25.709 --> 01:11:25.719 align:start position:0%
this Home Care providership model and
 
01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
that there tends not to be a permanent
 
01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.110 align:start position:0%
that there tends not to be a permanent
housing

01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
solution now Eliza is lucky that um my
 
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
husband and I were able to buy a house
 
01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
and Rehab it for this purpose but most
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities don't have a
 
01:11:41.629 --> 01:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
father who's a contractor who could pull
 
01:11:41.639 --> 01:11:42.390 align:start position:0%
father who's a contractor who could pull
that

01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
off so because of the lack of permanent
 
01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
Housing Solutions for people with
 
01:11:53.229 --> 01:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
disabilities uh there are a lot of uh
 
01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:55.719 align:start position:0%
parent Le groups across the street state
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
that are trying to set up new
 
01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
Solutions because many of the parents
 
01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
are getting older and they now have
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
adult children still living with them
 
01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
with their with
 
01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities and they're thinking what's
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
going to happen the in the future for my
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
child we need to come up with some other
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
Solutions and there are two concepts
 
01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
that are being pursued by several groups
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
across the state and one the res stents
 
01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
will live in separate
 
01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
apartments under the same roof or maybe
 
01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
separate buildings but they share a
 
01:12:37.629 --> 01:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
common space and the entity which is
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
typically a nonprofit formed by these
 
01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
parents um The Entity would manage the
 
01:12:49.629 --> 01:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
facility and also hire
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
staff who some of them might be
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
providing Transportation or helping to
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
prepare food but that usually would have
 
01:12:59.550 --> 01:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
247 um the other model whatever
 
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
percentage of Apartments set aside for
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities and say a new
 
01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
um large apartment building that's being
 
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
built through the affordable housing
 
01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
Fund in which there could be Workforce
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
housing a lot of people could live there
 
01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:20.870 align:start position:0%
housing a lot of people could live there
but

01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
25% of the units would be set aside for
 
01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
a person with disability I
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
ities and there may be um two or up to
 
01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
three people sharing the apartment
 
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
within this larger building but the
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
difference there is that the nonprofit
 
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
May own the building but they're not
 
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
providing all these comprehensive
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
Services directly there'll be an outside
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
agency that is providing
 
01:13:48.719 --> 01:13:50.750 align:start position:0%
agency that is providing
them

01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
and um they may provide May ride meals
 
01:13:57.790 --> 01:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
or not and may engage in other community
 
01:13:59.470 --> 01:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
activities but their residents would
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
still live independently so those are
 
01:14:03.149 --> 01:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
the two
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
models that we were hoping with this
 
01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
bill to try to clarify the statute so
 
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
that ideally they might be exempt from
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
lure and only be
 
01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.070 align:start position:0%
lure and only be
certified

01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
certified
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
however we amended the bill which I
 
01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
brought forward to
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
you um at the request of dorine chakle
 
01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
at um Health and Human Services who felt
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
that the original bill was not
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
accomplishing what we wanted it to
 
01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:37.960 align:start position:0%
do um and it was also probably not um
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
legal as well so this is very
 
01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
disappointing for um some of the people
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
that we've been working with and trying
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
to come up another another solution
 
01:14:52.629 --> 01:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
because it looks like it would only help
 
01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
the model of the apartment building
 
01:14:58.629 --> 01:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
in which no Direct Services are being
 
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
provided by that
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
nonprofit that got the thing built now
 
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
other people that are here might be able
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
to explain some of this a little better
 
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
but I'm trying to sort of break it down
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
to see what our goals were and what the
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
bill can or cannot do um and it may
 
01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
be that we bring another amendment
 
01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
forward again before we exec the bill
 
01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
because um some people felt like we
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
could have tweaked it a little more we
 
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
might actually making more making things
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
harder than not better
 
01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:36.310 align:start position:0%
harder than not better
um

01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
and what
 
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
else and I would say like there's
 
01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
nothing the first model that this bill
 
01:15:46.629 --> 01:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
or the amended
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
Bill uh we you know we'd like to help
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's a great model and it might be
 
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
though it still might have to be
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
licensed even if we would like to say oh
 
01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
it could just be certified but given the
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
comprehensive nature of the services
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
provided um and that is all done by one
 
01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
entity in which the resident doesn't
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
really have a choice about who's
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
providing these Services they may have
 
01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
to be licensed maybe we can't fix that
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
problem we're still trying to work on it
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
um but we hope that you will support the
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
bill and we can try to come up with the
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
best amendment to fix this problem by
 
01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
the time we have to execute um and then
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
we could move forward in a more you know
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
streamlined fashion the other the other
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
solution is that we try to work on Ru
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
making so
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
that if there's no way around having to
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
be licensed we can try to make
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
lure um as least costly and easy to do
 
01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:50.750 align:start position:0%
lure um as least costly and easy to do
as

01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
possible so um and the other thing is we
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
hope that you will support the bill and
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
help these groups to overcome the
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
biggest obstacle they have which is
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
financing but that's a matter for
 
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
another bill before other committees but
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
just to keep that in
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
 
01:17:18.189 --> 01:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill forward to us I just
 
01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
have a quick question um where it says
 
01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
such units shall meet certification
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
standards established by can you just
 
01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
give like one or two examples of what
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
would be involved in certifying these
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
units the only one I can speak well was
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
why I brought up the home care
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
providership with um where my
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
stepdaughter lives well they check to
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
make sure the smoke detectors are
 
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
current and are inspected annually they
 
01:17:44.629 --> 01:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
make sure that the residents have
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
regular fire drills they make sure the
 
01:17:50.629 --> 01:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
place is is a safe and
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
secure home that's most of what
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
certification is in that
 
01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.990 align:start position:0%
certification is in that
situation

01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.990 align:start position:0%
situation
um

01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
kofo thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I'm trying to
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
understand the the distinctions between
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment and the original bill as
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
filed and I'm looking at the amendment
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
at the moment um the Bold italic say
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
this exemp also applies to buildings
 
01:18:27.709 --> 01:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
that provide residences to both
 
01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
independent individuals and individuals
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
receiving services pursuant to RSA 126
 
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
a19 and
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
20 it then says that it also applies to
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
any entity that provides housing to
 
01:18:43.149 --> 01:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
three or more three or more individuals
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
receiving services pursuant to those um
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
sections provided that the entity does
 
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
not provide or arrange for personal
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
assistance so what I'm struggling with I
 
01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
mean generally I like I I really like
 
01:18:59.709 --> 01:18:59.719 align:start position:0%
the idea of um sort of dialing back and
 
01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
clarifying some of the regulations yeah
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
I'm just struggling to understand sort
 
01:19:08.669 --> 01:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
of the there sort of a confusing mix of
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
what would be exempt and what would not
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
be exempt and so uh both for my own
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
edification and so that we have it
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
clarified on record uh show the courts
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
ever need to uh look at this it would be
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
helpful to me to understand almost like
 
01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
a a matrix or a list of bullet points of
 
01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
which scenarios are Exempted under this
 
01:19:32.430 --> 01:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
amendment and which are not I'm more
 
01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about the amendment that I am
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
with yeah the original bill because I
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
sort of assume that you're bringing
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
forward the amendment with the intention
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
of addressing the concerns that you
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
raised so um do you have that kind of an
 
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
analysis or could you provide that kind
 
01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
of an an analysis to us um at some point
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
F the hearing um and you're not alone in
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
feeling that way and and um actually and
 
01:19:59.550 --> 01:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
Dorene shley is here who really helped
 
01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
draft the amendment because when she
 
01:20:03.229 --> 01:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
looked at the original language that
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
this isn't really going to work it's not
 
01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
going to do what you want but the best I
 
01:20:09.149 --> 01:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
understand it now is saying that you
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
know provide residents to both
 
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
independent individuals and individuals
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
receiving services pursuant to and that
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
is the other whole section about types
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
of services provided to people with
 
01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities so in that scenario it's
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
the apartment building where there are
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
people that aren't getting any services
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
but say we have 25% set aside for people
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
who are um but I I think it's um and I
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
did want to
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
clarify with many of the stakeholders
 
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
that well it can mean that you're still
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
providing um some Community meals and
 
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
and movie night game night a lot of
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
activities but any specific um like
 
01:20:56.590 --> 01:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
medicals services or a personal
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
assistant that helps someone that has
 
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
mobility issues or
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
Transportation they would be have have
 
01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
to be provided by another agency not the
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
entity that owns the
 
01:21:11.229 --> 01:21:11.239 align:start position:0%
building is the difference but we can
 
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
try to break it
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
down and
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
um dorine chuley is also here if you
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
I'll set any question any other
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I'm I'm very interested in
 
01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:38.950 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I'm I'm very interested in
this

01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:21:40.990 --> 01:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
subject uh
 
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
however there are all kinds of housing
 
01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
problems there's mentally ill there are
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
people coming out of prison there are
 
01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
people with developmental disabilities
 
01:21:58.990 --> 01:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
there's all all kinds of of extremely uh
 
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.189 align:start position:0%
there's all all kinds of of extremely uh
needy

01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
needy
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
populations I'm trying to figure out how
 
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
to not get these different groups
 
01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
competing with each other for
 
01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
services and have a united
 
01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
front uh I I'm a landlord who does I
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
have four apartments in my house
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
and uh I I don't want to say too much
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
because it would deal with people's
 
01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:32.750 align:start position:0%
because it would deal with people's
identif

01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
identif
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
identity uh but there are very
 
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
complicated problems for
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
landlords uh who do try to
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
help uh so that
 
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh what I'm saying to you just
 
01:22:51.669 --> 01:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
complicates the problem that you're
 
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
bringing to us uh but but I think it
 
01:22:59.470 --> 01:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be considered because of this
 
01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
is a major State policy
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
issue and one that I'm hoping we can go
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
at that deals with all of the issues and
 
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
do you have any
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
vague concern that I have
 
01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
uh so it sounds like you're saying well
 
01:23:31.629 --> 01:23:31.639 align:start position:0%
I provide housing for people that might
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
qualify for um special services provided
 
01:23:37.709 --> 01:23:37.719 align:start position:0%
by someone
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
else um and are you wondering how much
 
01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
um to what extent will your property
 
01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:48.199 align:start position:0%
need to be certified for certain
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
things I think it should be I'm a a
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
licensed clinical social worker and and
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
I deal all the time unfortunately I've
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
ended up in court uh because of it uh
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
but most landlords are not in that
 
01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
position that I'm in U well I I think
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
the key thing to understand is why in
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
some circumstances it should be okay
 
01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
just to have certification is that many
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
of the other people that are helping to
 
01:24:27.149 --> 01:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
take uh provide services for these
 
01:24:29.470 --> 01:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
residents are licensed in their own
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
field they're licensed to to practice
 
01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:36.280 align:start position:0%
what they do and so it's trying to avoid
 
01:24:42.030 --> 01:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
needed so
 
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
it's the chairman won't let me go on but
 
01:24:52.149 --> 01:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
that uh if if he would we could spend
 
01:24:54.109 --> 01:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
the whole afternoon I definitely don't
 
01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:54.690 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
01:24:54.690 --> 01:24:57.189 align:start position:0%
want to do
[Laughter]

01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:25:00.030 --> 01:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr chairman you're
 
01:25:03.109 --> 01:25:03.119 align:start position:0%
welcome any other
 
01:25:11.709 --> 01:25:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:14.119 align:start position:0%
thanks also signed up to speak is
 
01:25:16.590 --> 01:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
representative Kathy

stab is it stab or sto
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is um
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
Kathy stabb and I'm a representative for
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District 25 which is Ward five
 
01:25:43.709 --> 01:25:43.719 align:start position:0%
in Manchester last year I had the
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
privilege to serve with the sponsor of
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
this bill on the study committee on the
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
impact of the housing crisis on people
 
01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:50.550 align:start position:0%
impact of the housing crisis on people
with

01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
disabilities we learned that there was
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
an overarching issue around the fact
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
that most people with disabilities have
 
01:25:59.470 --> 01:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
limited income and there are not enough
 
01:26:02.109 --> 01:26:02.119 align:start position:0%
units that are affordable for them
 
01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
however we also learned that there were
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
issues that were specific to the
 
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
population with developmental
 
01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities a few decades ago we turned
 
01:26:12.669 --> 01:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
away from institutionalization for
 
01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
children with developmental disabilities
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
instead they lived with their families
 
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
attended their local public school and
 
01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
grew up as part of their communities as
 
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
a result we've learned what they are
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
capable of there continues to be a wide
 
01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
range of needs some need 247 care but
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
others hold jobs volunteer socialize and
 
01:26:35.470 --> 01:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
are active contributors to to their
 
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
communities most of them continue to
 
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
live with their parents who are aging
 
01:26:43.470 --> 01:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
and that has the parents very concerned
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
the time has come for us to develop new
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
models of housing for adults with
 
01:26:49.229 --> 01:26:49.239 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities who need
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
varying levels of support the good news
 
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
is that the parents have stepped up in
 
01:26:55.950 --> 01:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
are willing to use their own talents and
 
01:26:58.430 --> 01:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
resources to leverage available funds to
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
create these new models of Supportive
 
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
Housing and this bill is the first step
 
01:27:04.669 --> 01:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
in removing some of the barriers that
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
they have encountered and I hope you
 
01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
will support this bill I mean for
 
01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
example we've been talking about this um
 
01:27:15.070 --> 01:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
mixed development um there is a specific
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
rule that um refers to people with
 
01:27:20.830 --> 01:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities saying that
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
no more than three people with
 
01:27:25.629 --> 01:27:25.639 align:start position:0%
developmental disabil ities can be Under
 
01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:28.719 align:start position:0%
One Roof so what that means is if you
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
have a 20 un apartment building and you
 
01:27:33.109 --> 01:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
set aside five of those units for people
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
with developmental disabilities even
 
01:27:37.229 --> 01:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
though there's only one or two people
 
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
living in each one of those apartments
 
01:27:40.990 --> 01:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
that would mean that the entire building
 
01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
would need to be licensed which means
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
the owner would have to fill out rings
 
01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
of paperwork they would need an elevator
 
01:27:49.709 --> 01:27:49.719 align:start position:0%
that would support a hospital gurnie um
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
and so the the cost of the development
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
of the of the building would be higher
 
01:27:58.590 --> 01:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
and the um uh the level of paperwork and
 
01:28:00.430 --> 01:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
other things that would be required to
 
01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
maintain the building would also be
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
increased and and you know
 
01:28:07.870 --> 01:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
for uh for you know this is this is
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
really loow hanging fruit here is to
 
01:28:12.109 --> 01:28:12.119 align:start position:0%
just kind of remove that distinction so
 
01:28:14.669 --> 01:28:14.679 align:start position:0%
that we can create these mixed
 
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
communities where people with
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities can live in
 
01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
the community be have access to
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
transportation and amenities and um um
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
and services um but you know and but and
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
and um and and not not force their
 
01:28:37.629 --> 01:28:37.639 align:start position:0%
landlord to have to fill out rings of
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
paperwork and develop um um you know all
 
01:28:45.390 --> 01:28:45.400 align:start position:0%
the building really as as a as as some
 
01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
kind of a health care facility so that's
 
01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
that's why we're looking at this it's
 
01:28:55.229 --> 01:28:55.239 align:start position:0%
just one little thing sure any
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative palazov uh
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
so um two parts like first to follow up
 
01:29:11.709 --> 01:29:11.719 align:start position:0%
on uh representative cofal question
 
01:29:14.830 --> 01:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh if there would be a further amendment
 
01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:17.719 align:start position:0%
to this bill uh I I also would like to
 
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
see some clear list to understand like
 
01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
like in Amendment I'm not sure if we are
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
talking about two types or three types
 
01:29:30.109 --> 01:29:30.119 align:start position:0%
of facilities or four types so some list
 
01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
would be helpful and question is you you
 
01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:35.950 align:start position:0%
would be helpful and question is you you
mention

01:29:35.950 --> 01:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
mention
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
affordability so do you have any
 
01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:40.229 align:start position:0%
affordability so do you have any
estimate

01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
of uh this licensing cost burden how
 
01:29:49.390 --> 01:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
much it adds um I do not um um there are
 
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
folks who have been working on
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
developing these kinds of um uh
 
01:29:55.109 --> 01:29:55.119 align:start position:0%
facilities or these kinds of buildings
 
01:29:59.709 --> 01:29:59.719 align:start position:0%
or um housing um developments who um
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
will come after me who have been
 
01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
investigating this at at more in more
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
detail I
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
um I will send everyone the preliminary
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
report from our committee so you can see
 
01:30:14.109 --> 01:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
um what kinds of information we
 
01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
uncovered when we talked to folks um so
 
01:30:20.590 --> 01:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
I do not have that information um and um
 
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of of of the cost um burden but
 
01:30:27.870 --> 01:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
we did hear about it um in in terms of
 
01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment um you know we have been
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
working with Duran sharle and I think
 
01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
that she may come forward with some
 
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
ideas of how to clarify that but
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
basically the idea is that you know if
 
01:30:42.430 --> 01:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
you're living if you're living in your
 
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
own apartment and you're bringing in um
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
outside agencies to um you know to
 
01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
provide services for you whether it's
 
01:30:54.109 --> 01:30:54.119 align:start position:0%
you know you you need help with take
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
your medications or you need help with
 
01:30:58.350 --> 01:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
cleaning or whatever if that's being
 
01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:01.400 align:start position:0%
done with an outside agency then that's
 
01:31:03.629 --> 01:31:03.639 align:start position:0%
one class of housing that that will be
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
available and that's what this bill is
 
01:31:08.910 --> 01:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
looking at um whereas you know the the
 
01:31:11.109 --> 01:31:11.119 align:start position:0%
more complicated one is the more let's
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
call it
 
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
allinclusive um where you know you're
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
living in the building and all the
 
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
services that you need are being
 
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
provided by the owner of the building so
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
that's more complicated and and um joran
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
shley can probably provide more um
 
01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
background into how complicated it would
 
01:31:33.430 --> 01:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
be a lot of this um these rules come
 
01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
come to us from CMS and you know we
 
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
don't want people to be in violation of
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
the rules that are coming from CMS about
 
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
people with developmental disabilities
 
01:31:45.229 --> 01:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
when they're trying to provide housing
 
01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
for people you know they they're they're
 
01:31:51.669 --> 01:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
young they're they have jobs they have
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
lives they just you know they just want
 
01:31:55.229 --> 01:31:55.239 align:start position:0%
to continue and their parents want to
 
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that once their parents are
 
01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
gone that they're in in in safe and safe
 
01:32:03.109 --> 01:32:03.119 align:start position:0%
and stable housing so that you know
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
they're not going to you know they they
 
01:32:07.709 --> 01:32:07.719 align:start position:0%
want what we want for our kids they want
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
we want them to be safe we want them to
 
01:32:11.629 --> 01:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
be happy and that's what we're hoping to
 
01:32:14.189 --> 01:32:14.199 align:start position:0%
accomplish with um making this small
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
change to you know really kind of pick
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
off this loow hanging fruit that's
 
01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:19.400 align:start position:0%
preventing people from building
 
01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate housing for adults with
 
01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:22.669 align:start position:0%
appropriate housing for adults with
developmental

01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
developmental
 
01:32:27.109 --> 01:32:27.119 align:start position:0%
disabilities okay thank you any other

model of housing for adults with ID to
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
be created in New Hampshire and I want
 
01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
to shout out a big thank you to the
 
01:33:28.990 --> 01:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
committee that worked on this the uh
 
01:33:30.990 --> 01:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
committee to study the impact of the
 
01:33:32.189 --> 01:33:32.199 align:start position:0%
housing crisis on people with
 
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
disabilities and the uh staff members
 
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
from DHHS who have worked with them
 
01:33:39.310 --> 01:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
also our place New Hampshire has been
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
working with a developer from New York
 
01:33:42.669 --> 01:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
and Jessica talked about this already a
 
01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
little bit he's created large Workforce
 
01:33:47.229 --> 01:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
housing apartments uh apartment projects
 
01:33:50.229 --> 01:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
with 40 to 50 units and he reserves 25%
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
of the units for adults with ID within
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
each project there's a common area where
 
01:33:56.189 --> 01:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
all tenants are invited for activities
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
such as art classes movie nights and
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
yoga this is a great way to facilitate
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
the inclusion of individuals with ID the
 
01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
project also provides offices for
 
01:34:07.390 --> 01:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
service providers within the building
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
the tenants with ID have 247 Staffing
 
01:34:13.109 --> 01:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
and the services are provided to those
 
01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
who choose to have their services
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
delivered by the agency in the
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
building House Bill 731 would help make
 
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
this type of project possible in New
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by amending RSA 151 colon 2
 
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
and allowing the individual units to be
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
certified for provision of services to
 
01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
this population rather than requiring
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
licensing of the entire building this
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
sensible change will make it much more
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
costeffective for the developer there is
 
01:34:41.149 --> 01:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
some language in the amendment to this
 
01:34:43.229 --> 01:34:43.239 align:start position:0%
bill that I hope will be changed before
 
01:34:45.390 --> 01:34:45.400 align:start position:0%
it goes to Executive session as the
 
01:34:47.229 --> 01:34:47.239 align:start position:0%
wording implies that the tenants would
 
01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
have to be on participant directed
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
manage services which is you'll have to
 
01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
learn about that but there's different
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
typ of services in New Hampshire and the
 
01:34:58.669 --> 01:34:58.679 align:start position:0%
amendment implies that people will have
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
um be
 
01:35:03.149 --> 01:35:03.159 align:start position:0%
self-directed and that is not the how
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
the model the that I'm looking at works
 
01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
so there is another model of budget use
 
01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
which is called the hm11 budgets and in
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
those budgets you can combine services
 
01:35:17.310 --> 01:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
so for instance if you have 10 people
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
living together they all pay on Tenth of
 
01:35:22.109 --> 01:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
the overnight staff so you have to be
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
able to use these medic paid budgets
 
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:35:29.229 --> 01:35:29.239 align:start position:0%
combinable anyway HB 731 is a step in
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
the right direction um I'm disappointed
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
that this bill does not make it easier
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
for some of the smaller projects like
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
ours um that are existing or proposed
 
01:35:40.510 --> 01:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have to jump
 
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
through the hurdles of Licensing um but
 
01:35:45.149 --> 01:35:45.159 align:start position:0%
as someone else said ahead of me maybe
 
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
the the appropriate way to go is to work
 
01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
on those licensing requirements to make
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
them a little easier for projects like
 
01:35:54.510 --> 01:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
us um so please pass this Bill and I'm
 
01:35:57.310 --> 01:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
ready to take any questions thank you
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Palazo
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:36:05.790 --> 01:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
my question could you speak a little bit
 
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
about those licensing requirements uh
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
what they are as they add to safety and
 
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
what is estimated cost of complying with
 
01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:16.390 align:start position:0%
what is estimated cost of complying with
those

01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
requirements okay because we have not
 
01:36:20.590 --> 01:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
actually developed our project yet I
 
01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
can't give you exact numbers but I can
 
01:36:25.149 --> 01:36:25.159 align:start position:0%
tell you that when you have to go
 
01:36:25.159 --> 01:36:26.229 align:start position:0%
tell you that when you have to go
through

01:36:26.229 --> 01:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
lure um there are there are a little
 
01:36:33.070 --> 01:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
more stringent um demands for you know
 
01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
fire uh safety things but not much we
 
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
have to have a sprinkler system I know
 
01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
that um but there are some things that
 
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
were mentioned before like having to
 
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
have an elevator um some of the
 
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
licensure requirements like in a health
 
01:36:47.629 --> 01:36:47.639 align:start position:0%
care facility you have to have toilets
 
01:36:50.709 --> 01:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
that can hold up an 800 lb person um
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
many of these things you know could be
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
waved so working on the actual
 
01:36:57.629 --> 01:36:57.639 align:start position:0%
lure um rules themselves might be able
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
to pair down some of those expenses um
 
01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that
 
01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:04.189 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that
[Music]

01:37:04.189 --> 01:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
um lure requires more documentation so
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
not only do you have to uh clean your
 
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
stove hoods over the stove every month
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the grease isn't there
 
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
but you have to have a notebook with a
 
01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
chart in it that shows that you've
 
01:37:21.550 --> 01:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
cleaned those stove hoods so somebody
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
has to be in charge of that so there's a
 
01:37:26.910 --> 01:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
lot more documentation um required for
 
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:39.790 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
than

01:37:39.790 --> 01:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Doren
 
01:37:44.189 --> 01:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
shley from the Department of Health and
 
01:37:44.199 --> 01:37:48.750 align:start position:0%
shley from the Department of Health and
Human

01:37:48.750 --> 01:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
Services been hearing a lot about you
 
01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
from previous
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
speakers good morning chairman McDonald
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
committee members having heard my name
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
over six times I thought it might be a
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
good idea to come come up um I hadn't
 
01:38:04.910 --> 01:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
planned on testifying but um I do
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate this opportunity very much
 
01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
this morning and as has been said I've
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
worked very closely with stakeholders
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
across the state as well as the
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
committee um i' want to spend very brief
 
01:38:21.149 --> 01:38:21.159 align:start position:0%
of time but I do want to let you know
 
01:38:22.910 --> 01:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
that this conversation and if you're
 
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
feeling that this is complex and
 
01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
difficult to kind of grasp it is um I've
 
01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
been working on it with folks in the
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
community since December of 2022 so um
 
01:38:36.189 --> 01:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
that gives you some some um information
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
as to how long this conversation has
 
01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:41.320 align:start position:0%
been going on it was in 2023 that Lori
 
01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
and her team came forward with a model
 
01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to use in Dover um in
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
you've heard about that this morning um
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
25% independent folks and then um some
 
01:38:55.589 --> 01:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
or just the opposite 25% are those that
 
01:38:57.390 --> 01:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
are going to be receiving services and
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
the rest would be independent and as the
 
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
law is written now we would be required
 
01:39:05.870 --> 01:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
to license that facility that Resident
 
01:39:09.149 --> 01:39:09.159 align:start position:0%
um I encouraged them at that time to
 
01:39:11.950 --> 01:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
seek a sponsor to change the law because
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not something the
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
department wants to have regulatory
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
oversight on a place where there's a
 
01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
mixed use of um so that's why we're here
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
today um I've heard a couple comments
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
about the bill as originally written and
 
01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
as originally written if you would um
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
look at line
 
01:39:36.910 --> 01:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
nine leasable unit providing complete
 
01:39:40.149 --> 01:39:40.159 align:start position:0%
and independent living facilities well
 
01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
those don't need to be licensed now so
 
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
this bill was in fact accomplishing
 
01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
nothing in terms of this population
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
which is why I then reached out to the
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
committee and said okay so based on the
 
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
feedback that we received through all
 
01:39:56.709 --> 01:39:56.719 align:start position:0%
the sessions this is not accomplishing
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
what was originally intended therefore I
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
made some suggestions to the language
 
01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
was which is what you're looking at in
 
01:40:05.669 --> 01:40:05.679 align:start position:0%
the amendment um I do understand there
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
were conversations last night in terms
 
01:40:11.229 --> 01:40:11.239 align:start position:0%
of maybe providing um a little bit more
 
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
clarity um which we are certainly
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
willing to do in terms of um it is our
 
01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:20.360 align:start position:0%
position that this does in fact um it's
 
01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
a small step but it's also a big step I
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
know that doesn't make sense um but
 
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
having worked on this for close to 3
 
01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
years um I'm excited to see that we are
 
01:40:33.070 --> 01:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
going to make some changes I hope that
 
01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
we can amend the language somewhat um we
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
have more work to do unfortunately this
 
01:40:40.270 --> 01:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
committee is engaged for another year
 
01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
which is not ordinary it's usually one
 
01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
year and we have two years and I've
 
01:40:45.390 --> 01:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
already spoken to the State Fire
 
01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
Marshall's office this morning they are
 
01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
willing to engage in conversations to
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
carve out more of the larger
 
01:40:54.109 --> 01:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
environments that may also want to be
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
exempt that um we don't want to do that
 
01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
now because it will have unintended
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
consequences but once we engage with
 
01:41:03.189 --> 01:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
local authorities and State Fire
 
01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
Marshal's office we might be able to um
 
01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:07.629 align:start position:0%
Marshal's office we might be able to um
exempt

01:41:07.629 --> 01:41:07.639 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
01:41:10.510 --> 01:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
additional I think that's all I have do
 
01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
you have any questions thank you uh any
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr
 
01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
chairman uh since you're from the
 
01:41:23.669 --> 01:41:23.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try again
 
01:41:31.109 --> 01:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
I so there's no confusion I support this
 
01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
legislation uh however it it's a larger
 
01:41:35.599 --> 01:41:37.310 align:start position:0%
legislation uh however it it's a larger
problem

01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
than than the one that's addressed in
 
01:41:41.199 --> 01:41:43.470 align:start position:0%
than than the one that's addressed in
this

01:41:43.470 --> 01:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and it's a it's a major
 
01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
issue for our state there's no question
 
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
about it in terms of
 
01:41:56.070 --> 01:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
housing it is there some way that the
 
01:41:59.070 --> 01:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
department uh through the oversight
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
committee uh uh could begin to look at
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
this in a more
 
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
comprehensive way uh what I'm concerned
 
01:42:12.589 --> 01:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
about is one group competing against
 
01:42:15.270 --> 01:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
another and what we could have which
 
01:42:18.750 --> 01:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
powerful issue would be support coming
 
01:42:24.910 --> 01:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
from all of the these different groups
 
01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:25.709 align:start position:0%
from all of the these different groups
who

01:42:25.709 --> 01:42:25.719 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
are uh in in conquered we have a very
 
01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
serious housing problem and we just
 
01:42:40.350 --> 01:42:40.360 align:start position:0%
recently uh shut down one of the uh
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
biggest um
 
01:42:48.350 --> 01:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
homeless uh uh aspects in our city and
 
01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
where those people go is beyond me uh so
 
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
I I would
 
01:42:58.030 --> 01:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh as much as I support this I support a
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
larger concept that deals with all of
 
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
the aspects of our housing issue do you
 
01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
have any comments um thank you
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
representative McKay um I failed to
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
introduce myself I am the um manager of
 
01:43:14.750 --> 01:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Licensing and
 
01:43:18.430 --> 01:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
certification at the department and um I
 
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
I think it's important and I and you
 
01:43:22.030 --> 01:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
rais a very important point and I and I
 
01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I I think it's important
 
01:43:25.589 --> 01:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
to note that the population of
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
individuals that we're speaking about
 
01:43:30.510 --> 01:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
today are are already in the system at
 
01:43:32.430 --> 01:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
the department in terms of the Bureau of
 
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
Developmental Services they're already
 
01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
receiving services and we also certify
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
the housing which I think um
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
representative Lamont um described
 
01:43:44.350 --> 01:43:44.360 align:start position:0%
there's a certification process um and
 
01:43:46.629 --> 01:43:46.639 align:start position:0%
then there's a licensing process um in
 
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
terms of a more comprehensive way to um
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
deal with our housing crisis I think
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
um I certainly would believe that the
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
department would be certainly supportive
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
of that I don't know if there's already
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
is there a committee that's working on
 
01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
that I don't know I think um
 
01:44:07.589 --> 01:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
representative Missour is saying yes um
 
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
I would imagine that there is a
 
01:44:10.990 --> 01:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
committee um I would be happy to
 
01:44:13.229 --> 01:44:13.239 align:start position:0%
contribute to that to the extent that my
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
Bureau would be you know would have an
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
impact on that um I know this committee
 
01:44:20.830 --> 01:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
was um focused um primarily on those
 
01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
with disabilities and how the housing
 
01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
crisis was impacting that population of
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
individuals I hope that answers your
 
01:44:32.350 --> 01:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative plaz
 
01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
off and then representative Woods uh
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um if you could go uh
 
01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
through the list and just help uh
 
01:44:45.189 --> 01:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
understand what uh uh I counted four
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
types uh of uh um facilities here and um
 
01:44:55.229 --> 01:44:55.239 align:start position:0%
like C second one is three or few few is
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
at a
 
01:44:59.790 --> 01:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
certified but then line nine talks about
 
01:45:01.709 --> 01:45:01.719 align:start position:0%
three or more
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
individuals so like I'm not sure if like
 
01:45:06.750 --> 01:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
third type and fourth type
 
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh are they certified like so
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
if you could just like quickly go like
 
01:45:19.149 --> 01:45:19.159 align:start position:0%
what kind of facilities this bill uh uh
 
01:45:22.669 --> 01:45:22.679 align:start position:0%
affect uh in terms of a list okay thank
 
01:45:23.589 --> 01:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:45:25.870 --> 01:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
um so if I understand you want me to
 
01:45:27.709 --> 01:45:27.719 align:start position:0%
describe what the amended bill is
 
01:45:30.030 --> 01:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
accomplishing okay um first the bill
 
01:45:34.510 --> 01:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
would amend RSA 151 colon 2 Roman 2A by
 
01:45:37.109 --> 01:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
adding a license exemption for buildings
 
01:45:39.709 --> 01:45:39.719 align:start position:0%
that provide residences to both
 
01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
independent individuals and individuals
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
receiving services this is important for
 
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire because there
 
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
already as we've heard structures that
 
01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
fall within this definition like
 
01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
apartment likee structures um and
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
currently those are those are requiring
 
01:45:58.510 --> 01:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
lure so this bill would change that
 
01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
secondly the bill would amend RSA 151
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
colon 2 Roman 2A by adding another
 
01:46:07.229 --> 01:46:07.239 align:start position:0%
license exemption to any entity that
 
01:46:09.149 --> 01:46:09.159 align:start position:0%
provides housing to three or more
 
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
individuals receiving Services provided
 
01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
that the entity does not provide or
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
arrange for those personal assistance or
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
any health related um it creates an
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
exemption for entities that are
 
01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
providing housing to three or more
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
people but but the individuals are
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
managing their own services this I
 
01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
believe is language that last night in a
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
discussion was um um there was some
 
01:46:32.589 --> 01:46:32.599 align:start position:0%
concern that the way that the language
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
that I suggested may be prohibitive so I
 
01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
think there was some suggested language
 
01:46:40.270 --> 01:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
that the department would absolutely um
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
um consider um we our our goal is to
 
01:46:47.950 --> 01:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
help increase the exemptions so that
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's more opportunities not diminish
 
01:46:54.709 --> 01:46:54.719 align:start position:0%
those resentative Woods thank you Mr
 
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:46:59.070 --> 01:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
question uh the original uh Bill uh had
 
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
no fiscal impact uh from what you've
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
described and what you anticipate some
 
01:47:06.589 --> 01:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
changes uh could you comment uh on the
 
01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact uh in general I obviously
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
you can't give details but uh would that
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
change dramatically or not um thank you
 
01:47:18.589 --> 01:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
for the question representative Woods
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
the original as written Bill had no
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
impact because it didn't accomplish
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
anything um um I shouldn't say it didn't
 
01:47:27.070 --> 01:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
accomplish anything sorry that was not
 
01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
what I meant I meant it was they're
 
01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
already exempt so it had no impact I
 
01:47:33.629 --> 01:47:33.639 align:start position:0%
don't really see the second um with the
 
01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
amendment will also if anything um it
 
01:47:40.189 --> 01:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
would I mean I so I have two teams well
 
01:47:42.030 --> 01:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
I have more than two teams but two teams
 
01:47:45.149 --> 01:47:45.159 align:start position:0%
that would be impacted by this bill a
 
01:47:47.189 --> 01:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
licensing team and the certification
 
01:47:50.189 --> 01:47:50.199 align:start position:0%
team the certification team is already
 
01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
working with all of these types of
 
01:47:55.470 --> 01:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
entities um the the change would be that
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
licensing would not be so if anything
 
01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
there would be less fiscal impact to the
 
01:48:02.350 --> 01:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
department not
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
more other
 
01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no other questions
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:13.950 --> 01:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
you no one else has signed up to testify
 
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
on HB 731 FN does anyone else wish to
 
01:48:22.030 --> 01:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
testify if there if none there is no one
 
01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
then I'm going to close the public
 
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill again HP 731 FN I'm
 
01:48:28.510 --> 01:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing we
 
01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:30.639 align:start position:0%

the house committee on Health and Human
 
02:07:45.270 --> 02:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
Services and elderly Affairs the next
 
02:07:47.390 --> 02:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
bill scheduled to to be heard this uh
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
today is House Bill

02:08:02.950 --> 02:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
Lon thank you Mr chairman and members of
 
02:08:05.109 --> 02:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
the committee and uh hello again to all
 
02:08:06.270 --> 02:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
of you I've served with in this
 
02:08:08.910 --> 02:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
Committee in the past um I am here to
 
02:08:10.990 --> 02:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill
 
02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
117 um which was originally brought
 
02:08:15.669 --> 02:08:15.679 align:start position:0%
forward by another former member of this
 
02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
committee representative Gary Merchant
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
um he is a pharmacist and was a former
 
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
chair of the New Hampshire Board of
 
02:08:25.470 --> 02:08:25.480 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy and a very knowledgeable man in
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
this area this bill is actually a lot
 
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
more simple than it seems right now
 
02:08:34.149 --> 02:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
there may be some movement in Washington
 
02:08:38.270 --> 02:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
DC and the FDA to recognize what other
 
02:08:40.990 --> 02:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
areas have always realized that there's
 
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
not really a difference between
 
02:08:45.629 --> 02:08:45.639 align:start position:0%
interchangeable and biosimilar other
 
02:08:47.950 --> 02:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
than a regulatory pathway that provides
 
02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
some protect protection for the first
 
02:08:53.310 --> 02:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
entrance into the market Market um when
 
02:08:55.510 --> 02:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
you have a we have some other people
 
02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
here that can talk to a lot of the
 
02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
science on the biologics and biosimilars
 
02:09:00.589 --> 02:09:00.599 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to stay on the very
 
02:09:03.390 --> 02:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
very top level of this uh basically
 
02:09:06.030 --> 02:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
biologics are we're talking about large
 
02:09:08.189 --> 02:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
molecules not little small molecules
 
02:09:10.189 --> 02:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
like aspirin and we're talking about
 
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
things that are grown and not produced
 
02:09:15.390 --> 02:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
um in a chemistry set so it's a
 
02:09:17.629 --> 02:09:17.639 align:start position:0%
different process than generic drugs
 
02:09:19.229 --> 02:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
generic small molecules and the
 
02:09:22.589 --> 02:09:22.599 align:start position:0%
biosimilars are similar but not not
 
02:09:25.629 --> 02:09:25.639 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as generics um so back
 
02:09:27.390 --> 02:09:27.400 align:start position:0%
when I was an analyst uh covering some
 
02:09:29.069 --> 02:09:29.079 align:start position:0%
of the big companies that make drugs
 
02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
like Huma I was kind of worried for
 
02:09:32.830 --> 02:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
investors about what was going to happen
 
02:09:35.149 --> 02:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
with these biosimilars um there was a
 
02:09:37.149 --> 02:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
program that came around that said that
 
02:09:39.069 --> 02:09:39.079 align:start position:0%
when you have one of these drugs you go
 
02:09:41.109 --> 02:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
and you do a pretty big test and you
 
02:09:42.750 --> 02:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
switch people back and forth just to
 
02:09:44.750 --> 02:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're not any different
 
02:09:47.030 --> 02:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
the thing is in order for a biosimilar
 
02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
to be approved at all you need to do a
 
02:09:51.390 --> 02:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
lot of tests that show that you
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
statistically can't find a difference
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
between the original biologic and the
 
02:09:58.589 --> 02:09:58.599 align:start position:0%
new biosimilar um this is a process
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's been going on for nearly two
 
02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
decades and in Europe there was never a
 
02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
difference between interchangeable and
 
02:10:08.549 --> 02:10:08.559 align:start position:0%
biosimilars there's been quite a good
 
02:10:12.109 --> 02:10:12.119 align:start position:0%
deal of guidance saying that there's not
 
02:10:14.350 --> 02:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
not a difference between interchangeable
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
and biosimilar except in the US
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
regulatory scheme and I can send quite a
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
bit of information to anybody who really
 
02:10:24.549 --> 02:10:24.559 align:start position:0%
wants to get into the details on this
 
02:10:26.350 --> 02:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
but I also didn't want to fledge you
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
with papers um so at this point there's
 
02:10:31.870 --> 02:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
been some draft guidance circulated by
 
02:10:35.470 --> 02:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
the FDA that may um sort of change the
 
02:10:37.310 --> 02:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
way that interchangeable drugs in
 
02:10:39.669 --> 02:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
interchangeable biosimilars are treated
 
02:10:41.109 --> 02:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
um we don't know when they'll act on it
 
02:10:42.629 --> 02:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
because unlike the state of New
 
02:10:44.270 --> 02:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the federal government doesn't
 
02:10:46.990 --> 02:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
set time limits on when they need to act
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
on recommendations you know it'd be a
 
02:10:50.310 --> 02:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
better world if they did but not
 
02:10:52.990 --> 02:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
everybody can govern like conquered does
 
02:10:56.669 --> 02:10:56.679 align:start position:0%
um so if the FDA decides that you no
 
02:10:59.270 --> 02:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
longer need to have a switching study in
 
02:11:02.430 --> 02:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
order to substitute biologics um it
 
02:11:04.910 --> 02:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't meet our current definition of
 
02:11:07.589 --> 02:11:07.599 align:start position:0%
interchangeable products in the bill in
 
02:11:10.350 --> 02:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
front of you on line oh I don't have
 
02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
line numbers on mine but in section
 
02:11:16.030 --> 02:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
three that would allow that if the FDA
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
adopts another way to have what is in
 
02:11:21.790 --> 02:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
essence uh interchangeable biologic that
 
02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
would allow the New Hampshire law to
 
02:11:27.069 --> 02:11:27.079 align:start position:0%
adapt alongside With The fda's Changes
 
02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
because right now our language could
 
02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
lightly lock Us in and leave us behind
 
02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
the times and this matters a lot for our
 
02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:37.599 align:start position:0%
our constituents um I was actually
 
02:11:39.750 --> 02:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
talking to one of my neighbors who is a
 
02:11:41.390 --> 02:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
great guy I didn't really think I was
 
02:11:42.709 --> 02:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
going to get into the science of
 
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
biologics with him but he was telling me
 
02:11:46.069 --> 02:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
about how
 
02:11:48.390 --> 02:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
lifechanging um some of these drugs are
 
02:11:51.030 --> 02:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
for him and how expensive they are and
 
02:11:52.709 --> 02:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
how the biosimilars have made a
 
02:11:54.629 --> 02:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
significant difference in his life by
 
02:11:57.910 --> 02:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
being able to not pay the Branded
 
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
price if we adopt this and if the FDA
 
02:12:03.430 --> 02:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
makes the moves needed so that this
 
02:12:05.390 --> 02:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
actually becomes effective for us here
 
02:12:07.870 --> 02:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire this would mean that if
 
02:12:10.830 --> 02:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
you show up and you have the original
 
02:12:13.470 --> 02:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
drug the the Gucci one whatever the
 
02:12:17.189 --> 02:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
fancy one is that costs $1,000 a month
 
02:12:20.030 --> 02:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
um you have the biosimilar that your
 
02:12:22.830 --> 02:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
doctor wrote you a description for which
 
02:12:26.549 --> 02:12:26.559 align:start position:0%
is biosimilar a that costs you $600 a
 
02:12:28.950 --> 02:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
month and if you're pharmacist can get
 
02:12:32.109 --> 02:12:32.119 align:start position:0%
you biosimilar B which right now only
 
02:12:35.229 --> 02:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
cost you $200 a month or $400 a month
 
02:12:37.870 --> 02:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist can talk with you and say
 
02:12:40.390 --> 02:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know these are going to be no
 
02:12:42.510 --> 02:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
different in your body when we've tested
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
them they're no different um they're not
 
02:12:45.669 --> 02:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
they're not provably different and
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
they're no different than different runs
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
would be of the biologic so we can do
 
02:12:51.629 --> 02:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
this and if you want to save this amount
 
02:12:53.390 --> 02:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
of money we can switch you and there's
 
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
not going to be a difference in your
 
02:12:58.350 --> 02:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
treatment because by definition a
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
biosimilar has that same effect um so
 
02:13:03.669 --> 02:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
this would really Empower pharmacists to
 
02:13:05.669 --> 02:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
help our constituents save money at a
 
02:13:07.870 --> 02:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
time when we're all struggling and this
 
02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't move ahead of the FDA it would
 
02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
just allow us to sort of drift draft
 
02:13:15.310 --> 02:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
right along them if they change these
 
02:13:17.350 --> 02:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
requirements we can follow right along
 
02:13:20.109 --> 02:13:20.119 align:start position:0%
and implement it as soon as as soon as
 
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
they do that make that move move and so
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
I think the biggest part too is you may
 
02:13:26.669 --> 02:13:26.679 align:start position:0%
end up hearing about some harms from
 
02:13:28.830 --> 02:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
biosimilars um there's a great reporting
 
02:13:31.790 --> 02:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
program 1800 bad drug if somebody tells
 
02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
you that somebody was harmed by a
 
02:13:35.390 --> 02:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
biosimilar the first question should ask
 
02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
you should ask is when did you report
 
02:13:39.830 --> 02:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
this to the FDA you can call 1 1800 bad
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
drug if somebody hasn't reported it but
 
02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
they're telling you that about a about a
 
02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
bad event a bad outcome I would question
 
02:13:49.990 --> 02:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
that because if there's really a problem
 
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
the first people they should call it The
 
02:13:53.870 --> 02:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
Regulators to help keep patients safe um
 
02:13:57.950 --> 02:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
secondly the FTC and the FDA H are
 
02:13:59.470 --> 02:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
working together to make sure that
 
02:14:02.510 --> 02:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
there's not misinformation on biological
 
02:14:05.189 --> 02:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
products um there's you may end up
 
02:14:06.549 --> 02:14:06.559 align:start position:0%
hearing from people about something
 
02:14:10.149 --> 02:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
called a nobo um it's like a placebo but
 
02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
people are very afraid that when they
 
02:14:14.750 --> 02:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
change from Blue to Red there's going to
 
02:14:16.510 --> 02:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
be a noticeable noticeable difference
 
02:14:19.030 --> 02:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
when there's not um when people who
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
should know better feed into that it's
 
02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
problem and the FTC has said that that
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
may be anti-competitive in order to
 
02:14:30.830 --> 02:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
spread doubt and concern about the the
 
02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
clinical efficacy of these drugs um so
 
02:14:37.790 --> 02:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
when I reviewed the comments on the FDA
 
02:14:39.950 --> 02:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
the potential change in FDA guidance
 
02:14:41.470 --> 02:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
where all you would need to do is
 
02:14:43.149 --> 02:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
scientifically prove that they're the
 
02:14:45.189 --> 02:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
same without having to put them through
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
people and change them uh because at
 
02:14:49.510 --> 02:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
this point the science is there um there
 
02:14:52.510 --> 02:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
were 28 people that SP that 28
 
02:14:54.069 --> 02:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
organizations are people that provided
 
02:14:56.589 --> 02:14:56.599 align:start position:0%
information a lot of the very highlevel
 
02:14:58.470 --> 02:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
scientific and medical organizations
 
02:15:00.629 --> 02:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
like the American Medical Association
 
02:15:02.270 --> 02:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
and the American Society for clinical
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
oncology support the change because they
 
02:15:08.510 --> 02:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
understand the science that we know with
 
02:15:10.229 --> 02:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
the tests that we now have available
 
02:15:12.510 --> 02:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
that weren't available 15 years ago when
 
02:15:14.709 --> 02:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
this first happened they know that it's
 
02:15:17.149 --> 02:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
going to not going to have a difference
 
02:15:19.350 --> 02:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
in the human body and it's not going to
 
02:15:22.270 --> 02:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
make a medical difference for patients
 
02:15:24.030 --> 02:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
it'll just make a financial difference
 
02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
because if you can't afford your
 
02:15:28.470 --> 02:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
drug that could have life-ending
 
02:15:31.830 --> 02:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
consequences for you um there were
 
02:15:33.950 --> 02:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
there's different organizations a lot of
 
02:15:35.950 --> 02:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
this is why the FTC is working with the
 
02:15:38.350 --> 02:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
FDA to make sure that the information
 
02:15:41.589 --> 02:15:41.599 align:start position:0%
that's presented is clear and convincing
 
02:15:44.189 --> 02:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
and doesn't lead into fear and concern
 
02:15:46.629 --> 02:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
when it should not exist uh because
 
02:15:47.950 --> 02:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
goodness knows there's enough things we
 
02:15:49.629 --> 02:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
need to worry about in this world we
 
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
don't need to add non problems to worry
 
02:15:54.750 --> 02:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
about so with this
 
02:15:57.069 --> 02:15:57.079 align:start position:0%
um I would ask for your support of this
 
02:15:59.430 --> 02:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
bill because it allows us to move along
 
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
with medical and Regulatory Innovation
 
02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
at the federal level when it comes
 
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
forward and uh it's the right thing to
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
do to impact Financial tesity so I'm
 
02:16:09.950 --> 02:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
ready for any questions thank you
 
02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:11.229 align:start position:0%
ready for any questions thank you
representative

02:16:11.229 --> 02:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:16:14.189 --> 02:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
wber thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
bringing the bill to us and thank you
 
02:16:19.149 --> 02:16:19.159 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:16:23.589 --> 02:16:23.599 align:start position:0%
um and I just noticing on page two this
 
02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
also includes a patient uh prerogative
 
02:16:32.429 --> 02:16:32.439 align:start position:0%
sentence so if the patient informs the
 
02:16:33.990 --> 02:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacist that he or she doesn't want
 
02:16:36.669 --> 02:16:36.679 align:start position:0%
to wish doesn't wish to receive an
 
02:16:39.669 --> 02:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
interchangeable biological product they
 
02:16:42.309 --> 02:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
don't have to they can go with the
 
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
original and so it's up to the patient
 
02:16:47.110 --> 02:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
to make the tradeoff
 
02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
between the price how they feel what
 
02:16:53.709 --> 02:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
whatever is go whatever else is going on
 
02:16:56.629 --> 02:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
correct correct and um that may also
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
lead to us a patient deciding that even
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
if the one that's been prescribed isn't
 
02:17:02.589 --> 02:17:02.599 align:start position:0%
available they'd rather just wait or
 
02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
find a different Pharmacy because that's
 
02:17:06.669 --> 02:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
their right um but if they wanted to
 
02:17:09.910 --> 02:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
change they'd be able to okay thank you
 
02:17:13.150 --> 02:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:17:17.790 --> 02:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so bear with me
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
because I'm still trying to understand
 
02:17:21.870 --> 02:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:17:25.790 --> 02:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm reading like you said lines 22
 
02:17:28.389 --> 02:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
to 24 um
 
02:17:32.150 --> 02:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
so do you is is the FDA working on that
 
02:17:34.349 --> 02:17:34.359 align:start position:0%
already and what what exactly is the
 
02:17:35.790 --> 02:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
nature of the change that they would
 
02:17:37.790 --> 02:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
just say we're going to liens this
 
02:17:39.790 --> 02:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
biological but we're not going to say
 
02:17:41.910 --> 02:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's interchangeable who is going to
 
02:17:42.990 --> 02:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
make that
 
02:17:45.070 --> 02:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
determination that it meets the
 
02:17:47.469 --> 02:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
definition of an interchangeable I'm
 
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
just trying to kind of are they where's
 
02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
the definition coming from if it's not
 
02:17:54.349 --> 02:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm saying so you could
 
02:17:56.709 --> 02:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
just clarify and if they are working on
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
it how imminent do you believe it is uh
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so there are
 
02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
several different moving pieces back in
 
02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
2009 they had the original legislation
 
02:18:09.549 --> 02:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
that allowed for the the bio bio
 
02:18:11.830 --> 02:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
similars um and allowed for some of the
 
02:18:14.429 --> 02:18:14.439 align:start position:0%
transparency around it and when the the
 
02:18:17.870 --> 02:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
FDA implemented this where if you had
 
02:18:21.469 --> 02:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
the copy molecule or copy
 
02:18:25.309 --> 02:18:25.319 align:start position:0%
um the copy biologic and you did a
 
02:18:28.030 --> 02:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
switching study on patients if you ran
 
02:18:29.549 --> 02:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
that did the switching study and
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
submitted for an interchangeable
 
02:18:33.709 --> 02:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
designation nobody else could come up on
 
02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
your heels and bring another bias
 
02:18:37.870 --> 02:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
similar to market for a whole year so
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%
you had onee Market
 
02:18:42.150 --> 02:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
exclusivity which would help cover the
 
02:18:43.990 --> 02:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
cost that it's really expensive to run
 
02:18:46.669 --> 02:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
these trials at the time too they didn't
 
02:18:50.509 --> 02:18:50.519 align:start position:0%
have the capabilities to analyze these
 
02:18:53.070 --> 02:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
um outside of humans and do the assays
 
02:18:56.070 --> 02:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure uh and make sure with
 
02:18:59.070 --> 02:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
enough confidence to satisfy the FDA
 
02:19:01.230 --> 02:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
that these really did act in the same
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
way so in the meantime there's been
 
02:19:05.830 --> 02:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
advances in the way that they can assay
 
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
these and assess them outside of humans
 
02:19:11.469 --> 02:19:11.479 align:start position:0%
um there's been movement um Senator Mike
 
02:19:13.709 --> 02:19:13.719 align:start position:0%
Lee has introduced legislation on this
 
02:19:15.870 --> 02:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
and there's been bipartisan support in
 
02:19:18.509 --> 02:19:18.519 align:start position:0%
order to do this um I want to note that
 
02:19:21.389 --> 02:19:21.399 align:start position:0%
um the only other legisl that I'm aware
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
of on biosimilars was when Senator
 
02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
Hassan actually put one in about more
 
02:19:27.950 --> 02:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
education to make sure that people are
 
02:19:30.349 --> 02:19:30.359 align:start position:0%
appropriately educated on biosimilars
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
and the options and the fact um and
 
02:19:35.230 --> 02:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
about their safety and about the
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
equivalency so the FDA has done several
 
02:19:40.870 --> 02:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
efforts to do this right now they're
 
02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
talking about the labels and the labels
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
they don't want to have a big
 
02:19:46.110 --> 02:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
distinction between an interchangeable
 
02:19:49.150 --> 02:19:49.160 align:start position:0%
label and a biosimilar label because
 
02:19:50.950 --> 02:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
that difference and designation is
 
02:19:53.429 --> 02:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
causing a lot of that hesitation and
 
02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's causing people to perceive that
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
they're having a different outcome just
 
02:19:59.710 --> 02:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
because they've gone from red to blue
 
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
they're working on some of the delivery
 
02:20:02.950 --> 02:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
mechanisms because some of these are
 
02:20:05.349 --> 02:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
shots and they're working to standardize
 
02:20:06.710 --> 02:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
this so there's a lot of different
 
02:20:09.630 --> 02:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
efforts within the FDA in order to move
 
02:20:12.349 --> 02:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
past this transition phase where we had
 
02:20:16.670 --> 02:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
interchangeable biologics um and move to
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
where the rest of the world is we a
 
02:20:21.630 --> 02:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
biosimilar is a biosimilar is a bio ilar
 
02:20:24.750 --> 02:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
uh the European uh medical agencies have
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
and the health leaders of Europe have
 
02:20:29.670 --> 02:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
also put out a paper trying to deal with
 
02:20:31.309 --> 02:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
the confusion around interchangeables
 
02:20:32.750 --> 02:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
and biosimilars because while
 
02:20:35.670 --> 02:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
interchangeables are a uniquely United
 
02:20:38.950 --> 02:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
us creation um the concern that's been
 
02:20:40.590 --> 02:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
raised about the difference between them
 
02:20:42.429 --> 02:20:42.439 align:start position:0%
has actually led to a lot of patient
 
02:20:46.630 --> 02:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
confusion even in Europe um so once the
 
02:20:49.550 --> 02:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
FDA is able to move past this and and
 
02:20:52.110 --> 02:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
move past this hurdle where they
 
02:20:54.190 --> 02:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
required more very very expensive tests
 
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
in order to get Market exclusivity that
 
02:20:57.670 --> 02:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
then also allows you to sell that one
 
02:21:00.110 --> 02:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
for more money than you would if if
 
02:21:01.469 --> 02:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
everybody and their brother was
 
02:21:04.309 --> 02:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
introducing a bio similar um this is
 
02:21:06.190 --> 02:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
going to really really reduce costs
 
02:21:09.270 --> 02:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
there's now over 60 uh biosimilars that
 
02:21:11.070 --> 02:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
have been approved in the US when this
 
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
bill was in front of Commerce last year
 
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
there were only 49 so this is something
 
02:21:17.710 --> 02:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely exploding and it's
 
02:21:20.389 --> 02:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
being done um it it's being done in a
 
02:21:20.399 --> 02:21:21.349 align:start position:0%
being done um it it's being done in a
way

02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:21:24.230 --> 02:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
that doesn't negatively impact Patients
 
02:21:26.790 --> 02:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
health so um according this is this is a
 
02:21:29.469 --> 02:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
little bit old it's from March 2020 but
 
02:21:32.030 --> 02:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
back then um biological products were
 
02:21:33.870 --> 02:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
only 2% of prescriptions but they
 
02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
accounted for 42% of the total net
 
02:21:38.510 --> 02:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
spending on prescription drugs in the US
 
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
which was up from 30% in
 
02:21:43.670 --> 02:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
2014 and um at the time one of the
 
02:21:45.870 --> 02:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
panelists was stating that about 40% of
 
02:21:48.469 --> 02:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
new drugs are biological products with
 
02:21:50.349 --> 02:21:50.359 align:start position:0%
60% being the small molecule what you
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
call a traditional drug so uh
 
02:21:55.790 --> 02:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
biologics really are advancing medicine
 
02:21:59.230 --> 02:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
for us these biosimilars are and um the
 
02:22:02.230 --> 02:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
FDA they don't have a time frame um when
 
02:22:04.070 --> 02:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
speaking with some of the industry
 
02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
lobbyists that have spoken with the
 
02:22:08.550 --> 02:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
lobbyists in DC the FDA doesn't have to
 
02:22:10.230 --> 02:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
act on the draft guidance at any point
 
02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
in time um I had thought that if this
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
was going to come in the summer then
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
maybe we hold on to it and wait and do
 
02:22:17.550 --> 02:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
it after that but we don't know when the
 
02:22:20.030 --> 02:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
FDA will act but if we pass this we're
 
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
ready and or poised and able to take
 
02:22:25.309 --> 02:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
advantage of that change without moving
 
02:22:27.990 --> 02:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
ahead of them follow
 
02:22:30.270 --> 02:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
up just a quick follow because I'm
 
02:22:32.670 --> 02:22:32.680 align:start position:0%
really trying to understand so it sounds
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
like that they have uh they're loosening
 
02:22:39.230 --> 02:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
up on uh the testing methodologies that
 
02:22:41.870 --> 02:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
would allow you to to no he's shaking
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
his head um but um so I'm just trying to
 
02:22:48.030 --> 02:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
understand so but they're allowing for
 
02:22:51.389 --> 02:22:51.399 align:start position:0%
um more streamlined testing
 
02:22:54.550 --> 02:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
and um also they're eliminating
 
02:22:56.950 --> 02:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
basically you're the first guy you have
 
02:22:59.750 --> 02:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
kind of the Monopoly on it but it sounds
 
02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
like from what you're saying if I
 
02:23:02.190 --> 02:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
understand correctly they're still
 
02:23:05.349 --> 02:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
licensing though right and so if they're
 
02:23:07.990 --> 02:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
still licensing if I read the language
 
02:23:10.270 --> 02:23:10.280 align:start position:0%
in here you're just taking out being
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
licensed by the FDA as an
 
02:23:14.110 --> 02:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
interchangeable biological product so
 
02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
but they're still doing the licensing
 
02:23:18.070 --> 02:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's just that they're altering certain
 
02:23:21.190 --> 02:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
methodologies and certain prohibition
 
02:23:24.110 --> 02:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
so I don't understand what this change
 
02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
of language is doing really and it's
 
02:23:29.469 --> 02:23:29.479 align:start position:0%
probably just I'm just not putting the
 
02:23:32.469 --> 02:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
pieces of a puzzle together yet thank
 
02:23:34.630 --> 02:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
you for that question it's um because
 
02:23:36.750 --> 02:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
they took that intermediate step of of
 
02:23:38.990 --> 02:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
these interchangeable we don't know
 
02:23:40.750 --> 02:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
exactly how they're going to change the
 
02:23:42.590 --> 02:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
language for the interchangeable so
 
02:23:44.590 --> 02:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
that's why it's written a way that it is
 
02:23:45.910 --> 02:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
so that when they determine that
 
02:23:47.469 --> 02:23:47.479 align:start position:0%
something is equivalent to an
 
02:23:50.030 --> 02:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
interchangeable um this sort of mushy
 
02:23:52.269 --> 02:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
language would allow us to recognize
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
that the FDA has recognized this as
 
02:23:55.990 --> 02:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
interchange as essentially the same as
 
02:23:58.910 --> 02:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
interchangeable therefore stay law will
 
02:24:01.590 --> 02:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
as well thank you you're welcome other
 
02:24:04.590 --> 02:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative Woods thank you
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:24:08.670 --> 02:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
question um drilling down a little bit
 
02:24:09.950 --> 02:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
you may not be able to answer the
 
02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
question but what are what are the
 
02:24:15.790 --> 02:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
details about the loosening of the uh
 
02:24:18.790 --> 02:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
I'll use that term props in properly uh
 
02:24:21.710 --> 02:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
the change in test thing that's uh
 
02:24:24.349 --> 02:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
different with the biologic versus a a
 
02:24:27.630 --> 02:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
new drug that comes out which has really
 
02:24:30.150 --> 02:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
internationally one of the more rigorous
 
02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
testing programs and that's to our
 
02:24:36.070 --> 02:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
detriment in general what is that
 
02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
difference uh harking back into the
 
02:24:41.870 --> 02:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
history with Penicillin uh when we found
 
02:24:43.710 --> 02:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
out that we people were really allergic
 
02:24:46.429 --> 02:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
to it but it wasn't penicillin it was
 
02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
the Moy it it was vehicle carry in the
 
02:24:53.269 --> 02:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
penicillin that was the problem so
 
02:24:55.830 --> 02:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
there's subtle changes that can be
 
02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
dramatically even though so what what is
 
02:25:01.230 --> 02:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
the difference in the testing that uh
 
02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
and U you may not know the details but
 
02:25:07.150 --> 02:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
uh I have some concern so I can hit the
 
02:25:08.830 --> 02:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
surface on this my husband's actually
 
02:25:11.070 --> 02:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
been involved in biomedical research for
 
02:25:13.910 --> 02:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
over 30 years and he is intimately
 
02:25:15.750 --> 02:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
involved in that process for bringing
 
02:25:18.030 --> 02:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
biologics and biosimilars to Market so
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
he'll be able to give you more details
 
02:25:22.590 --> 02:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
than I um he's he's here um I know that
 
02:25:24.630 --> 02:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
there's also companies that have been
 
02:25:26.510 --> 02:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
Pioneers in this area who are here as
 
02:25:27.750 --> 02:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
well so there's going to be a lot of
 
02:25:30.110 --> 02:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
good scientific knowledge
 
02:25:32.670 --> 02:25:32.680 align:start position:0%
um but what they're removing was the is
 
02:25:35.349 --> 02:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
the in-person switching studies because
 
02:25:37.230 --> 02:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
now they have more and when they're
 
02:25:39.670 --> 02:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
assessing these um you know you're not
 
02:25:41.230 --> 02:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
just you're not just looking at a little
 
02:25:43.030 --> 02:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
stick that says yes it's the same no
 
02:25:45.230 --> 02:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
it's not it's a lot more highly involved
 
02:25:47.309 --> 02:25:47.319 align:start position:0%
than that um but other people can speak
 
02:25:51.269 --> 02:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
to that more and and worldwide have not
 
02:25:54.630 --> 02:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
been unique Adverse Events from a bio
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
similar that is different than the
 
02:25:59.670 --> 02:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events from the reference
 
02:26:01.950 --> 02:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
molecule so there's risks but they're
 
02:26:04.910 --> 02:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
the same risks as the original
 
02:26:07.630 --> 02:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
one other
 
02:26:10.030 --> 02:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
questions saying no other questions
 
02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:17.870 --> 02:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
02:26:39.150 --> 02:26:39.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:40.790 --> 02:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
the committee uh my name is Chris Ken I
 
02:26:45.110 --> 02:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
work as part of uh amen state government
 
02:26:47.590 --> 02:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
Affairs uh covering New England uh a
 
02:26:49.630 --> 02:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
little bit of background about uh Amgen
 
02:26:52.750 --> 02:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
the company that I work for um we are a
 
02:26:54.830 --> 02:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
biotechnology company backed by four
 
02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
Decades of experience with the research
 
02:26:58.429 --> 02:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
development in manufacturing of
 
02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
Innovator and biosimilar
 
02:27:04.510 --> 02:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
drugs uh we currently have 11 biosimilar
 
02:27:07.150 --> 02:27:07.160 align:start position:0%
uh uh products in our portfolio half of
 
02:27:08.670 --> 02:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
them are marketed and then the other
 
02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
half are in development
 
02:27:12.950 --> 02:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
currently uh and we have substantial
 
02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
ongoing investments in biosimilar
 
02:27:17.469 --> 02:27:17.479 align:start position:0%
research and development um I just kind
 
02:27:19.870 --> 02:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
of wanted to talk about um this bill so
 
02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
last year uh in the uh house Commerce
 
02:27:24.510 --> 02:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
and consumer affairs committee I sat up
 
02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
here and opposed the legislation and
 
02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
currently we still we still oppose the
 
02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
legislation um for a number of reasons
 
02:27:33.630 --> 02:27:33.640 align:start position:0%
and it really has to do with patient
 
02:27:36.950 --> 02:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
safety and uh dosing um that's what it
 
02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
comes down to in the end if you if you
 
02:27:42.269 --> 02:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
kind of boil everything down um I I'm
 
02:27:44.750 --> 02:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'm the way that I originally read this
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh the intent was to follow on the bill
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
last year but it's sounding like um that
 
02:27:54.670 --> 02:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
this bill uh the intent of it is to uh
 
02:27:57.269 --> 02:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
have a law in place or a statute in
 
02:28:00.070 --> 02:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
place um that would follow any type of
 
02:28:02.510 --> 02:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
actions at the federal level or if FDA
 
02:28:04.349 --> 02:28:04.359 align:start position:0%
takes it
 
02:28:06.670 --> 02:28:06.680 align:start position:0%
um I really don't think at this point
 
02:28:09.230 --> 02:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
the bill is needed uh for a number of
 
02:28:13.230 --> 02:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
reasons um you know first and foremost I
 
02:28:14.910 --> 02:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
we believe that the interchangeable
 
02:28:17.550 --> 02:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
designation is an important one um and
 
02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
just as a a quick and I'm going to try
 
02:28:22.389 --> 02:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
to keep this as brief as possible um but
 
02:28:23.830 --> 02:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
back in June of
 
02:28:26.550 --> 02:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
2018 um there was a law that passed in
 
02:28:29.469 --> 02:28:29.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in all 50 states you know
 
02:28:31.030 --> 02:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's called the pharmacy
 
02:28:33.990 --> 02:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
substitution um act and and and the
 
02:28:36.590 --> 02:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
current law as passed in June of 18 in
 
02:28:38.230 --> 02:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and all other all the
 
02:28:40.710 --> 02:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
other 50 states have it um it permits a
 
02:28:42.030 --> 02:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
pharmacist to dispense an
 
02:28:44.950 --> 02:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
interchangeable biosimilar product only
 
02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
when the brand reference product has
 
02:28:49.429 --> 02:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
been prescribed um once a substitution
 
02:28:51.269 --> 02:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
has been made a pharmacist has 3 days to
 
02:28:53.830 --> 02:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
communicate back to the physician that a
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
substitution was made in our view um
 
02:28:59.510 --> 02:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
this law is working very well and we
 
02:29:01.510 --> 02:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
don't see a need at this time to make
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
any changes to the law uh including
 
02:29:05.790 --> 02:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation which you know
 
02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
in the end I'm not sure the way that we
 
02:29:09.510 --> 02:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
read it I don't think it really does too
 
02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
much to be honest um but what this
 
02:29:14.910 --> 02:29:14.920 align:start position:0%
legislation you know again as the way
 
02:29:16.469 --> 02:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
that we look at it it would allow a
 
02:29:18.710 --> 02:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacist to substitute one designated
 
02:29:20.469 --> 02:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
interchangeable for another designated
 
02:29:23.070 --> 02:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
interchangeable but uh I'm learning that
 
02:29:25.150 --> 02:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
that maybe that you know my reading of
 
02:29:27.510 --> 02:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
the bill might be incorrect um but again
 
02:29:29.269 --> 02:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
we we think that the current law is
 
02:29:30.870 --> 02:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
working well and then there were a
 
02:29:33.150 --> 02:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
couple of questions I wanted to int also
 
02:29:36.550 --> 02:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
talk about um you know when uh
 
02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I think you had
 
02:29:42.870 --> 02:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
asked about um a patient declining uh a
 
02:29:45.150 --> 02:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh substitution so if you think about it
 
02:29:46.429 --> 02:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of these folks that are taking
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
these biologic medicines are really sick
 
02:29:51.510 --> 02:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
grievously ill chronically ill folks
 
02:29:53.670 --> 02:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
that might be in not not might be in the
 
02:29:56.230 --> 02:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
right mindset um to make a decision
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
about if a pharmacist is asking them uh
 
02:30:02.150 --> 02:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
about a substitution also um a lot of
 
02:30:04.349 --> 02:30:04.359 align:start position:0%
times family members or caregivers will
 
02:30:05.870 --> 02:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
be there to pick up the prescription as
 
02:30:07.790 --> 02:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
well and they might not necessarily know
 
02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
to say something um you know if if we
 
02:30:12.710 --> 02:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
were to pass something like this in New
 
02:30:14.429 --> 02:30:14.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it would make New Hampshire a
 
02:30:17.150 --> 02:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
complete outlier this bill has not been
 
02:30:18.750 --> 02:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
introduced anywhere in the entire
 
02:30:22.349 --> 02:30:22.359 align:start position:0%
country um I don't know of any any other
 
02:30:25.670 --> 02:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh State that's considering this um and
 
02:30:27.469 --> 02:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
again this this would make New Hampshire
 
02:30:31.910 --> 02:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
a complete outlier in in doing this
 
02:30:34.110 --> 02:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
um another thing that I just kind of
 
02:30:39.150 --> 02:30:39.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk about is is if um uh was
 
02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
the refuse to yeah um but yeah I mean
 
02:30:44.750 --> 02:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's there's the timer I knew
 
02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
my time was coming up but um you know we
 
02:30:48.309 --> 02:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
oppose this I don't think that this is
 
02:30:50.590 --> 02:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh needed to be passed at
 
02:30:52.590 --> 02:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
this time and I'm happy to take any
 
02:30:56.870 --> 02:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:01.110 --> 02:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
questions wow you covered it
 
02:31:03.630 --> 02:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
well thank you I don't see any questions
 
02:31:09.550 --> 02:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Jason AIS
 
02:31:14.510 --> 02:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire insurance
 
02:31:14.520 --> 02:31:20.030 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire insurance
department

02:31:20.030 --> 02:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:21.950 --> 02:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair uh for the record
 
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
my name is Jason AIS director of Health
 
02:31:25.030 --> 02:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
Economics New Hampshire insurance
 
02:31:26.990 --> 02:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
department I also sit on New Hampshire's
 
02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
last year the insurance department spoke
 
02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
on behalf of uh representative Merchants
 
02:31:37.349 --> 02:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
Bill yes so last year we supported the
 
02:31:39.110 --> 02:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill when representative
 
02:31:41.030 --> 02:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
Merchants sponsored it and this year the
 
02:31:43.110 --> 02:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
insurance department is also in support
 
02:31:43.950 --> 02:31:43.960 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:31:47.230 --> 02:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
bill um I think one thing that
 
02:31:48.710 --> 02:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner beton Court feels
 
02:31:50.550 --> 02:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
importantly about is competition ition
 
02:31:53.190 --> 02:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
and um providing our citizens with lower
 
02:31:55.269 --> 02:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
cost alternatives to expensive branded
 
02:31:57.030 --> 02:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
biologic drugs and we feel that this
 
02:31:59.150 --> 02:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
bill is a step I'll be an incremental
 
02:32:01.710 --> 02:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
step um in that direction so we are in
 
02:32:04.230 --> 02:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and we'll keep my
 
02:32:06.030 --> 02:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
testimony short so if anybody has any
 
02:32:08.389 --> 02:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
questions happy to answer them thank you
 
02:32:10.510 --> 02:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
02:32:13.309 --> 02:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no question oh I'm rep
 
02:32:16.190 --> 02:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:19.070 --> 02:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
palaza thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:32:20.670 --> 02:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:32:24.030 --> 02:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
so from insurance department point of
 
02:32:27.950 --> 02:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
view like if things if things go
 
02:32:29.990 --> 02:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
sideways side
 
02:32:34.630 --> 02:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
sideways if there are some problems with
 
02:32:37.349 --> 02:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh um some
 
02:32:40.309 --> 02:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and some
 
02:32:43.870 --> 02:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
concentrations as we heard and if there
 
02:32:45.389 --> 02:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
will be
 
02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
some uh I don't know side effects or um
 
02:32:55.190 --> 02:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh damage to patients uh how would it
 
02:32:58.389 --> 02:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
play with your department will you see
 
02:32:58.399 --> 02:33:00.349 align:start position:0%
play with your department will you see
some

02:33:00.349 --> 02:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:33:03.910 --> 02:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
effects if you could speak to it yeah so
 
02:33:06.190 --> 02:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
adverse drug events I think is common
 
02:33:08.230 --> 02:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
vernacular for side
 
02:33:11.190 --> 02:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
effects that that's a good question it's
 
02:33:15.389 --> 02:33:15.399 align:start position:0%
complex I think our Central concern is
 
02:33:18.110 --> 02:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
the financing of expensive but important
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
pharmacological Therapies
 
02:33:23.830 --> 02:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
and we we noted in the 2023 New
 
02:33:27.510 --> 02:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire pdab annual report that um
 
02:33:30.269 --> 02:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
when you have a a branded biologic
 
02:33:33.150 --> 02:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
Market that has no competition that
 
02:33:37.190 --> 02:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
prices are about 230% higher compared to
 
02:33:40.349 --> 02:33:40.359 align:start position:0%
biologic markets for which biosimilars
 
02:33:42.429 --> 02:33:42.439 align:start position:0%
have been introduced so there's a we we
 
02:33:44.429 --> 02:33:44.439 align:start position:0%
noticed an erosion of the Branded
 
02:33:47.630 --> 02:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
biologic markets once the bio similars
 
02:33:50.750 --> 02:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
entered we use the the examp Le was
 
02:33:52.349 --> 02:33:52.359 align:start position:0%
Remicade in
 
02:33:55.510 --> 02:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
fmab and all three of the bio similars
 
02:33:58.349 --> 02:33:58.359 align:start position:0%
for Remicade were also in fmab they were
 
02:34:00.830 --> 02:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
just different isomerized versions of
 
02:34:03.469 --> 02:34:03.479 align:start position:0%
them if that's the right term so as far
 
02:34:06.429 --> 02:34:06.439 align:start position:0%
as adverse drug events I think it's very
 
02:34:08.230 --> 02:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
different compared to the small molecule
 
02:34:10.269 --> 02:34:10.279 align:start position:0%
and generic
 
02:34:12.870 --> 02:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
Paradigm uh versus the biologic and
 
02:34:15.110 --> 02:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
biosimilar they're essentially the same
 
02:34:17.950 --> 02:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
substances just different um ISO forms
 
02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
of them so that's the the limits of my
 
02:34:24.309 --> 02:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
knowledge on that but cost is a big um
 
02:34:26.429 --> 02:34:26.439 align:start position:0%
cost exerts great harm to people so if
 
02:34:28.630 --> 02:34:28.640 align:start position:0%
they paying two to three times as much
 
02:34:31.870 --> 02:34:31.880 align:start position:0%
for the same therapies by definition and
 
02:34:33.429 --> 02:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
by the construct of the you know the
 
02:34:37.389 --> 02:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
social ecological model that that also
 
02:34:40.230 --> 02:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
is an adverse effect on on people's
 
02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
well-being and that's the lens that we
 
02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
have in the insurance department who
 
02:34:46.230 --> 02:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
Insurance finances healthc care delivery
 
02:34:48.150 --> 02:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
to our society and so that's an
 
02:34:51.030 --> 02:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
important Central theme of our interest
 
02:34:53.269 --> 02:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
in this Bill thank you for the question
 
02:34:54.230 --> 02:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
repres sentive
 
02:34:56.190 --> 02:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:34:58.550 --> 02:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um we went
 
02:35:01.150 --> 02:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
through some of the language of lure FDA
 
02:35:04.950 --> 02:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
not FDA but um the the gentleman from
 
02:35:07.870 --> 02:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
amen when he testified he said and I'm
 
02:35:09.750 --> 02:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to recall everything drinking
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
a lot that um in
 
02:35:16.230 --> 02:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
2018 the rules um were that pharmacists
 
02:35:18.309 --> 02:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
you know if the doctor wrote a script
 
02:35:20.269 --> 02:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
could prescribe
 
02:35:21.950 --> 02:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
an alternative or they could on their
 
02:35:23.990 --> 02:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
own but they had to notifi notify the
 
02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
position within 3 days so I I'm just
 
02:35:30.429 --> 02:35:30.439 align:start position:0%
looking at changes I don't see anything
 
02:35:33.150 --> 02:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
of that in the italicized portion of
 
02:35:36.870 --> 02:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
this bill so can you speak about the
 
02:35:40.389 --> 02:35:40.399 align:start position:0%
role of the pharmacist with this bill
 
02:35:45.309 --> 02:35:45.319 align:start position:0%
the how does this bill deviate from the
 
02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
2018 law with respect to the role of the
 
02:35:51.190 --> 02:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
pharmacist it was my understanding from
 
02:35:53.429 --> 02:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant that this gives
 
02:35:55.110 --> 02:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist a little bit more
 
02:35:57.830 --> 02:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility if the interchangeability
 
02:36:00.429 --> 02:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
status was was augmented or the barrier
 
02:36:02.750 --> 02:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
for interchangeability status was
 
02:36:04.990 --> 02:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
reduced then at the point of sale the
 
02:36:07.190 --> 02:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
pharmacist would have more flexibility
 
02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
changing that out for the patient and
 
02:36:12.269 --> 02:36:12.279 align:start position:0%
that's the limit of my knowledge on that
 
02:36:13.910 --> 02:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
right so maybe I'll save some followup
 
02:36:15.710 --> 02:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
for the next speaker then thank you very
 
02:36:17.950 --> 02:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
much thank you for your question other
 
02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:21.269 align:start position:0%
much thank you for your question other
questions

02:36:21.269 --> 02:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:26.630 --> 02:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:29.510 --> 02:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
much also signed up to speak is Dr
 
02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:35.750 align:start position:0%
much also signed up to speak is Dr
Michael

02:36:35.750 --> 02:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:38.550 --> 02:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
Lon good morning members of the
 
02:36:40.030 --> 02:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
committee thank you kindly for uh
 
02:36:41.630 --> 02:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify this morning my
 
02:36:44.469 --> 02:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
name is Michael Aon um yes it's Dr Leon
 
02:36:46.429 --> 02:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
Michael's also uh seven letters I prefer
 
02:36:49.110 --> 02:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
Michael but uh that be that as it may um
 
02:36:50.950 --> 02:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
my train as a pharmacologist right here
 
02:36:52.670 --> 02:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um proud to say I did
 
02:36:55.990 --> 02:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
my training at Dartmouth um I've been
 
02:36:57.750 --> 02:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
doing biomedical research since the late
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
80s not quite 40 years but it's getting
 
02:37:03.950 --> 02:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
Mighty close um I'm hoping in just a few
 
02:37:06.150 --> 02:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
minutes to be able to communicate a few
 
02:37:08.230 --> 02:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
things to this committee a what is a
 
02:37:10.750 --> 02:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
biologic as I know last year the
 
02:37:12.230 --> 02:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee deserves a lot of
 
02:37:13.990 --> 02:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
thanks especially chairman hunt to uh
 
02:37:15.550 --> 02:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
actually change this position after
 
02:37:17.950 --> 02:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the data biologics aren't
 
02:37:19.910 --> 02:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
that complicated um if if you want to
 
02:37:23.110 --> 02:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
dig into them um I'd be happy to provide
 
02:37:24.630 --> 02:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
anyone on this committee a link there's
 
02:37:27.269 --> 02:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
a two text book they're about this thick
 
02:37:27.279 --> 02:37:28.190 align:start position:0%
a two text book they're about this thick
on

02:37:28.190 --> 02:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:37:30.590 --> 02:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
biosimilars um you must like a lot of
 
02:37:32.070 --> 02:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
coffee if you're going to get two those
 
02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
it's they're they're dense biologics
 
02:37:36.309 --> 02:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
themselves are quite easy they've been
 
02:37:39.230 --> 02:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
around a long time um in fact amen who I
 
02:37:41.469 --> 02:37:41.479 align:start position:0%
used to work for for 13 years one of
 
02:37:44.550 --> 02:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
their products called nen or Phil gastr
 
02:37:46.429 --> 02:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
causes the body to make more white blood
 
02:37:48.150 --> 02:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
cells the specific type of white blood
 
02:37:50.510 --> 02:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
cell I belong to the American Society of
 
02:37:52.190 --> 02:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
clinical oncology which called this one
 
02:37:54.150 --> 02:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
of the biggest breakthroughs of the last
 
02:37:57.110 --> 02:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
century this biologic basically
 
02:37:59.269 --> 02:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
transformed the lives of cancer patients
 
02:38:01.870 --> 02:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
from having to be hospitalized when the
 
02:38:04.190 --> 02:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
majority of chemotherapies would
 
02:38:06.469 --> 02:38:06.479 align:start position:0%
suppress a patient's immune system to
 
02:38:08.190 --> 02:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
the point if you get an infection which
 
02:38:10.070 --> 02:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
manifest as a fever it's called f
 
02:38:12.670 --> 02:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
neutropenia it becomes medical
 
02:38:15.790 --> 02:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
emergency a simple injection in the arm
 
02:38:17.550 --> 02:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
I hate needles but simple injection in
 
02:38:20.030 --> 02:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
the arm can be given elsewhere
 
02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
would help patients produce more of
 
02:38:24.230 --> 02:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
these nutrifil potentially preventing
 
02:38:27.070 --> 02:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
infections this was overwhelming um
 
02:38:29.030 --> 02:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
successful for patients that they were
 
02:38:30.670 --> 02:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
able to receive their CH chemotherapy
 
02:38:32.030 --> 02:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
and go home and be with their
 
02:38:34.230 --> 02:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
family more drugs came along they were
 
02:38:35.550 --> 02:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
small molecules that got rid of
 
02:38:37.630 --> 02:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy the nausey and vomiting but
 
02:38:40.269 --> 02:38:40.279 align:start position:0%
uh needless to say biologics within the
 
02:38:43.510 --> 02:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:45.469 --> 02:38:45.479 align:start position:0%
transformative it is not their biggest
 
02:38:47.710 --> 02:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
use if you know anyone who has something
 
02:38:50.910 --> 02:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
like Ms Crohn's disease disease uh
 
02:38:52.790 --> 02:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
psoriasis either of the forms of
 
02:38:55.110 --> 02:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
psoriasis um you may know someone else
 
02:38:57.670 --> 02:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
was something a nonh or non malignant
 
02:39:00.870 --> 02:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
hemat hematology uh condition called
 
02:39:03.630 --> 02:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
immune I'll just call it ITP um people
 
02:39:04.910 --> 02:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
produce antibodies against their own
 
02:39:07.790 --> 02:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
platelets there are biologics that treat
 
02:39:10.710 --> 02:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
these every drug has side effects though
 
02:39:12.429 --> 02:39:12.439 align:start position:0%
one of the first biologics I grew up in
 
02:39:13.990 --> 02:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
San Diego place called the scripts
 
02:39:15.630 --> 02:39:15.640 align:start position:0%
Research Institute it's owned by MD
 
02:39:18.429 --> 02:39:18.439 align:start position:0%
Anderson out of Texas now was developing
 
02:39:21.030 --> 02:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
an antibody we to make them in
 
02:39:24.910 --> 02:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
mice patient with cancer was given a an
 
02:39:28.590 --> 02:39:28.600 align:start position:0%
antibody from mice absolutely amazing
 
02:39:30.550 --> 02:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
results on the first infusion
 
02:39:32.590 --> 02:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the second infusion that
 
02:39:35.190 --> 02:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
patient died because while the antibody
 
02:39:37.870 --> 02:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
had worked it had gone in and attacked
 
02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
cancer cells that patient's body I will
 
02:39:43.750 --> 02:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
wrap up the patient's body saw the
 
02:39:45.349 --> 02:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
antibody as a foreign entity and
 
02:39:47.670 --> 02:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
developed antibodies against it this is
 
02:39:49.790 --> 02:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
where interchange the the previous
 
02:39:51.550 --> 02:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
concern about interchangeability
 
02:39:53.309 --> 02:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
originated from in the
 
02:39:56.630 --> 02:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
US that was a purely mine uh Mouse
 
02:39:59.269 --> 02:39:59.279 align:start position:0%
antibody antibodies now are engineered
 
02:40:01.269 --> 02:40:01.279 align:start position:0%
that they're fully human you can take an
 
02:40:02.990 --> 02:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
antibody and put it into any person in
 
02:40:04.590 --> 02:40:04.600 align:start position:0%
this room I hope none of you need them
 
02:40:06.590 --> 02:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
but if you do you can rest assure they
 
02:40:09.030 --> 02:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
are now made fully the vast majority are
 
02:40:10.950 --> 02:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
fully human that your body wouldn't
 
02:40:13.630 --> 02:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
recognize them our immune systems are
 
02:40:17.070 --> 02:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
complex biologics are not in a nutshell
 
02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
aspirin small or small molecules are
 
02:40:21.630 --> 02:40:21.640 align:start position:0%
made in a test tube if you will they're
 
02:40:24.110 --> 02:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
they're made by chemicals they are exact
 
02:40:25.550 --> 02:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
copies of
 
02:40:28.630 --> 02:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
of the reference product the copies are
 
02:40:30.510 --> 02:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
exact copies
 
02:40:32.790 --> 02:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
biosimilars biologic drugs are made in a
 
02:40:35.070 --> 02:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
living system they're made in cells now
 
02:40:36.349 --> 02:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
if any of you have ever been to a
 
02:40:38.990 --> 02:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
brewery or grow hydroponics in big Vats
 
02:40:41.070 --> 02:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
that's exactly how cells are grown now
 
02:40:43.590 --> 02:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
um I happy to chat offline anytime about
 
02:40:46.110 --> 02:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
it I'm a scientist I get excited about
 
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
this however even a single comp's
 
02:40:51.510 --> 02:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
product from today think of a baker if
 
02:40:52.910 --> 02:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
you bake cookies today and you bake
 
02:40:54.510 --> 02:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
cookies tomorrow same recipe they're
 
02:40:57.030 --> 02:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
going to be slightly different in order
 
02:41:00.429 --> 02:41:00.439 align:start position:0%
for a biologic to be approved the FDA
 
02:41:02.269 --> 02:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
the company manufacturing it and in the
 
02:41:05.030 --> 02:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
case of biosimilar the competitors do
 
02:41:06.750 --> 02:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
pre-clinical testing so they look at it
 
02:41:08.990 --> 02:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
on a lab bench if you will start
 
02:41:10.630 --> 02:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
wrapping up please okay yep there there
 
02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
are at that point differences you look
 
02:41:15.269 --> 02:41:15.279 align:start position:0%
at animal testing there are not
 
02:41:16.790 --> 02:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
differences there they can be detected
 
02:41:18.750 --> 02:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be considered biosimilar
 
02:41:20.510 --> 02:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
and then the standard is clinical
 
02:41:24.349 --> 02:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
testing in clinical testing there cannot
 
02:41:27.150 --> 02:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
be any distinguishing there they
 
02:41:28.950 --> 02:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
indistinguishable whether you have a bio
 
02:41:31.070 --> 02:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
similar or the original biologic and by
 
02:41:33.349 --> 02:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
indistinguishable I mean both safety and
 
02:41:36.830 --> 02:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
efficacy if you can't distinguish them
 
02:41:38.429 --> 02:41:38.439 align:start position:0%
having something that's interchangeable
 
02:41:40.510 --> 02:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
doing more testing they can't be more
 
02:41:41.950 --> 02:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
indistinguishable if you can't
 
02:41:44.070 --> 02:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
distinguish them in the first place okay
 
02:41:46.750 --> 02:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so thank you thank you any
 
02:41:50.670 --> 02:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative mlan
 
02:41:51.750 --> 02:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr jar and thank you for
 
02:41:53.830 --> 02:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question so again you know I'm
 
02:41:55.550 --> 02:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
just looking some of the stuff is
 
02:41:58.150 --> 02:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
italicized but some of the stuff around
 
02:42:00.070 --> 02:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
the role of the pharmacists it that
 
02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear like it all is so I just
 
02:42:06.590 --> 02:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
if you're aware I I want to understand
 
02:42:09.429 --> 02:42:09.439 align:start position:0%
the role of the pharmacist and how it
 
02:42:11.950 --> 02:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
changes if this bill
 
02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
passes absolutely so I think in a in a
 
02:42:16.670 --> 02:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
nutshell that bill that you're looking
 
02:42:20.269 --> 02:42:20.279 align:start position:0%
at a biosimilar also has to have the
 
02:42:22.590 --> 02:42:22.600 align:start position:0%
additional designation which exists only
 
02:42:24.510 --> 02:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
in the US nowhere else in the world of
 
02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:25.750 align:start position:0%
in the US nowhere else in the world of
being

02:42:25.750 --> 02:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:42:27.590 --> 02:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
interchangeable it would remove that
 
02:42:30.190 --> 02:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
interchangeable and allow a biosimilar
 
02:42:32.590 --> 02:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
that's not considered interchangeable
 
02:42:33.469 --> 02:42:33.479 align:start position:0%
it's still
 
02:42:35.870 --> 02:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
indistinguishable then for a pharmacist
 
02:42:38.110 --> 02:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
to substitute it but if I can clear for
 
02:42:40.269 --> 02:42:40.279 align:start position:0%
a pharmacist um I used to work with
 
02:42:41.910 --> 02:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant clinically we
 
02:42:44.550 --> 02:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
never chatted politics pharmacists are
 
02:42:46.510 --> 02:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
underappreciated heroes in our health
 
02:42:48.590 --> 02:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
care System they not only help with
 
02:42:50.309 --> 02:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
prescriptions of drugs I was actually
 
02:42:52.030 --> 02:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
safe from a prescription of penicillin
 
02:42:53.429 --> 02:42:53.439 align:start position:0%
I'm deadly allergic to it by a
 
02:42:55.510 --> 02:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacist they also have to balance
 
02:42:57.870 --> 02:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
books and if you're pick your favorite
 
02:43:00.150 --> 02:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
hospital or least favorite if you want
 
02:43:02.309 --> 02:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
when they choose to have a particular
 
02:43:04.110 --> 02:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
drug on what they call formulary it's
 
02:43:05.389 --> 02:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
their their list of drugs that they're
 
02:43:06.630 --> 02:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
going to keep they may have the
 
02:43:08.630 --> 02:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
originator molecule they're only
 
02:43:10.590 --> 02:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
probably going to pick one biosimilar
 
02:43:12.389 --> 02:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
they're not likely to pick multiple
 
02:43:14.429 --> 02:43:14.439 align:start position:0%
biosimilars so if someone comes up here
 
02:43:16.110 --> 02:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
from Florida we're just about to hit
 
02:43:18.630 --> 02:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
Spring or vice versa someone moves they
 
02:43:20.910 --> 02:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
move a he healthare system they just
 
02:43:23.670 --> 02:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
change pharmacies whatever it might be
 
02:43:25.830 --> 02:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
they may be offered a different
 
02:43:27.870 --> 02:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
biosimilar and right now this would
 
02:43:29.910 --> 02:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
allow someone to switch from one bioer
 
02:43:31.870 --> 02:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
to the other without having to invoke
 
02:43:35.870 --> 02:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
the originator molecule nor um an
 
02:43:38.710 --> 02:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
interchangeable follow up yes thank you
 
02:43:43.429 --> 02:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
now um so so I got that part but if if
 
02:43:47.710 --> 02:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
this was to pass this bill um as I'm
 
02:43:52.510 --> 02:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
trying to read it does does that even if
 
02:43:55.790 --> 02:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
the FDA doesn't change its rules okay
 
02:43:59.230 --> 02:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
which we've were talking about does that
 
02:44:01.429 --> 02:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
does the pharmacist still have that kind
 
02:44:03.429 --> 02:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
of latitude in this bill or no it is
 
02:44:06.070 --> 02:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
contingent on the FDA rule change I
 
02:44:07.870 --> 02:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
believe in my reading it is contingent
 
02:44:09.950 --> 02:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
upon the FDA rule change be right now
 
02:44:11.990 --> 02:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
they are restricted to interchangeables
 
02:44:13.990 --> 02:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
only which is an additional designation
 
02:44:15.670 --> 02:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
that exists only in the US thank you
 
02:44:20.469 --> 02:44:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:24.910 --> 02:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:27.070 --> 02:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
kindly no one else has signed up to
 
02:44:28.830 --> 02:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill does anyone else wish
 
02:44:32.110 --> 02:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
to speak on
 
02:44:34.389 --> 02:44:34.399 align:start position:0%
hb17 if not I'm going to close this
 
02:44:36.710 --> 02:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
public hearing next public hearing is
 
02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 1 pm on HCR 7 we're in
 
02:45:17.950 --> 02:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:47.910 align:start position:0%

members I'm proud to introduce HCR 7
 
03:38:07.790 --> 03:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
today which is a simple and

straightforward resolution that allows

our constituents to clearly see where
 
03:38:13.990 --> 03:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire house stands on the
 
03:38:16.349 --> 03:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
right to abortion before four weeks of
 
03:38:18.590 --> 03:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
pregnancy I've heard from so many of my
 
03:38:20.349 --> 03:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
constituents that they do not want any
 
03:38:22.309 --> 03:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
further restrictions on abortion in New
 
03:38:23.990 --> 03:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I know many of my
 
03:38:26.429 --> 03:38:26.439 align:start position:0%
colleagues have heard the same as well
 
03:38:28.309 --> 03:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
we know that a super majority of granite
 
03:38:30.750 --> 03:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
Staters want their lawmakers to take
 
03:38:33.070 --> 03:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
proactive action on abortion rights in
 
03:38:35.670 --> 03:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire New Hampshire is the only
 
03:38:37.189 --> 03:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
state in New England that doesn't have
 
03:38:39.070 --> 03:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
the right to abortion clearly spelled
 
03:38:42.189 --> 03:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
out in their state law or our state
 
03:38:44.429 --> 03:38:44.439 align:start position:0%
constitution this lack of clarity is
 
03:38:47.189 --> 03:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
confusing for voters and it's our job as
 
03:38:51.070 --> 03:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
lawmakers to be clear what HCR 7 does is
 
03:38:53.070 --> 03:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
clearly show our constituents that our
 
03:38:55.830 --> 03:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
house position on abortion that an
 
03:38:58.150 --> 03:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
individual's ability to access abortion

be denied or infringed upon by the
 
03:39:05.790 --> 03:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
government we saw how important abortion
 
03:39:08.469 --> 03:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
was in the 2024 election legislators
 
03:39:10.510 --> 03:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
lawmakers so many of us running for
 
03:39:12.950 --> 03:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
office promised on the campaign Trail to
 
03:39:15.389 --> 03:39:15.399 align:start position:0%
not further restrict abortion in New
 
03:39:17.429 --> 03:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now it's time to put our words
 
03:39:20.189 --> 03:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
into action New Hampshire for so long
 
03:39:22.229 --> 03:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
has had a long proud bipartisan
 
03:39:24.910 --> 03:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
tradition of supporting Reproductive
 
03:39:27.710 --> 03:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
Rights by voting against harmful
 
03:39:29.910 --> 03:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
legislation but it's not enough to vote
 
03:39:31.950 --> 03:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
against abortion restrictions and bans
 
03:39:34.469 --> 03:39:34.479 align:start position:0%
our constituents would like us to vote
 
03:39:36.990 --> 03:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
proactively to support access to
 
03:39:40.189 --> 03:39:40.199 align:start position:0%
abortion it's important we as an elected
 
03:39:42.030 --> 03:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
body need to show Granite Staters our
 
03:39:44.030 --> 03:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
values our priorities and our firm and
 
03:39:46.150 --> 03:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
clear position and we can do that by
 
03:39:48.469 --> 03:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
passing HCR
 
03:39:51.229 --> 03:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
7 so I respectfully urge you all on the
 
03:39:53.550 --> 03:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
committee and our colleagues to vote
 
03:39:56.630 --> 03:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on HCR 7 uh a commitment
 
03:39:58.630 --> 03:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
and an action to not further restrict
 
03:40:00.510 --> 03:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
abortion rights in New
 
03:40:02.389 --> 03:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and now I'll take any
 
03:40:05.510 --> 03:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
questions that you all have thank you
 
03:40:09.349 --> 03:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
representative any questions from the
 
03:40:12.670 --> 03:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative L Montaine
 
03:40:15.590 --> 03:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um do
 
03:40:17.550 --> 03:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
you know of other states outside of New
 
03:40:22.510 --> 03:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:25.870 --> 03:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
resolutions um I don't I mostly looked
 
03:40:29.990 --> 03:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
at New England where um the right to
 
03:40:32.349 --> 03:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
abortion up to 24 weeks is codified
 
03:40:34.710 --> 03:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
instate law so there wouldn't um
 
03:40:36.670 --> 03:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily be a need for a resolution
 
03:40:36.680 --> 03:40:37.670 align:start position:0%
necessarily be a need for a resolution
like

03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:40:37.680 --> 03:40:39.910 align:start position:0%
like
this

03:40:39.910 --> 03:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:40:51.389 --> 03:40:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:53.790 --> 03:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Madame chair and thank you for
 
03:40:57.670 --> 03:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:01.750 --> 03:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
question so this bill uh says uh
 
03:41:07.469 --> 03:41:07.479 align:start position:0%
that uh PRI prior to 24 weeks uh
 
03:41:11.389 --> 03:41:11.399 align:start position:0%
gestation um so my question would
 
03:41:16.469 --> 03:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
be how you define a comprehensive
 
03:41:19.349 --> 03:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh reproductive Health
 
03:41:24.870 --> 03:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
Care uh because sometimes uh abortion is
 
03:41:29.630 --> 03:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
made based on uh threat
 
03:41:35.030 --> 03:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
to uh women's uh health and sometimes uh
 
03:41:38.990 --> 03:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
it could be more of a choice
 
03:41:47.269 --> 03:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:50.469 --> 03:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
so from my perspective and the folks
 
03:41:52.630 --> 03:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
that I'm representing it's really
 
03:41:55.189 --> 03:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
important that decisions about health
 
03:41:56.710 --> 03:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
care reproductive healthare and
 
03:42:00.229 --> 03:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
otherwise are made between doctors and
 
03:42:02.590 --> 03:42:02.600 align:start position:0%
women so doctors and the person who's
 
03:42:05.550 --> 03:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
pregnant um so I
 
03:42:08.229 --> 03:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
would I would leave those decisions up
 
03:42:11.189 --> 03:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:14.149 --> 03:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
providers representative
 
03:42:16.110 --> 03:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:42:18.670 --> 03:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so we we have
 
03:42:20.990 --> 03:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
some some varying statutes that are
 
03:42:23.269 --> 03:42:23.279 align:start position:0%
specific with respect to dates so the
 
03:42:25.309 --> 03:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
fetal Life protection act it it
 
03:42:28.590 --> 03:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
references 24 weeks and and it has to
 
03:42:30.389 --> 03:42:30.399 align:start position:0%
reference a specific time because
 
03:42:32.189 --> 03:42:32.199 align:start position:0%
obviously you want to give people
 
03:42:35.149 --> 03:42:35.159 align:start position:0%
Clarity right and the same thing we have
 
03:42:37.750 --> 03:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
with our our our female fetal homicide
 
03:42:40.469 --> 03:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
law which was used the first time last
 
03:42:43.149 --> 03:42:43.159 align:start position:0%
year which basically sets it at 20 weeks
 
03:42:45.710 --> 03:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
and you want to be very clear you know
 
03:42:49.269 --> 03:42:49.279 align:start position:0%
so if if in in the case of of the the
 
03:42:51.790 --> 03:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
criminal action last year the woman was
 
03:42:54.910 --> 03:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
37 and the fetus was over 20 weeks and
 
03:42:58.229 --> 03:42:58.239 align:start position:0%
so the the person was charged with two
 
03:42:59.990 --> 03:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
murders as opposed to one but had the
 
03:43:02.750 --> 03:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
fetus just been 18 weeks they would have
 
03:43:04.990 --> 03:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
just been charged with the one murder so
 
03:43:06.870 --> 03:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the statutes we have
 
03:43:09.269 --> 03:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
this specificity to be as clear as
 
03:43:12.469 --> 03:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
possible but this is a resolution and so
 
03:43:15.189 --> 03:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering um your thought proc
 
03:43:18.630 --> 03:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
process you know rather than like say at
 
03:43:20.510 --> 03:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
at a point of viability or something
 
03:43:22.830 --> 03:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
like that you're coming in with a with a
 
03:43:25.950 --> 03:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
hard number 24 weeks and what was your
 
03:43:28.309 --> 03:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
thinking behind uh you know that number
 
03:43:30.870 --> 03:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
specifically because it may evolve so
 
03:43:32.990 --> 03:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
just if you could kind
 
03:43:35.110 --> 03:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
of if you could let me know what your
 
03:43:38.110 --> 03:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
thinking was towards the 24-week number
 
03:43:41.590 --> 03:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
sure so the um law that's on the books
 
03:43:44.429 --> 03:43:44.439 align:start position:0%
the fetal Life protection act is um up
 
03:43:49.830 --> 03:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:49.840 --> 03:43:52.349 align:start position:0%
 
resolution

03:43:52.349 --> 03:43:52.359 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
03:43:55.510 --> 03:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
yeah follow up M follow up so just
 
03:43:57.469 --> 03:43:57.479 align:start position:0%
basically that's our status quo and I
 
03:43:58.950 --> 03:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
just want to kind of hold the line on
 
03:43:58.960 --> 03:44:00.349 align:start position:0%
just want to kind of hold the line on
that

03:44:00.349 --> 03:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:44:04.550 --> 03:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
basically right now in the law that is
 
03:44:06.510 --> 03:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
what is in the fetal Life protection act
 
03:44:09.110 --> 03:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
and this resolution is attending to
 
03:44:12.550 --> 03:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
everything before what's in the law
 
03:44:14.349 --> 03:44:14.359 align:start position:0%
right now so you're so you're just
 
03:44:16.229 --> 03:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
trying to preserve of that status quo in
 
03:44:17.910 --> 03:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
the resolution
 
03:44:20.510 --> 03:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
basically I'm trying to make a statement
 
03:44:22.670 --> 03:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
and have the house make a statement that
 
03:44:25.630 --> 03:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
we affirmatively support Reproductive
 
03:44:28.750 --> 03:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
Rights and and Health Care up until 24
 
03:44:31.189 --> 03:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
weeks thank
 
03:44:34.469 --> 03:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
you representative Maser thank you Mr
 
03:44:37.910 --> 03:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
03:44:39.469 --> 03:44:39.479 align:start position:0%
so you just said right now you're in
 
03:44:41.309 --> 03:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
support of the 24 weeks would you be
 
03:44:44.550 --> 03:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
support of a resolution like that if um
 
03:44:47.110 --> 03:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
for abortion up until
 
03:44:50.110 --> 03:44:50.120 align:start position:0%
birth I think that's an inflammatory
 
03:44:52.469 --> 03:44:52.479 align:start position:0%
statement that's not an actual thing
 
03:44:56.349 --> 03:44:56.359 align:start position:0%
that happens in reproductive health care
 
03:44:58.830 --> 03:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
it's not um it's not what we're talking
 
03:45:00.510 --> 03:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
about we're talking about reproductive
 
03:45:03.670 --> 03:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
health care and
 
03:45:06.469 --> 03:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
abortion at the time of birth is not a
 
03:45:08.910 --> 03:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
health care a thing that happens in
 
03:45:12.429 --> 03:45:12.439 align:start position:0%
healthare so I'm not going to talk about
 
03:45:15.469 --> 03:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
that a quick followup follow quick
 
03:45:18.110 --> 03:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
clarification I said up until
 
03:45:22.349 --> 03:45:22.359 align:start position:0%
birth not right and I am saying that
 
03:45:25.830 --> 03:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
abortion up until birth does not happen
 
03:45:27.469 --> 03:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
I think it might be helpful for you to
 
03:45:29.830 --> 03:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
ask that question of a provider of
 
03:45:32.349 --> 03:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
Health Care who may be testifying after
 
03:45:36.469 --> 03:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
me but um that's not something I'm going
 
03:45:38.030 --> 03:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
to talk
 
03:45:41.309 --> 03:45:41.319 align:start position:0%
about other
 
03:45:43.630 --> 03:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing no other questions
 
03:45:51.750 --> 03:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:53.469 --> 03:45:53.479 align:start position:0%

means fewer abortions in New Hampshire
 
03:47:38.229 --> 03:47:38.239 align:start position:0%
also means fewer OBGYN procedures for

03:48:09.309 --> 03:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
right abortion bans cause New
 
03:48:13.309 --> 03:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's existing OBG to suffer while
 
03:48:15.309 --> 03:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
they work to deliver patient care
 
03:48:18.389 --> 03:48:18.399 align:start position:0%
to fear fines imprisonment and loss of
 
03:48:21.630 --> 03:48:21.640 align:start position:0%

03:48:23.590 --> 03:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
to experience mental health challenges
 
03:48:25.590 --> 03:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
as a result and then to become more
 
03:48:28.110 --> 03:48:28.120 align:start position:0%
likely to leave their states of practice
 
03:48:31.510 --> 03:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
for states without the abortion banss so
 
03:48:34.389 --> 03:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
yes fewer abortions mean fewer existing

03:48:43.870 --> 03:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
findings are directly reflected here in

current law limiting one subset of

state third I'm here to relay an
 
03:49:08.189 --> 03:49:08.199 align:start position:0%
important constituent story for your
 
03:49:10.950 --> 03:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
consideration an OBG physician who's a
 
03:49:12.830 --> 03:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
professor at the G Gil school of
 
03:49:16.590 --> 03:49:16.600 align:start position:0%
medicine and um the darmouth area who is
 
03:49:18.269 --> 03:49:18.279 align:start position:0%
also licensed to practice here in New
 
03:49:20.590 --> 03:49:20.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Vermont reports that the
 
03:49:22.429 --> 03:49:22.439 align:start position:0%
legislative limits on this Medical
 
03:49:24.710 --> 03:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
Practice in New Hampshire are pushing
 
03:49:26.550 --> 03:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
him to stop offering his Provider
 
03:49:28.750 --> 03:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
Services in New Hampshire and move his
 
03:49:31.550 --> 03:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
clinical practice exclusively to Vermont
 
03:49:33.469 --> 03:49:33.479 align:start position:0%
he feels that the laws regulating
 
03:49:35.309 --> 03:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
abortion care in New Hampshire are an
 
03:49:37.229 --> 03:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
unfair intrusion on his medical
 
03:49:39.149 --> 03:49:39.159 align:start position:0%
decision-making which follow national
 
03:49:41.910 --> 03:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
standards of care and are also an unfair
 
03:49:44.269 --> 03:49:44.279 align:start position:0%
judgment upon his medical expertise he
 
03:49:45.870 --> 03:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
can EAS move his practice to an
 
03:49:47.870 --> 03:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
environment more supportive of his
 
03:49:50.030 --> 03:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
practice without suffering repercussions
 
03:49:51.950 --> 03:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
and there is nothing holding him back
 
03:49:53.870 --> 03:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
other than recognizing that New
 
03:49:55.630 --> 03:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be become more of a
 
03:49:57.189 --> 03:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
reproductive Healthcare desert than it
 
03:49:58.870 --> 03:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
already is if you could start wrapping
 
03:50:02.750 --> 03:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
up please y so this resolution if passed
 
03:50:04.910 --> 03:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
would provide this doctor and the rest
 
03:50:07.630 --> 03:50:07.640 align:start position:0%
of the state's OBGYN as a signal of
 
03:50:09.429 --> 03:50:09.439 align:start position:0%
support that New Hampshire trusts its
 
03:50:11.910 --> 03:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
OBGYN Physicians and values their
 
03:50:11.920 --> 03:50:13.070 align:start position:0%
OBGYN Physicians and values their
difficult

03:50:13.070 --> 03:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
03:50:17.110 --> 03:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
work prior um prior to the 24-week band
 
03:50:19.550 --> 03:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
so protecting this vital access to
 
03:50:21.590 --> 03:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
abortion care is just one important part
 
03:50:23.910 --> 03:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
of this clinical work and passing this
 
03:50:25.269 --> 03:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
resolution will
 
03:50:27.670 --> 03:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
assure more doctors like him that New
 
03:50:29.349 --> 03:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is serious about giving
 
03:50:32.429 --> 03:50:32.439 align:start position:0%
providers all the tools they need to be
 
03:50:34.070 --> 03:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
the to provide the best care for their
 
03:50:36.710 --> 03:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
patients and their patients families so
 
03:50:38.469 --> 03:50:38.479 align:start position:0%
it's an important moral Victory I really
 
03:50:41.830 --> 03:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
think you should consider so um for
 
03:50:43.590 --> 03:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
these reasons Mr chair and members of
 
03:50:46.030 --> 03:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
the committee I urge you to support this
 
03:50:47.950 --> 03:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
resolution and with that I thank you for
 
03:50:49.189 --> 03:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
your attention I would be happy to
 
03:50:50.870 --> 03:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might have
 
03:50:53.710 --> 03:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative palaz off thank
 
03:50:55.830 --> 03:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:50:58.309 --> 03:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
question so you you mentioned
 
03:51:01.950 --> 03:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
significant decline uh in some numbers
 
03:51:07.070 --> 03:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh is related to OBG YN and some
 
03:51:11.070 --> 03:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
enrollments could you put some number or
 
03:51:14.030 --> 03:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of percentage is it like 1%
 
03:51:16.630 --> 03:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
decline like how much I'd be happy to
 
03:51:19.349 --> 03:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
forward you the study after
 
03:51:22.790 --> 03:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:25.510 --> 03:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative mlan thank you
 
03:51:26.830 --> 03:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:51:30.149 --> 03:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
question so I mean obviously um abortion
 
03:51:32.950 --> 03:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
is is is a very you know divisive issue
 
03:51:34.950 --> 03:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
and people come down on multiple sides
 
03:51:38.510 --> 03:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
of it um and and so it it can be a
 
03:51:40.630 --> 03:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
difficult discussion but you talked
 
03:51:43.870 --> 03:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
about um the fact that since uh our
 
03:51:47.389 --> 03:51:47.399 align:start position:0%
existing went into effect we've seen um
 
03:51:50.149 --> 03:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
a loss of service and you you gave the
 
03:51:52.990 --> 03:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
specific example of a of a physician who
 
03:51:55.149 --> 03:51:55.159 align:start position:0%
who moved his practice to to Vermont
 
03:51:59.030 --> 03:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
which is a a tangible effect so you know
 
03:52:01.389 --> 03:52:01.399 align:start position:0%
in light of that
 
03:52:04.510 --> 03:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
um what what is your objective I mean
 
03:52:06.070 --> 03:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
you you could go back and you could
 
03:52:08.670 --> 03:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
revisit the statute or you could look
 
03:52:10.630 --> 03:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
like some other states have done at a
 
03:52:13.030 --> 03:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment instead you're
 
03:52:15.070 --> 03:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
choosing the path of this
 
03:52:17.710 --> 03:52:17.720 align:start position:0%
resolution um and I'm I which I I don't
 
03:52:19.870 --> 03:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
really think has all that much teeth to
 
03:52:23.710 --> 03:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
it and so what are you seeing that the
 
03:52:25.229 --> 03:52:25.239 align:start position:0%
gain is going to be from this I'm just
 
03:52:26.590 --> 03:52:26.600 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
03:52:28.750 --> 03:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
understand thank you for the question
 
03:52:31.550 --> 03:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative so as I was finishing up
 
03:52:33.830 --> 03:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
my remarks I talked about the important
 
03:52:35.710 --> 03:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
signal it would send to doctors who
 
03:52:37.830 --> 03:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
practice in this field that New
 
03:52:40.110 --> 03:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's legislators actually care
 
03:52:42.910 --> 03:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
about people and they put people over
 
03:52:45.950 --> 03:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
politics U recogn ing that this simple
 
03:52:48.189 --> 03:52:48.199 align:start position:0%
subset procedure of an overall practice
 
03:52:51.309 --> 03:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
is being limited for more or less
 
03:52:54.830 --> 03:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
arbitrary you know purposes it's um you
 
03:52:57.469 --> 03:52:57.479 align:start position:0%
know a policy decision um but if you
 
03:52:59.950 --> 03:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
were to support the resolution you would
 
03:53:01.389 --> 03:53:01.399 align:start position:0%
let them know that the rest of their
 
03:53:03.670 --> 03:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
practice is supported and that their
 
03:53:05.710 --> 03:53:05.720 align:start position:0%
jobs and their hard work their difficult
 
03:53:07.790 --> 03:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
decision-making prior to 24 weeks is
 
03:53:09.910 --> 03:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
valued because we understand that this
 
03:53:11.750 --> 03:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
subset procedure for the overall
 
03:53:14.990 --> 03:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
practice is required prior to 20 4 weeks
 
03:53:17.910 --> 03:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
in many cases to in order to keep the
 
03:53:20.229 --> 03:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
regular reproductive healthare of our
 
03:53:22.670 --> 03:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
Granite State reproductive folks you
 
03:53:26.510 --> 03:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
know in a healthy position so um I do
 
03:53:28.189 --> 03:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
not believe that they are separated I
 
03:53:30.070 --> 03:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
think that these two things can live in
 
03:53:32.510 --> 03:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
the same space and coexist in in a
 
03:53:35.189 --> 03:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
meaningful way um just because we have
 
03:53:36.990 --> 03:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
something after 24 weeks doesn't mean
 
03:53:39.189 --> 03:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
that we can't affirm what they're doing
 
03:53:42.630 --> 03:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
prior to 24 weeks so um I think that
 
03:53:44.590 --> 03:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
signal is important for the physician
 
03:53:47.349 --> 03:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
who are working here to address almost
 
03:53:48.950 --> 03:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
every single one of our families has a
 
03:53:52.149 --> 03:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
female who has been or will be or could
 
03:53:55.149 --> 03:53:55.159 align:start position:0%
become pregnant so um the support that
 
03:53:57.830 --> 03:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
you could show with this resolution um
 
03:54:00.149 --> 03:54:00.159 align:start position:0%
would be very powerful for their morale
 
03:54:01.950 --> 03:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
um considering the previous attacks that
 
03:54:03.910 --> 03:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
they've had on their profession but more
 
03:54:05.550 --> 03:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
than that I think that the signal would
 
03:54:08.670 --> 03:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
also be sent to every um patient patient
 
03:54:10.910 --> 03:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
family member or simply persons who love
 
03:54:13.870 --> 03:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
a patient who could become pregnant by
 
03:54:16.070 --> 03:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
showing them that Healthcare is we
 
03:54:17.710 --> 03:54:17.720 align:start position:0%
understand Healthcare is complex it's
 
03:54:19.910 --> 03:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
personal and it's private prior to 24
 
03:54:21.870 --> 03:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
weeks and so that's the meaning of our
 
03:54:24.189 --> 03:54:24.199 align:start position:0%
resolution today
 
03:54:26.189 --> 03:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
follow thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:54:28.710 --> 03:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so and and I
 
03:54:30.389 --> 03:54:30.399 align:start position:0%
understand you know your comments about
 
03:54:32.630 --> 03:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh the the moral position that it Stakes
 
03:54:36.309 --> 03:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
out um in your conversation uh with the
 
03:54:38.630 --> 03:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
positions that that you're representing
 
03:54:40.870 --> 03:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
um have any of them commented to you
 
03:54:43.030 --> 03:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
including perhaps this position that's
 
03:54:45.309 --> 03:54:45.319 align:start position:0%
moving to Vermont where they said if
 
03:54:47.189 --> 03:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
this was to pass even though this is
 
03:54:49.309 --> 03:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
something that you know structurally has
 
03:54:52.510 --> 03:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
no teeth it would be enough for us to
 
03:54:54.030 --> 03:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
consider moving
 
03:54:56.550 --> 03:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
back um well I can't put words into the
 
03:54:58.429 --> 03:54:58.439 align:start position:0%
person's mouth no but I have had several
 
03:55:00.269 --> 03:55:00.279 align:start position:0%
conversations with practicing physicians
 
03:55:02.710 --> 03:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
in the state who believe this affir like
 
03:55:05.070 --> 03:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
this resolution or affirmative support
 
03:55:07.349 --> 03:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
of their work prior to 24 weeks is
 
03:55:09.750 --> 03:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
critical for what they do in the state
 
03:55:11.670 --> 03:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
not only because it would provide some
 
03:55:13.750 --> 03:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
legislative intent for you know in terms
 
03:55:16.550 --> 03:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
of how the legislature feels prior to 24
 
03:55:18.830 --> 03:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
weeks but also because it would show you
 
03:55:20.149 --> 03:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
know that professional support I was
 
03:55:21.870 --> 03:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
just speaking with you about the
 
03:55:24.910 --> 03:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
morale thank you representative Markel
 
03:55:26.030 --> 03:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
did you have your hand up then
 
03:55:27.990 --> 03:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
03:55:31.429 --> 03:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
call my question um so ma'am earlier we
 
03:55:33.030 --> 03:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
heard it discussed that there's no
 
03:55:34.870 --> 03:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
abortion basically if I heard it
 
03:55:37.429 --> 03:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
correctly and perhaps you can clarify
 
03:55:39.269 --> 03:55:39.279 align:start position:0%
this for me uh that there's no
 
03:55:40.950 --> 03:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
protections for abortion in New
 
03:55:42.790 --> 03:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire however could you please
 
03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
comment on RSA 3
 
03:55:48.510 --> 03:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
2944 which addresses the issue that uh
 
03:55:50.349 --> 03:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
that basically says no abortion will be
 
03:55:53.349 --> 03:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
performed after 24 weeks unless there is
 
03:55:56.110 --> 03:55:56.120 align:start position:0%
a medical emergency doesn't isn't that
 
03:55:59.309 --> 03:55:59.319 align:start position:0%
enough for you to satisfy this uh this
 
03:56:02.309 --> 03:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
particular call and satisfy the um
 
03:56:04.910 --> 03:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
problems that you say some of the OBGYNs
 
03:56:08.030 --> 03:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
are having uh thank you for the question
 
03:56:11.389 --> 03:56:11.399 align:start position:0%
um to respond I would say um the
 
03:56:13.630 --> 03:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
question addressed to the earlier Prime
 
03:56:16.070 --> 03:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor was outside the scope of this
 
03:56:19.630 --> 03:56:19.640 align:start position:0%
resolution okay um so I would decline to
 
03:56:21.349 --> 03:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
comment based on that it's not really
 
03:56:23.469 --> 03:56:23.479 align:start position:0%
the resolution we're discuss discussing
 
03:56:26.429 --> 03:56:26.439 align:start position:0%
here today um I just don't think that's
 
03:56:28.630 --> 03:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
relevant to the discussion we're trying
 
03:56:31.309 --> 03:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
to hold so I'm sorry I can't comment
 
03:56:33.469 --> 03:56:33.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
03:56:36.110 --> 03:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
palaza thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:56:40.750 --> 03:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
taking another question from me so uh uh
 
03:56:43.149 --> 03:56:43.159 align:start position:0%
in the bill title and in the bill you
 
03:56:46.309 --> 03:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
talk about cre iCal component so how do
 
03:56:49.269 --> 03:56:49.279 align:start position:0%
you define a critical component is it
 
03:56:52.590 --> 03:56:52.600 align:start position:0%
does it mean that it is equal in
 
03:56:55.149 --> 03:56:55.159 align:start position:0%
importance to other components or are
 
03:56:58.229 --> 03:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
you saying that it's more important than
 
03:57:02.870 --> 03:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
some other uh components of
 
03:57:05.950 --> 03:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
healthcare thank you for the question um
 
03:57:08.429 --> 03:57:08.439 align:start position:0%
no if you'll go back to refer to my
 
03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
previous statements I mentioned that
 
03:57:14.269 --> 03:57:14.279 align:start position:0%
abortion care is one subset of the tools
 
03:57:16.630 --> 03:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
in the practice area that
 
03:57:19.309 --> 03:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
OBG are responsible for in their sco
 
03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
practice so um I don't believe one is
 
03:57:23.750 --> 03:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
more important than the other I think
 
03:57:25.110 --> 03:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the idea of the
 
03:57:27.110 --> 03:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
resolution is to show that each subset
 
03:57:28.910 --> 03:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
of the practice area is part of the
 
03:57:31.229 --> 03:57:31.239 align:start position:0%
comprehensive reproductive health care
 
03:57:34.510 --> 03:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
that all Granite Staters
 
03:57:39.229 --> 03:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
deserve other questions representative
 
03:57:42.229 --> 03:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
McGrath thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:57:45.110 --> 03:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
taking my questions I'm
 
03:57:47.070 --> 03:57:47.080 align:start position:0%
I'm still confused by the doctor who's
 
03:57:49.830 --> 03:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
moving to Vermont what
 
03:57:54.510 --> 03:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
are if if it's because of our
 
03:57:57.590 --> 03:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
abortion after 24 weeks what is
 
03:57:57.600 --> 03:58:00.070 align:start position:0%
abortion after 24 weeks what is
Vermont's

03:58:00.070 --> 03:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
Vermont's
 
03:58:05.269 --> 03:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
law uh I am not um fully studied on the
 
03:58:07.189 --> 03:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
like expanded nature of the Vermont law
 
03:58:08.429 --> 03:58:08.439 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that they do
 
03:58:09.670 --> 03:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
have a constitutional amendment
 
03:58:11.269 --> 03:58:11.279 align:start position:0%
affirming the right to abortion in
 
03:58:15.550 --> 03:58:15.560 align:start position:0%
Vermont so they have um spoken in their
 
03:58:19.030 --> 03:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
law where where our law is silent so
 
03:58:20.510 --> 03:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
they have actually made affirmative
 
03:58:22.510 --> 03:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
Protections in their law through a
 
03:58:24.389 --> 03:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment our state has
 
03:58:27.269 --> 03:58:27.279 align:start position:0%
no affirmative Protections in law prior
 
03:58:29.550 --> 03:58:29.560 align:start position:0%
to 24
 
03:58:32.710 --> 03:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
weeks representative CLE ring I iose
 
03:58:34.670 --> 03:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
just to end the comment I suppose the
 
03:58:37.830 --> 03:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
doctor realizes that his practice he's
 
03:58:39.550 --> 03:58:39.560 align:start position:0%
not under criminal threat for his full
 
03:58:41.070 --> 03:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
scope of practice in the state of
 
03:58:42.670 --> 03:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
Vermont where he is under criminal
 
03:58:44.790 --> 03:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
threat and civil Li ility here in the
 
03:58:47.590 --> 03:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so his benefit to
 
03:58:49.910 --> 03:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
moving his practice in Vermont for his
 
03:58:53.349 --> 03:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
professional lure purposes is a a lower
 
03:58:55.309 --> 03:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
risk practice field in Vermont than it
 
03:58:56.990 --> 03:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
is here in New
 
03:58:59.670 --> 03:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative custle wi thank
 
03:59:00.990 --> 03:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
03:59:02.910 --> 03:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
question so I heard you mention about
 
03:59:05.510 --> 03:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
the doctors you're speaking for today um
 
03:59:07.229 --> 03:59:07.239 align:start position:0%
is there in your study anything that
 
03:59:09.309 --> 03:59:09.319 align:start position:0%
shows the pregnancy rate decreasing in
 
03:59:11.309 --> 03:59:11.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um because I would be
 
03:59:12.910 --> 03:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
concerned that that would be one of the
 
03:59:15.590 --> 03:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
reasons that the doctors would leave uh
 
03:59:16.830 --> 03:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I will make
 
03:59:18.830 --> 03:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
sure to forward both of the studies to
 
03:59:20.630 --> 03:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
the committee so that they can look this
 
03:59:23.030 --> 03:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
is a national peer-reviewed study since
 
03:59:25.910 --> 03:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
the fall um Ro versus Wade and the dobs
 
03:59:29.110 --> 03:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
decision so um it it just measured the
 
03:59:33.030 --> 03:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh I think 11 states that reversed um
 
03:59:35.149 --> 03:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
the abortion rights since that happened
 
03:59:37.389 --> 03:59:37.399 align:start position:0%
so I will be sure to pass along both
 
03:59:39.030 --> 03:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
studies to the committee so you can
 
03:59:41.510 --> 03:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
fully inform yourself of the um the
 
03:59:43.790 --> 03:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
Journal of American Medical Association
 
03:59:46.830 --> 03:59:46.840 align:start position:0%
uh published studies from 2024 so that's
 
03:59:48.389 --> 03:59:48.399 align:start position:0%
like a short window of time to turn
 
03:59:50.870 --> 03:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
around the the end of do you know the
 
03:59:53.630 --> 03:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
do's decision and these um these studies
 
03:59:55.349 --> 03:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
but you know that information is limited
 
03:59:56.910 --> 03:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't think it's siloed to which
 
03:59:58.830 --> 03:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
states other than the ones that have
 
03:59:58.840 --> 04:00:00.349 align:start position:0%
states other than the ones that have
passed

04:00:00.349 --> 04:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
passed
 
04:00:03.670 --> 04:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
bans other
 
04:00:08.830 --> 04:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:11.189 --> 04:00:11.199 align:start position:0%

happened to be a

nun there were times when the only
 
04:02:25.950 --> 04:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
option to save the mother's life was to
 
04:02:28.950 --> 04:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
medically end her pregnancy as

04:02:34.349 --> 04:02:34.359 align:start position:0%
me personally I never believed we had
 
04:02:35.550 --> 04:02:35.560 align:start position:0%
made the wrong
 
04:02:39.670 --> 04:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
choice and it was an informed Choice

made without the unnecessary pressure of

if they have a good experience in

obstetric and gynecologic care they are
 
04:04:10.990 --> 04:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
likely to refer their family members for

other kinds of care to the same facility
 
04:04:16.469 --> 04:04:16.479 align:start position:0%

understand correctly you're working
 
04:04:50.189 --> 04:04:50.199 align:start position:0%
mainly for a Catholic um Health

04:04:57.990 --> 04:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
had uh policies that not did not allow

elective
 
04:05:04.750 --> 04:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
abortion but in the case of a medical
 
04:05:08.189 --> 04:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
emergency um there was no prohibition to
 
04:05:11.309 --> 04:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
doing what you had to do as the provider
 
04:05:14.950 --> 04:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:14.960 --> 04:05:16.309 align:start position:0%

04:05:16.309 --> 04:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:05:19.030 --> 04:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and and thank
 
04:05:20.469 --> 04:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question and thank you
 
04:05:24.110 --> 04:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
for sharing your insights as well um so
 
04:05:28.070 --> 04:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
um already in Statute in New Hampshire
 
04:05:31.269 --> 04:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
is the statutory guarantee of
 
04:05:34.070 --> 04:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
unrestricted access to abortion through
 
04:05:38.790 --> 04:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
24 weeks this resolution basically
 
04:05:40.149 --> 04:05:40.159 align:start position:0%
preserves that it says yeah we're going
 
04:05:43.189 --> 04:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
to 24 weeks but you know if you look at
 
04:05:46.030 --> 04:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
the last matter of protection being
 
04:05:49.429 --> 04:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
offered the statutory protections far
 
04:05:52.149 --> 04:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
outweigh any protections that may be
 
04:05:56.030 --> 04:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
gained from a resolution and so when I I
 
04:05:59.070 --> 04:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
heard the earlier testimony um about
 
04:06:02.070 --> 04:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
someone who had left to go to Vermont
 
04:06:03.790 --> 04:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
the reason that they were leaving to go
 
04:06:07.590 --> 04:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
to Vermont was because in Vermont it was
 
04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
higher up on the ladder still in that it
 
04:06:13.750 --> 04:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
was a constitutional protection and so I
 
04:06:15.349 --> 04:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm still trying to
 
04:06:17.710 --> 04:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
understand is having already achieved
 
04:06:21.349 --> 04:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
the statutory protection which is higher
 
04:06:24.630 --> 04:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
than the resolution I'm still trying to
 
04:06:26.750 --> 04:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
understand what it is that you're trying
 
04:06:29.630 --> 04:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
to achieve with this I I don't know that
 
04:06:32.790 --> 04:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to be able to you know bring
 
04:06:36.269 --> 04:06:36.279 align:start position:0%
back um the the Physicians and the
 
04:06:39.710 --> 04:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
Obstetricians because the the the the
 
04:06:41.309 --> 04:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
life- saving care where you had to
 
04:06:43.630 --> 04:06:43.640 align:start position:0%
basically make the decision to save the
 
04:06:46.149 --> 04:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
life of the mother um that's all
 
04:06:49.710 --> 04:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
protected within the existing statute so
 
04:06:52.510 --> 04:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm trying to ask is where
 
04:06:55.510 --> 04:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
does the resolution take you because
 
04:06:57.110 --> 04:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's it doesn't even give you that
 
04:07:00.309 --> 04:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
same level that a statute does thank you
 
04:07:03.149 --> 04:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
I I think I'm looking at this more as a
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
statement of
 
04:07:04.319 --> 04:07:05.910 align:start position:0%
statement of
reassurance

04:07:05.910 --> 04:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
reassurance
 
04:07:09.110 --> 04:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
to Future Physicians who are considering
 
04:07:12.510 --> 04:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
practicing here I have
 
04:07:17.710 --> 04:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
um after 37 years um of of instruction I
 
04:07:20.910 --> 04:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
have literally hundreds of graduates uh
 
04:07:22.950 --> 04:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
of The Residency program where I was a
 
04:07:22.960 --> 04:07:23.990 align:start position:0%
of The Residency program where I was a
clinical

04:07:23.990 --> 04:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
clinical
 
04:07:27.349 --> 04:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
instructor and I know that because I'm
 
04:07:29.109 --> 04:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
in touch with quite a few of them that
 
04:07:30.950 --> 04:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
many of them have made a decision to
 
04:07:30.960 --> 04:07:32.149 align:start position:0%
many of them have made a decision to
leave

04:07:32.149 --> 04:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
leave
 
04:07:35.710 --> 04:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
States uh who have enacted stricter
 
04:07:35.720 --> 04:07:37.790 align:start position:0%
States uh who have enacted stricter
abortion

04:07:37.790 --> 04:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
04:07:37.800 --> 04:07:40.109 align:start position:0%
abortion
uh

04:07:40.109 --> 04:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:07:42.670 --> 04:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
restrictions and they are also leaving
 
04:07:44.510 --> 04:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
states where they
 
04:07:48.870 --> 04:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
are not aware of a firm commitment to
 
04:07:51.070 --> 04:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
protecting re women's Reproductive
 
04:07:52.429 --> 04:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
Rights because they're concerned about
 
04:07:57.109 --> 04:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
the future so I think that this
 
04:07:59.510 --> 04:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
resonates with me because I'm hearing
 
04:08:01.710 --> 04:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
about those decisions and I'm concerned
 
04:08:03.510 --> 04:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
about what could happen in New
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire follow up and and so again
 
04:08:08.950 --> 04:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
with with the extensive conversations
 
04:08:11.630 --> 04:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
that you have with these folks
 
04:08:14.189 --> 04:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
um understanding that the law is already
 
04:08:14.199 --> 04:08:16.030 align:start position:0%
um understanding that the law is already
there

04:08:16.030 --> 04:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:08:18.550 --> 04:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
um have you had discussions with them
 
04:08:21.309 --> 04:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
about this resolution and you know is it
 
04:08:23.950 --> 04:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
a game Cher in any way for them would it
 
04:08:26.910 --> 04:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
move the needle for them or you know I'm
 
04:08:28.590 --> 04:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
just trying to I'm just trying to
 
04:08:30.550 --> 04:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
understand the substantive impact that
 
04:08:33.429 --> 04:08:33.439 align:start position:0%
this would have well for the former
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
residents who
 
04:08:39.389 --> 04:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
are considering changing location and
 
04:08:41.309 --> 04:08:41.319 align:start position:0%
they're if they look at the New England
 
04:08:43.510 --> 04:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
states I know that they're not looking
 
04:08:44.550 --> 04:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
at New
 
04:08:47.750 --> 04:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for that reason
 
04:08:50.189 --> 04:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
04:08:52.990 --> 04:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chair and before I
 
04:08:55.269 --> 04:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
ask my question I am a co-sponsor of
 
04:08:56.910 --> 04:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
this bill but it is my understanding
 
04:08:58.830 --> 04:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
that I am allowed to ask a question if
 
04:09:00.990 --> 04:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not testifying that that is correct
 
04:09:05.550 --> 04:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:10.510 --> 04:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
clarify am I correct that the intent
 
04:09:12.870 --> 04:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
here let let me start at a different
 
04:09:16.109 --> 04:09:16.119 align:start position:0%
from the other end isn't it true that
 
04:09:19.950 --> 04:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
the criminal statute is a Prohibition
 
04:09:24.030 --> 04:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
that starts at 24 weeks and goes
 
04:09:27.510 --> 04:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
forward and whatever concerns I have
 
04:09:29.950 --> 04:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
about the way that's written for people
 
04:09:32.870 --> 04:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
Beyond 24 weeks is irrelevant to this
 
04:09:35.630 --> 04:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
particular piece of legislation but but
 
04:09:40.149 --> 04:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
what this legislation does is speak
 
04:09:42.510 --> 04:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
affirmatively to the intent of the
 
04:09:42.520 --> 04:09:45.349 align:start position:0%
affirmatively to the intent of the
legislature

04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:49.229 --> 04:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
about abortion prior to 24 weeks which
 
04:09:52.830 --> 04:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
is a subject on which our current law is
 
04:09:56.590 --> 04:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
silent and that's the difference correct
 
04:10:00.550 --> 04:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I uh representative palaza
 
04:10:02.229 --> 04:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:10:05.670 --> 04:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I wonder about
 
04:10:08.630 --> 04:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
what effects this bill uh we'll have on
 
04:10:11.550 --> 04:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so uh as far as I heard
 
04:10:14.229 --> 04:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
from other sponsors uh of this build
 
04:10:17.590 --> 04:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
testifying here today that they look to
 
04:10:20.870 --> 04:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
attract and retain more Specialists
 
04:10:23.750 --> 04:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
performing abortions to New Hampshire so
 
04:10:25.870 --> 04:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
it's probably safe to say that there
 
04:10:29.269 --> 04:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
will be more abortions performed in New
 
04:10:32.550 --> 04:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a effect uh if this
 
04:10:37.510 --> 04:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
resolution to pass uh so can we say that
 
04:10:40.469 --> 04:10:40.479 align:start position:0%
this this will have effect of New
 
04:10:44.109 --> 04:10:44.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire having a fewer kids
 
04:10:46.309 --> 04:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
um I think I disagree with the premise
 
04:10:49.109 --> 04:10:49.119 align:start position:0%
of your question in that I don't believe
 
04:10:49.990 --> 04:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
this would
 
04:10:54.229 --> 04:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
attract um or result in more abortions
 
04:10:56.469 --> 04:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
being performed I think it
 
04:10:58.670 --> 04:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
would helped
 
04:11:01.510 --> 04:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we had accessible and
 
04:11:03.750 --> 04:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
available reproductive Health Care to
 
04:11:06.870 --> 04:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
all women and that abortion is such a
 
04:11:12.309 --> 04:11:12.319 align:start position:0%
small part of that but when an OBGYN
 
04:11:15.389 --> 04:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
makes a decision on where to practice um
 
04:11:17.030 --> 04:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
that includes all of the other kinds of
 
04:11:19.950 --> 04:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:22.830 --> 04:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
provided other
 
04:11:25.870 --> 04:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none okay thank you
 
04:11:25.880 --> 04:11:29.950 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none okay thank you
thank

04:11:29.950 --> 04:11:29.960 align:start position:0%

radical opposition to this
 
04:12:04.550 --> 04:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
resolution um my written testimony which
 
04:12:06.349 --> 04:12:06.359 align:start position:0%
I have already submitted
 
04:12:08.990 --> 04:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
online talks about the legal history and
 
04:12:10.990 --> 04:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
the foundational
 
04:12:13.910 --> 04:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
importance of protecting life in our

04:12:40.070 --> 04:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
life so this has abortion is a cancer in
 
04:12:40.080 --> 04:12:41.229 align:start position:0%
life so this has abortion is a cancer in
our

04:12:41.229 --> 04:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:12:44.630 --> 04:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
society and has corrupted that uh
 
04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
virtually every area it touches the law
 
04:12:51.790 --> 04:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
medicine and since we're talking about a
 
04:12:53.309 --> 04:12:53.319 align:start position:0%
healthc care
 
04:12:56.030 --> 04:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Care we'll talk
 
04:12:56.040 --> 04:12:58.710 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Care we'll talk
about

04:12:58.710 --> 04:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:01.550 --> 04:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
medicine prior to the abortion regime in
 
04:13:01.560 --> 04:13:02.309 align:start position:0%
medicine prior to the abortion regime in
our

04:13:02.309 --> 04:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:13:06.910 --> 04:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
country the hypocritic oath for
 
04:13:06.920 --> 04:13:09.070 align:start position:0%
country the hypocritic oath for
centuries

04:13:09.070 --> 04:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
centuries
 
04:13:12.630 --> 04:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
eons prohibited anything that would even
 
04:13:12.640 --> 04:13:14.030 align:start position:0%
eons prohibited anything that would even
assist

04:13:14.030 --> 04:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
assist
 
04:13:17.830 --> 04:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
in The Taking of the life of the
 
04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
pre-born it's only in the
 
04:13:24.630 --> 04:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
wake of the
 
04:13:27.790 --> 04:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
abortion regime in our
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
country that the hypocritic C was
 
04:13:32.229 --> 04:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
changed to remove that
 
04:13:36.349 --> 04:13:36.359 align:start position:0%
prohibition and today's
 
04:13:40.429 --> 04:13:40.439 align:start position:0%
OBGYN many many of them have no sense
 
04:13:44.790 --> 04:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
that life itself
 
04:13:46.469 --> 04:13:46.479 align:start position:0%
is worth
 
04:13:46.479 --> 04:13:48.189 align:start position:0%
is worth
preserving

04:13:48.189 --> 04:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
preserving
 
04:13:52.830 --> 04:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
no if you call killing health care you
 
04:13:55.630 --> 04:13:55.640 align:start position:0%
can go to assisted death why not we
 
04:13:56.990 --> 04:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
heard this over and over in the
 
04:14:00.469 --> 04:14:00.479 align:start position:0%
testimony on that bill this year and
 
04:14:02.910 --> 04:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
previously because medicine now includes
 
04:14:05.670 --> 04:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
killing no it doesn't health care is
 
04:14:09.189 --> 04:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
about healing and about extending
 
04:14:11.630 --> 04:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
life so all of these things that you
 
04:14:11.640 --> 04:14:13.149 align:start position:0%
life so all of these things that you
hear

04:14:13.149 --> 04:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
hear
 
04:14:16.229 --> 04:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
and one of the things uh representative
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
palazov I think asked the important
 
04:14:19.630 --> 04:14:19.640 align:start position:0%
question would you define reproductive
 
04:14:22.950 --> 04:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
healthc care nobody
 
04:14:27.469 --> 04:14:27.479 align:start position:0%
will because it well no no nobody
 
04:14:30.070 --> 04:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
will so we shouldn't absolutely
 
04:14:32.269 --> 04:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely should be totally opposed to
 
04:14:34.670 --> 04:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
any um
 
04:14:37.309 --> 04:14:37.319 align:start position:0%
support for abortion even the Supreme
 
04:14:38.790 --> 04:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
Court of the United States when it did
 
04:14:42.510 --> 04:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
Ro versus Wade said if we knew that the
 
04:14:44.349 --> 04:14:44.359 align:start position:0%
object of that
 
04:14:47.309 --> 04:14:47.319 align:start position:0%
abortion was a human
 
04:14:49.429 --> 04:14:49.439 align:start position:0%
being abortion would already be
 
04:14:52.389 --> 04:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional by the 14th
 
04:14:54.429 --> 04:14:54.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment this is
 
04:14:59.429 --> 04:14:59.439 align:start position:0%
intolerable and useless on top of it and
 
04:15:02.030 --> 04:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
I will answer any questions thank you
 
04:15:04.590 --> 04:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
any questions representative mlan and
 
04:15:08.030 --> 04:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:10.469 --> 04:15:10.479 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:15:13.070 --> 04:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um I'm we
 
04:15:14.670 --> 04:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
going to kind of flip it a little bit
 
04:15:16.710 --> 04:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
and kind of ask you the same question
 
04:15:18.630 --> 04:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
that I were asking some of the the
 
04:15:20.790 --> 04:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
previous folks who testified you know on
 
04:15:23.830 --> 04:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
the other side of the bill um the way I
 
04:15:26.950 --> 04:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
see the hierarchy of this I I I see we
 
04:15:29.750 --> 04:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
have the fet of Life protection act it
 
04:15:33.149 --> 04:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
in my opinion codifies that you have
 
04:15:37.189 --> 04:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
access for 24 weeks um
 
04:15:39.870 --> 04:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
so and and they've made their position
 
04:15:42.990 --> 04:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
as to how it would you know benefit but
 
04:15:46.389 --> 04:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
from your position um
 
04:15:49.309 --> 04:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
tangibly within the pro-life Community
 
04:15:51.149 --> 04:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
what impact is this going to have
 
04:15:53.510 --> 04:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
because it has no teeth so where where
 
04:15:55.990 --> 04:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
do you see this having impact how do you
 
04:15:58.429 --> 04:15:58.439 align:start position:0%
see this having impact uh the Journey of
 
04:16:00.790 --> 04:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
a Thousand Miles begins with the first
 
04:16:05.630 --> 04:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
step the first step in the case of again
 
04:16:07.990 --> 04:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
abolishing or all of our abortion laws
 
04:16:09.790 --> 04:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
which has happened once before in our
 
04:16:13.429 --> 04:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:16.269 --> 04:16:16.279 align:start position:0%
is to establish that well you know
 
04:16:18.309 --> 04:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
abortion is a good thing and the house
 
04:16:20.670 --> 04:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
should be on record as supporting it and
 
04:16:23.229 --> 04:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
that's what's this about it is not about
 
04:16:25.070 --> 04:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
reproductive health care it's about
 
04:16:25.080 --> 04:16:26.149 align:start position:0%
reproductive health care it's about
killing

04:16:26.149 --> 04:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
killing
 
04:16:29.429 --> 04:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
babies and getting the house on record
 
04:16:32.469 --> 04:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
because if you say if you approve that
 
04:16:35.349 --> 04:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
phrase reproductive Health Care without
 
04:16:35.359 --> 04:16:36.189 align:start position:0%
phrase reproductive Health Care without
the

04:16:36.189 --> 04:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:16:38.510 --> 04:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
definition then it absolutely includes
 
04:16:41.550 --> 04:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
the killing of these pre-born children
 
04:16:45.710 --> 04:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
and we know that over 60
 
04:16:45.720 --> 04:16:47.550 align:start position:0%
and we know that over 60
million

04:16:47.550 --> 04:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
million
 
04:16:53.510 --> 04:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
healthy babies have been taken by
 
04:16:58.990 --> 04:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:02.030 --> 04:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
than and and it it like I said it has
 
04:17:04.429 --> 04:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
corrupted the the medical industry to
 
04:17:06.870 --> 04:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
the point where now abortion is the
 
04:17:09.710 --> 04:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
first answer if you get a a take a a
 
04:17:13.349 --> 04:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
prenatal diagnosis J Test it says you
 
04:17:19.030 --> 04:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
have markers for uh um fatal
 
04:17:21.950 --> 04:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
anomalies that could turn out to be
 
04:17:24.510 --> 04:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
serious the first thing they answer they
 
04:17:27.550 --> 04:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
they represent they recommend is
 
04:17:30.830 --> 04:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
abortion and the testimony of
 
04:17:34.030 --> 04:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
women Legions of women who were
 
04:17:35.389 --> 04:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
pressured to
 
04:17:38.149 --> 04:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
aborting for these kinds of reasons did
 
04:17:41.469 --> 04:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
and did not is
 
04:17:44.030 --> 04:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
enormous it's just the corruption of
 
04:17:48.349 --> 04:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
abortion so follow no thank you
 
04:17:51.309 --> 04:17:51.319 align:start position:0%
representative palazov thank you Mr J
 
04:17:53.389 --> 04:17:53.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
04:17:55.750 --> 04:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
04:18:00.349 --> 04:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
so uh in terms of
 
04:18:05.109 --> 04:18:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh uh so you made a good point about uh
 
04:18:07.950 --> 04:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
medical profession and
 
04:18:11.149 --> 04:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
Oban profession changing its
 
04:18:14.910 --> 04:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
philosophy but we have to deal with OBG
 
04:18:18.870 --> 04:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
YN uh the way they are today and uh
 
04:18:21.429 --> 04:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
supporters of this bill who spoke before
 
04:18:24.670 --> 04:18:24.680 align:start position:0%
you if I understood correctly they say
 
04:18:27.070 --> 04:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
that without this
 
04:18:30.269 --> 04:18:30.279 align:start position:0%
resolution we we are going to scare some
 
04:18:30.279 --> 04:18:31.670 align:start position:0%
resolution we we are going to scare some
of

04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:18:35.309 --> 04:18:35.319 align:start position:0%
OBGYN professionals and they will leave
 
04:18:37.590 --> 04:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire move to Vermont or
 
04:18:41.630 --> 04:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise and uh pregnant women will be
 
04:18:44.389 --> 04:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
left with no support at all in New
 
04:18:50.030 --> 04:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so do you share any of those
 
04:18:54.030 --> 04:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
concerns well yes and
 
04:18:57.710 --> 04:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
no I mean I believe women should have
 
04:19:00.830 --> 04:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
good health care and pregnant women and
 
04:19:00.840 --> 04:19:02.710 align:start position:0%
good health care and pregnant women and
their

04:19:02.710 --> 04:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:19:05.630 --> 04:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
babies should have good health
 
04:19:07.830 --> 04:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
care but that does not include killing
 
04:19:07.840 --> 04:19:09.510 align:start position:0%
care but that does not include killing
the

04:19:09.510 --> 04:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:19:11.790 --> 04:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
baby because that's not protecting the
 
04:19:15.950 --> 04:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
woman's Health in way over 90% of all
 
04:19:18.349 --> 04:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
cases and it's not protecting the baby's
 
04:19:20.109 --> 04:19:20.119 align:start position:0%
Health in any
 
04:19:20.119 --> 04:19:22.990 align:start position:0%
Health in any
case

04:19:22.990 --> 04:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
case
 
04:19:25.750 --> 04:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
so I guess that's the my answer to your
 
04:19:29.309 --> 04:19:29.319 align:start position:0%
question other questions representative
 
04:19:31.710 --> 04:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
Woods thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:19:35.510 --> 04:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um is there any
 
04:19:38.429 --> 04:19:38.439 align:start position:0%
circumstances that you can Envision or
 
04:19:41.870 --> 04:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
it would be a benefit for a patient to
 
04:19:45.429 --> 04:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:48.149 --> 04:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
so I got two answers to
 
04:19:51.750 --> 04:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
that and again it's yes and no but the
 
04:19:53.910 --> 04:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
yes and no in this case depend on what
 
04:19:56.670 --> 04:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
you mean by
 
04:19:59.389 --> 04:19:59.399 align:start position:0%
abortion all the all the abortion laws
 
04:20:01.469 --> 04:20:01.479 align:start position:0%
of which I
 
04:20:04.469 --> 04:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
aware allow for
 
04:20:08.510 --> 04:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
the good medical treatment of the
 
04:20:08.520 --> 04:20:10.149 align:start position:0%
the good medical treatment of the
mother

04:20:10.149 --> 04:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
mother
 
04:20:13.469 --> 04:20:13.479 align:start position:0%
and for the treatment of that
 
04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
mother to be a cause of death of the
 
04:20:23.070 --> 04:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
baby but the legal definition of
 
04:20:28.109 --> 04:20:28.119 align:start position:0%
abortion is the intentional killing of
 
04:20:32.550 --> 04:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
the innocent child the intentional
 
04:20:34.910 --> 04:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
killing right if you terminate the
 
04:20:37.149 --> 04:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
pregnancy simply to get rid of the
 
04:20:40.030 --> 04:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
child then that's not that's an illegal
 
04:20:42.189 --> 04:20:42.199 align:start position:0%
abortion that's punishable as a crime in
 
04:20:43.429 --> 04:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
our in our
 
04:20:47.349 --> 04:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
state and many others as it should
 
04:20:50.590 --> 04:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
be but if the mother has an ailment an
 
04:20:54.030 --> 04:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
illness an emergency situation that's
 
04:20:56.030 --> 04:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
threatening her
 
04:21:00.109 --> 04:21:00.119 align:start position:0%
life than trying to protect her
 
04:21:04.109 --> 04:21:04.119 align:start position:0%
life is a um ethical
 
04:21:06.070 --> 04:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
choice that has to be made by the
 
04:21:07.790 --> 04:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
medical professionals and as far as I
 
04:21:10.149 --> 04:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
know even states with abortion banss
 
04:21:11.710 --> 04:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
still allow for that kind of treatment
 
04:21:14.910 --> 04:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:14.920 --> 04:21:16.229 align:start position:0%
 
other

04:21:16.229 --> 04:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:21:23.389 --> 04:21:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:34.750 --> 04:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:37.349 --> 04:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
ferenbach all right hello my name is
 
04:21:41.030 --> 04:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
Lacy I am a New Hampshire born and
 
04:21:45.189 --> 04:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
raised I come from Auburn and I'm here
 
04:21:48.149 --> 04:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
to speak today about keeping abortions
 
04:21:50.550 --> 04:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
safe and legal in New Hampshire and I
 
04:21:52.030 --> 04:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
think the person who just spoke before
 
04:21:53.790 --> 04:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
me actually did an excellent job of
 
04:21:57.030 --> 04:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
explaining to exactly why we need this
 
04:21:58.870 --> 04:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
so as you can see we have so many people
 
04:22:01.790 --> 04:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
who really don't understand a lot about
 
04:22:03.830 --> 04:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
women's rights about women's health
 
04:22:05.870 --> 04:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
about what abortion is and how it works
 
04:22:07.910 --> 04:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
and why people are getting it and it's
 
04:22:09.710 --> 04:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
not really impacting them it's a
 
04:22:12.109 --> 04:22:12.119 align:start position:0%
hypothetical that they don't like
 
04:22:15.189 --> 04:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
meanwhile while people like me and my
 
04:22:17.790 --> 04:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
friends who are married and trying to
 
04:22:20.510 --> 04:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
have children have all decided to
 
04:22:24.109 --> 04:22:24.119 align:start position:0%
stop because they are so afraid of what
 
04:22:26.070 --> 04:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
will happen if they do become pregnant
 
04:22:28.670 --> 04:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
in the next few months and then
 
04:22:30.710 --> 04:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
everything that's currently happening in
 
04:22:33.710 --> 04:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
the current president's Administration
 
04:22:36.950 --> 04:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
happens New Hampshire residents are
 
04:22:39.109 --> 04:22:39.119 align:start position:0%
terrified right now to get pregnant and
 
04:22:40.950 --> 04:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
have children the ones who actually want
 
04:22:43.750 --> 04:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
to which means that families are going
 
04:22:45.990 --> 04:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
to be struggling to have these children
 
04:22:48.630 --> 04:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
while people who are unable to handle
 
04:22:50.670 --> 04:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
children let alone themselves are going
 
04:22:53.790 --> 04:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
to be forced to carry these kids to term
 
04:22:56.630 --> 04:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
if we get rid of abortion now I could
 
04:22:58.070 --> 04:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
sit here and say yeah we do have
 
04:22:59.750 --> 04:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
something already saying that it is
 
04:23:01.309 --> 04:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
protected but we also have people like
 
04:23:03.950 --> 04:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
Chris anunu who run on a platform of
 
04:23:06.710 --> 04:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
protecting abortion and health rights
 
04:23:08.030 --> 04:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
and then taking it away as soon as
 
04:23:10.710 --> 04:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
they're voted in um and so we need more
 
04:23:12.109 --> 04:23:12.119 align:start position:0%
protections to guarantee that you guys
 
04:23:13.590 --> 04:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
aren't going to do that and that you
 
04:23:15.870 --> 04:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be ripping away things
 
04:23:17.349 --> 04:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
that we already agreed on once but then
 
04:23:19.750 --> 04:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
another committee disagreed
 
04:23:22.389 --> 04:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
to that's what I have to
 
04:23:25.030 --> 04:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
say any
 
04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%

when I was a third-year obgy and
 
04:24:47.510 --> 04:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
clerkship medical student at St Paul
 
04:24:51.469 --> 04:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
Ramsey Hospital in St Paul Minnesota we
 
04:24:54.349 --> 04:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
admitted a young woman with severe
 
04:24:59.590 --> 04:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
hypotension fever and chills and vaginal
 
04:25:03.429 --> 04:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
bleeding clearly she was in septic shock
 
04:25:06.070 --> 04:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
and confessed to having had an illegal
 
04:25:07.990 --> 04:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
abortion the week
 
04:25:10.990 --> 04:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
before we gave her IV fluids and the
 
04:25:13.710 --> 04:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
best antibiotics we had at the time and
 
04:25:15.590 --> 04:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
then took her to the operating room to
 
04:25:19.480 --> 04:25:19.490 align:start position:0%
remove her perforated infected
 
04:25:19.490 --> 04:25:21.349 align:start position:0%

04:25:33.189 --> 04:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
team I asked her if she had informed her
 
04:25:36.030 --> 04:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
parents that she was pregnant and she
 
04:25:39.830 --> 04:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
confided that her father was responsible
 
04:25:42.510 --> 04:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
for her pregnancy
 
04:25:45.070 --> 04:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
and she'd rather die than tell her mom
 
04:25:46.189 --> 04:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
that she was
 
04:25:50.429 --> 04:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
pregnant unfortunately she did die a few
 
04:25:50.439 --> 04:25:52.309 align:start position:0%
pregnant unfortunately she did die a few
days

04:25:52.309 --> 04:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
days
 
04:25:54.910 --> 04:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
later I would tell my medical students
 
04:25:57.630 --> 04:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
this story as part of a history of
 
04:26:02.910 --> 04:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
medicine history of our Oban specialty I
 
04:26:05.109 --> 04:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
explained that they would likely never
 
04:26:08.030 --> 04:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
see a young woman with a septic abortion
 
04:26:09.670 --> 04:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
because of Ro
 
04:26:12.870 --> 04:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
vade in 1973
 
04:26:15.269 --> 04:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
making certain that
 
04:26:17.790 --> 04:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
women were
 
04:26:21.710 --> 04:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
free to have access to Legal safe
 
04:26:23.469 --> 04:26:23.479 align:start position:0%
terminations of
 
04:26:26.510 --> 04:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
pregnancy unlike my older Partners who
 
04:26:28.550 --> 04:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
trained in New York City during the
 
04:26:31.990 --> 04:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
1950s they would never have to watch
 
04:26:36.269 --> 04:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
women die of illegal unsterile abortions
 
04:26:39.990 --> 04:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
leaving often orphans at home I
 
04:26:42.229 --> 04:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
emphasize that our country was not
 
04:26:44.670 --> 04:26:44.680 align:start position:0%
contributing to the estimated
 
04:26:49.189 --> 04:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
22 million unsafe abortions
 
04:26:51.630 --> 04:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
annually in countries where there was
 
04:26:54.349 --> 04:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
limited access to Safe abortion
 
04:26:57.429 --> 04:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
resulting in tens of thousands of deaths
 
04:26:57.439 --> 04:26:59.030 align:start position:0%
resulting in tens of thousands of deaths
and

04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:01.389 --> 04:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
disabilities little did I know that
 
04:27:05.030 --> 04:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
politics would creep into the US Supreme
 
04:27:08.590 --> 04:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
Court pick it stop v Wade please stop
 
04:27:10.990 --> 04:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
wrapping would be reversed almost done
 
04:27:13.630 --> 04:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
abortion is not about politics it's
 
04:27:17.070 --> 04:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
about safe Health Care for Women for
 
04:27:18.830 --> 04:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
women the decision to terminate a
 
04:27:21.429 --> 04:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is difficult and deeply
 
04:27:23.950 --> 04:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
personal a matter that should only be
 
04:27:28.189 --> 04:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
decided in private between a physician
 
04:27:31.950 --> 04:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
or caregiver and the woman lawmakers who
 
04:27:34.269 --> 04:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
know nothing about practicing medicine
 
04:27:36.109 --> 04:27:36.119 align:start position:0%
or caring for
 
04:27:39.070 --> 04:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
women should be making this decision for
 
04:27:41.870 --> 04:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
her legislators who know nothing about a
 
04:27:44.269 --> 04:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
woman situation in her life should never
 
04:27:46.389 --> 04:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
have a voice in her
 
04:27:49.670 --> 04:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
medical decisions when especially when
 
04:27:53.109 --> 04:27:53.119 align:start position:0%
it comes to pregnancy providing private
 
04:27:55.710 --> 04:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
safe Health Care to women gives them
 
04:27:59.429 --> 04:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
control over their bodies and freedom to
 
04:28:03.389 --> 04:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
make this world a better

2:45 um I am originally from Michigan
 
04:28:49.830 --> 04:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
where our governor and legislature
 
04:28:52.710 --> 04:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
catified abortion into our constitution
 
04:28:54.910 --> 04:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
in response to the Dos
 
04:28:57.630 --> 04:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
decision as a young educated woman who
 
04:28:59.830 --> 04:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
hopes to have a family one day it is a
 
04:29:02.309 --> 04:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
priority for me to live in a state that
 
04:29:04.349 --> 04:29:04.359 align:start position:0%
has access to abortion for whatever
 
04:29:06.990 --> 04:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
reason that may arise Pew research
 
04:29:10.429 --> 04:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
studies in 2024 on a public opinion
 
04:29:13.229 --> 04:29:13.239 align:start position:0%
about abortion has two of Americans and
 
04:29:16.710 --> 04:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
2third of women believing in access to
 
04:29:19.109 --> 04:29:19.119 align:start position:0%
abortion I hope that the legislature and
 
04:29:21.670 --> 04:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
Governor can take this initial step in
 
04:29:23.630 --> 04:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
this resolution to affirm the access to
 
04:29:25.910 --> 04:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Care to ensure the
 
04:29:28.469 --> 04:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
health safety and prosperity of women in
 
04:29:30.550 --> 04:29:30.560 align:start position:0%

04:30:05.269 --> 04:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
besides voting so I'm nervous
 
04:30:07.189 --> 04:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
and we have a question I'll keep it as
 
04:30:08.790 --> 04:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
short as possible so I don't screw up
 
04:30:10.309 --> 04:30:10.319 align:start position:0%

04:30:13.469 --> 04:30:13.479 align:start position:0%
counter your last name k
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
yes my name is Greg kungle okay I am uh
 
04:30:19.229 --> 04:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
I head up abolish abortion New Hampshire
 
04:30:24.030 --> 04:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to oppose HR HCR 7 um I am
 
04:30:26.149 --> 04:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
coming from an abolitionist uh
 
04:30:29.750 --> 04:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
standpoint where um what we want to do
 
04:30:32.070 --> 04:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
is we are committed to the uh total
 
04:30:34.510 --> 04:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
equivocal and un and immediate abolition
 
04:30:36.990 --> 04:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
of abortion in the state of New Hamshire
 
04:30:39.349 --> 04:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
and so I've been listening a little bit
 
04:30:42.550 --> 04:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
to this and
 
04:30:44.790 --> 04:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
you know it's just kind of I I I'm a
 
04:30:46.790 --> 04:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
little bit confused because well first
 
04:30:48.830 --> 04:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
of all we're talking we're talking about
 
04:30:51.429 --> 04:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
uh abortion and Health Care like there's
 
04:30:53.750 --> 04:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
one person involved but there are two
 
04:30:55.309 --> 04:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a pregnant woman and
 
04:30:57.030 --> 04:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
when we Define pregnancy I looked it up
 
04:30:59.870 --> 04:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
on on the way in Miriam Webster defines
 
04:31:02.189 --> 04:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is of a
 
04:31:04.990 --> 04:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
woman having the condition of carrying
 
04:31:07.070 --> 04:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
an unborn Offspring so there's a second
 
04:31:09.070 --> 04:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
person involved in this and and we're
 
04:31:10.429 --> 04:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
just totally ignoring that person's
 
04:31:10.439 --> 04:31:12.510 align:start position:0%
just totally ignoring that person's
standpoint

04:31:12.510 --> 04:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
04:31:14.750 --> 04:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
so I think that's important to consider
 
04:31:17.070 --> 04:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
and not lose sight of and I think it's
 
04:31:21.429 --> 04:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
IM immoral to purposely lose sight of it
 
04:31:23.670 --> 04:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about abortion
 
04:31:25.269 --> 04:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
Healthcare and abortion like it's the
 
04:31:27.030 --> 04:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
same thing but it's not it's two
 
04:31:29.429 --> 04:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
separate things there's abortion and
 
04:31:31.510 --> 04:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
there's Health Care they are not the
 
04:31:33.870 --> 04:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
same and all this conflating all this
 
04:31:36.670 --> 04:31:36.680 align:start position:0%
all this stuff really has no bear
 
04:31:40.349 --> 04:31:40.359 align:start position:0%
bearing here healthc care is it's two
 
04:31:42.830 --> 04:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
words put together Health and Care
 
04:31:45.149 --> 04:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
it's talking about saving lives and
 
04:31:50.189 --> 04:31:50.199 align:start position:0%
making them well abortion kills a human
 
04:31:53.830 --> 04:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
being Health Care saves there is no
 
04:31:57.229 --> 04:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
version of Health Care that kills a
 
04:31:57.239 --> 04:32:00.030 align:start position:0%
version of Health Care that kills a
human

04:32:00.030 --> 04:32:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:02.990 --> 04:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
being and if you think
 
04:32:06.750 --> 04:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
that's uh untrue of if you think if
 
04:32:08.710 --> 04:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
anybody thinks it's uh Not a Human Being
 
04:32:11.990 --> 04:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about inside the womb then
 
04:32:14.229 --> 04:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
go ahead and take an abortion pill and
 
04:32:16.710 --> 04:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
give it to a pregnant mother who wants
 
04:32:18.990 --> 04:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
to have that child and find out how
 
04:32:21.030 --> 04:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
quickly you are charged with
 
04:32:23.510 --> 04:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
homicide because if if we're talking
 
04:32:24.910 --> 04:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
about we're only talking about the
 
04:32:27.510 --> 04:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
mothers who don't want their children uh
 
04:32:30.070 --> 04:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
here and the mothers that want their
 
04:32:32.710 --> 04:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
children it's it's homicide if if you go
 
04:32:34.950 --> 04:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
and mess with
 
04:32:37.830 --> 04:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
that so what what is abortion then
 
04:32:41.910 --> 04:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
abortion is defined as the ending of of
 
04:32:43.710 --> 04:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
a pregnancy the early ending of a
 
04:32:46.389 --> 04:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
pregnancy that does not result in a live
 
04:32:50.030 --> 04:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
birth so by by definition a pregnant is
 
04:32:52.309 --> 04:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
a human being pregnant pregnancy
 
04:32:53.950 --> 04:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
involves a second human being in the
 
04:32:58.469 --> 04:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
womb and by definition abortion kills
 
04:33:00.469 --> 04:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
04:33:04.189 --> 04:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
Healthcare so I from a abolished
 
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
abortion totally oppose that and
 
04:33:10.150 --> 04:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
furthermore I think that to get right
 
04:33:11.789 --> 04:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
with this to get right with this issue
 
04:33:13.869 --> 04:33:13.879 align:start position:0%
it's not confusing we've made it
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
confusing by 15 we bills 24 we bills
 
04:33:19.629 --> 04:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
where it's wrong to kill babies here but
 
04:33:22.470 --> 04:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
it's okay to kill babies there take our
 
04:33:24.789 --> 04:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
state's existing murder laws and apply
 
04:33:27.429 --> 04:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
them to when life begins at conception
 
04:33:30.429 --> 04:33:30.439 align:start position:0%
which is fertilization thanks thank you
 
04:33:30.439 --> 04:33:31.590 align:start position:0%
which is fertilization thanks thank you
any

04:33:31.590 --> 04:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:33:38.150 --> 04:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:40.830 --> 04:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
sir also signed up to speak is Nancy
 
04:33:40.840 --> 04:33:54.189 align:start position:0%
sir also signed up to speak is Nancy
Brennan

04:33:54.189 --> 04:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:56.470 --> 04:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for taking my
 
04:34:00.949 --> 04:34:00.959 align:start position:0%
testimony Nancy Brennan I'm from we and
 
04:34:03.910 --> 04:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
I would like to read testimony from a
 
04:34:07.390 --> 04:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
friend who couldn't be here I told him I
 
04:34:10.551 --> 04:34:10.561 align:start position:0%
would read his testimony and pass it out
 
04:34:13.949 --> 04:34:13.959 align:start position:0%
he is in support of
 
04:34:18.510 --> 04:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
hc7 our state has arguably the strongest
 
04:34:21.551 --> 04:34:21.561 align:start position:0%
tradition of respect for personal
 
04:34:25.230 --> 04:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
individual privacy of any state when I
 
04:34:27.470 --> 04:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
served in the general court many years
 
04:34:30.390 --> 04:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
ago with only a small handful of
 
04:34:33.789 --> 04:34:33.799 align:start position:0%
exceptions every member of this body
 
04:34:36.750 --> 04:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
upheld the principle as it applied to
 
04:34:39.709 --> 04:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights in general and to
 
04:34:41.349 --> 04:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
the right to choose abortion in
 
04:34:43.750 --> 04:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
particular particular I urge all members
 
04:34:46.629 --> 04:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
of this committee to recognize that any
 
04:34:49.750 --> 04:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
failure to strongly support All rights
 
04:34:53.230 --> 04:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
to personal individual privacy will lead
 
04:34:56.230 --> 04:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
to an erosion of New Hampshire's privacy
 
04:34:59.510 --> 04:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
rights more broadly granted Staters must
 
04:35:02.510 --> 04:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
proudly stand up for the rights of all
 
04:35:05.189 --> 04:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
even those with whom we may strongly
 
04:35:09.189 --> 04:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
disagree if we fail at that ultimately
 
04:35:12.709 --> 04:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
every Citizen's Freedom will be at risk
 
04:35:16.230 --> 04:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
this is a statement from Rob blakney
 
04:35:18.670 --> 04:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
here in conquer and I will give you
 
04:35:22.029 --> 04:35:22.039 align:start position:0%
those I would just like to add that as a
 
04:35:27.750 --> 04:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
76y old woman who lived through times
 
04:35:32.189 --> 04:35:32.199 align:start position:0%
before row I knew of people who went
 
04:35:32.199 --> 04:35:33.269 align:start position:0%
before row I knew of people who went
through

04:35:33.269 --> 04:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:35:36.269 --> 04:35:36.279 align:start position:0%
things I don't know of anybody that died
 
04:35:38.789 --> 04:35:38.799 align:start position:0%
my mother did but there were people my
 
04:35:41.709 --> 04:35:41.719 align:start position:0%
age who could never have children and
 
04:35:45.189 --> 04:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
after they had abortions that were
 
04:35:47.830 --> 04:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
unsafe and I will
 
04:35:51.910 --> 04:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
say I am in favor of this I wish it was
 
04:35:57.670 --> 04:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:00.390 --> 04:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
constitution there will always be
 
04:36:05.269 --> 04:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
abortions and if we pass bills to stop
 
04:36:09.230 --> 04:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
abortion then women of privilege will
 
04:36:12.830 --> 04:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
still be able to get the
 
04:36:16.070 --> 04:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the people who will suffer will be
 
04:36:19.830 --> 04:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
the people who can handle it the least
 
04:36:19.840 --> 04:36:20.750 align:start position:0%
the people who can handle it the least
thank

04:36:20.750 --> 04:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:36:24.510 --> 04:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you any
 
04:36:29.070 --> 04:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:53.269 --> 04:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:55.990 --> 04:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
hi hi my name is Beth scare and I'm a
 
04:36:58.789 --> 04:36:58.799 align:start position:0%
grandmother from Nashua I am here today
 
04:37:01.150 --> 04:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
to speak in opposition to
 
04:37:04.390 --> 04:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
hc7 um I'll read a quote from Federica
 
04:37:06.390 --> 04:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
Matthew Matthews Green which I'll send
 
04:37:09.269 --> 04:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
to you later the problem is that it's a
 
04:37:11.990 --> 04:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
baby winds up in deadlock with it's a
 
04:37:14.789 --> 04:37:14.799 align:start position:0%
woman's right the two statements do not
 
04:37:17.390 --> 04:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
refute each other so no resolution is
 
04:37:19.789 --> 04:37:19.799 align:start position:0%
possible what's more they continue a
 
04:37:22.510 --> 04:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
pernicious fallacy that dead that deadly
 
04:37:25.349 --> 04:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
conflict between women and children is a
 
04:37:26.910 --> 04:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
normal State of
 
04:37:29.629 --> 04:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
Affairs in no sane country are women and
 
04:37:32.230 --> 04:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
their own children assumed to be mortal
 
04:37:34.830 --> 04:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
enemies any culture that does so is
 
04:37:36.949 --> 04:37:36.959 align:start position:0%
slowly committing
 
04:37:39.349 --> 04:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
suicide when we accept as normal The
 
04:37:40.949 --> 04:37:40.959 align:start position:0%
Ripping of a child from her mother's
 
04:37:40.959 --> 04:37:42.029 align:start position:0%
Ripping of a child from her mother's
womb

04:37:42.029 --> 04:37:42.039 align:start position:0%
womb
 
04:37:44.230 --> 04:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
we violate something disturbingly close
 
04:37:47.070 --> 04:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
to the heart of the human story in the
 
04:37:49.029 --> 04:37:49.039 align:start position:0%
land where women kill their unborn
 
04:37:51.789 --> 04:37:51.799 align:start position:0%
children every lesser love grows
 
04:37:56.830 --> 04:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:00.551 --> 04:38:00.561 align:start position:0%
hc7 thank you any

04:38:26.990 --> 04:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
members of the House house Health Human
 
04:38:29.230 --> 04:38:29.240 align:start position:0%

Equity now to speak in support of HCR 7
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
reproductive Equity now works uh across
 
04:38:41.830 --> 04:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
New England to make Equitable access to
 
04:38:43.390 --> 04:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
the full spectrum of reproductive
 
04:38:46.470 --> 04:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
Healthcare reality for our PE all people
 
04:38:48.949 --> 04:38:48.959 align:start position:0%
um as we've discussed uh this afternoon
 
04:38:50.990 --> 04:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
as New Hampshire is the only state in
 
04:38:53.189 --> 04:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
New England without affirmative legal
 
04:38:55.551 --> 04:38:55.561 align:start position:0%
protections for abortion either in its
 
04:38:58.230 --> 04:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
statute or in its Constitution Granite
 
04:39:01.310 --> 04:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
Staters are not impervious or immune to
 
04:39:03.029 --> 04:39:03.039 align:start position:0%
the threats to abortion care that we are
 
04:39:05.429 --> 04:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
seeing from States across the country
 
04:39:07.551 --> 04:39:07.561 align:start position:0%
and to the threats that we expect to see
 
04:39:09.869 --> 04:39:09.879 align:start position:0%
coming from the national level these
 
04:39:13.269 --> 04:39:13.279 align:start position:0%
threats and the patch work of uh laws
 
04:39:15.551 --> 04:39:15.561 align:start position:0%
governing access to abortion care
 
04:39:18.869 --> 04:39:18.879 align:start position:0%
Nationwide results in chaos in confusion
 
04:39:21.670 --> 04:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
and harm for real people in real
 
04:39:23.830 --> 04:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
communities including your constituents
 
04:39:26.189 --> 04:39:26.199 align:start position:0%
who need access to basic and Essential
 
04:39:28.269 --> 04:39:28.279 align:start position:0%
Health Care that gives them the freedom
 
04:39:30.470 --> 04:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
to make their own decisions and to fully
 
04:39:33.670 --> 04:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
control their bodies lives and Futures
 
04:39:35.789 --> 04:39:35.799 align:start position:0%
this is why we are urging you today to
 
04:39:39.868 --> 04:39:39.878 align:start position:0%
act favorably on HCR 7 a resolution that
 
04:39:43.030 --> 04:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
will clearly and simply communicate to
 
04:39:44.590 --> 04:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire that abortion
 
04:39:46.550 --> 04:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
is Healthcare that abortion is a
 
04:39:48.788 --> 04:39:48.798 align:start position:0%
critical component of comprehensive
 
04:39:51.110 --> 04:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
reproductive healthare and that it is
 
04:39:53.430 --> 04:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
the policy position of this body that an
 
04:39:54.990 --> 04:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
individual's right to terminate their
 
04:39:58.310 --> 04:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
own pregnancy prior to 24 weeks and
 
04:40:00.350 --> 04:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
control their own future will not be
 
04:40:03.390 --> 04:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
denied across the country as I've noted
 
04:40:06.310 --> 04:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
chaos and confusion abounds with regard
 
04:40:08.788 --> 04:40:08.798 align:start position:0%
to understanding the legality and
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
accessibility of abortion care um
 
04:40:13.830 --> 04:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
polling for example shows that over half
 
04:40:16.110 --> 04:40:16.120 align:start position:0%
of All American women are unsure about
 
04:40:18.070 --> 04:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
the legality of medication abortion in
 
04:40:22.070 --> 04:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
their state HCR 7 offers an opportunity
 
04:40:23.788 --> 04:40:23.798 align:start position:0%
to combat this
 
04:40:26.628 --> 04:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
misinformation um and confusion and to
 
04:40:28.270 --> 04:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
cut through the noise and help Granite
 
04:40:30.070 --> 04:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
Staters in particular cut through the
 
04:40:32.670 --> 04:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
noise with a simple message that
 
04:40:34.910 --> 04:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
abortion as I've said is a critical
 
04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
component of reproductive health care
 
04:40:38.990 --> 04:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
and that our state government will not
 
04:40:42.190 --> 04:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
infringe upon or deny this right to care
 
04:40:44.750 --> 04:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters overwhelmingly support
 
04:40:46.750 --> 04:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedom and believe that
 
04:40:48.430 --> 04:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
there should be a right to abortion in
 
04:40:51.110 --> 04:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
every state across the country and so
 
04:40:53.430 --> 04:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
after dos handed the fight for abortion
 
04:40:56.708 --> 04:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
access back to state governments HCR 7
 
04:40:58.590 --> 04:40:58.600 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire's opportunity this
 
04:41:01.670 --> 04:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
session to take this positive action
 
04:41:03.430 --> 04:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
affirming reproductive Freedom that
 
04:41:06.350 --> 04:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters are looking for um I'll
 
04:41:08.590 --> 04:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
finally close with with uh with noting
 
04:41:11.390 --> 04:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
that advancing hr7 aligns very closely
 
04:41:12.868 --> 04:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire's very long-standing
 
04:41:15.030 --> 04:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
history and Legacy of affirming personal
 
04:41:17.350 --> 04:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
freedoms and we urge you to support the
 
04:41:20.788 --> 04:41:20.798 align:start position:0%
resolution thank you so much thank you
 
04:41:20.798 --> 04:41:22.670 align:start position:0%
resolution thank you so much thank you

any
 
04:41:28.830 --> 04:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:31.628 --> 04:41:31.638 align:start position:0%
thanks also signed up to speak is Liz

04:41:46.430 --> 04:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon thank you
 
04:41:48.190 --> 04:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the House Health
 
04:41:49.750 --> 04:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
Human Services and elderly Affairs
 
04:41:51.990 --> 04:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Liz Canada I'm
 
04:41:53.590 --> 04:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
the advocacy director for Planned
 
04:41:54.990 --> 04:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
Parenthood of Northern New England and
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood New Hampshire action
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
fund and we are in strong support of HCR
 
04:42:02.390 --> 04:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
7 when the US Supreme Court overturned
 
04:42:04.270 --> 04:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
roie Wade in June of
 
04:42:07.470 --> 04:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
2022 they took away the federal right to
 
04:42:11.190 --> 04:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
abortion and since then as of today 19
 
04:42:13.470 --> 04:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
states have banned abortion or severely
 
04:42:15.948 --> 04:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
restricted abortion and that number has
 
04:42:17.628 --> 04:42:17.638 align:start position:0%
changed because of court cases and
 
04:42:19.030 --> 04:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
because some states have amended their
 
04:42:21.030 --> 04:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
constitutions but the bottom line is
 
04:42:23.628 --> 04:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
that other states have taken action to
 
04:42:27.150 --> 04:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
further restrict abortion New Hampshire
 
04:42:28.948 --> 04:42:28.958 align:start position:0%
as we just heard as well New Hampshire
 
04:42:30.430 --> 04:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
is the only state in New England that
 
04:42:33.868 --> 04:42:33.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any state law or uh state
 
04:42:35.910 --> 04:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
constitution protections explicitly
 
04:42:38.390 --> 04:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
listed and I heard representative marle
 
04:42:41.350 --> 04:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
you mentioned earlier the statute about
 
04:42:44.708 --> 04:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
um after 24 weeks and just want to
 
04:42:48.868 --> 04:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
clarify that part of that same law is
 
04:42:51.550 --> 04:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
that there is no I believe it's 329
 
04:42:54.510 --> 04:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
colon 49 there is no right to abortion
 
04:42:57.150 --> 04:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
it it says that a few lines later and so
 
04:42:59.550 --> 04:42:59.560 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we are clear
 
04:43:01.670 --> 04:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
that in New Hampshire we don't have
 
04:43:04.350 --> 04:43:04.360 align:start position:0%
protections we don't have any um
 
04:43:04.360 --> 04:43:06.310 align:start position:0%
protections we don't have any um
statutory

04:43:06.310 --> 04:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
04:43:08.350 --> 04:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
guarantees in the
 
04:43:10.750 --> 04:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
fall there was a survey that went out
 
04:43:12.430 --> 04:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
that show showed
 
04:43:15.830 --> 04:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
64% of granite Staters want their state
 
04:43:19.150 --> 04:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
lawmakers to take positive proactive
 
04:43:23.910 --> 04:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
action on abortion rights and so HCR 7
 
04:43:26.350 --> 04:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
before you this resolution does just
 
04:43:29.510 --> 04:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
that it shows that there is uh the
 
04:43:32.350 --> 04:43:32.360 align:start position:0%
position of the chamber that you will
 
04:43:34.708 --> 04:43:34.718 align:start position:0%
not further restrict abortion from what
 
04:43:37.070 --> 04:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
is already on the
 
04:43:39.990 --> 04:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
books voting against harmful legislation
 
04:43:42.708 --> 04:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
um I believe it was two weeks ago uh the
 
04:43:44.750 --> 04:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
house voted to withdraw the 15we
 
04:43:46.590 --> 04:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
abortion ban which was which was great
 
04:43:48.270 --> 04:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
we're in strong support of that action
 
04:43:52.110 --> 04:43:52.120 align:start position:0%
as well but voting against harmful bills
 
04:43:54.590 --> 04:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
is one step in that process the other is
 
04:43:56.910 --> 04:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
taking a positive action and that's what
 
04:44:01.230 --> 04:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
this resolution does it simply shows
 
04:44:04.390 --> 04:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
constituents that you will not further
 
04:44:06.310 --> 04:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
restrict abortion from what's already
 
04:44:08.430 --> 04:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
there and that's why the 24 weeks is in
 
04:44:11.948 --> 04:44:11.958 align:start position:0%
the resolution I believe um and it is a
 
04:44:13.910 --> 04:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
clear position that only you as
 
04:44:16.390 --> 04:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
lawmakers can take there were a lot of
 
04:44:19.350 --> 04:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
elected officials who ran uh and talked
 
04:44:21.270 --> 04:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
in their campaigns about not wanting to
 
04:44:22.948 --> 04:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
further restrict abortion and that's
 
04:44:24.948 --> 04:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
what this resolution says it allows you
 
04:44:27.430 --> 04:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
to take that action and show that
 
04:44:29.788 --> 04:44:29.798 align:start position:0%
commitment explicitly through that vote
 
04:44:31.788 --> 04:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
so we would urge you to vote ought to
 
04:44:37.510 --> 04:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
pass on HCR 7 thank you thank you any
 
04:44:39.708 --> 04:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
04:44:47.750 --> 04:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:59.270 --> 04:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:02.030 --> 04:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
SK good afternoon chairman mcdal and
 
04:45:04.590 --> 04:45:04.600 align:start position:0%
distinguished members of the
 
04:45:07.750 --> 04:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
committee I urge you to vote against
 
04:45:09.628 --> 04:45:09.638 align:start position:0%
this res this
 
04:45:11.350 --> 04:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
resolution I believe believe in
 
04:45:13.430 --> 04:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
protecting human life since birth having
 
04:45:16.270 --> 04:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
said that I understand that this does
 
04:45:18.550 --> 04:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
affect autonomy and I respect those of
 
04:45:21.948 --> 04:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
you who see your job as to balance human
 
04:45:24.310 --> 04:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
life versus female
 
04:45:27.550 --> 04:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
autonomy this resolution gives only one
 
04:45:30.150 --> 04:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
side it takes the extreme position and
 
04:45:34.230 --> 04:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
teaches that human life has no inherent
 
04:45:37.788 --> 04:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
value for the first 24
 
04:45:41.230 --> 04:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
weeks and the calls for autonomy in this
 
04:45:43.910 --> 04:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
bill assume that it's only the woman
 
04:45:45.628 --> 04:45:45.638 align:start position:0%
who's making the decision about the
 
04:45:47.788 --> 04:45:47.798 align:start position:0%
abortion it's very naive to think that
 
04:45:51.390 --> 04:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
abortions all happen without coercion
 
04:45:53.788 --> 04:45:53.798 align:start position:0%
one Salient example was with this the
 
04:45:56.708 --> 04:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
Scandal at this s new center one of the
 
04:45:59.190 --> 04:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
counselors impregnated one of the girls
 
04:46:02.070 --> 04:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
who is there and then took the child for
 
04:46:04.390 --> 04:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
an abortion to cover that up we don't
 
04:46:06.470 --> 04:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
know how many groomers or people
 
04:46:08.670 --> 04:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
prostituting young people are using this
 
04:46:11.470 --> 04:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
to cover up it's not just a young
 
04:46:11.480 --> 04:46:12.990 align:start position:0%
to cover up it's not just a young
woman's

04:46:12.990 --> 04:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
woman's
 
04:46:16.310 --> 04:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
Choice I'm also wondering if there's any
 
04:46:19.230 --> 04:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
pro-life medical professionals that
 
04:46:21.550 --> 04:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
avoid areas where they might feel
 
04:46:24.430 --> 04:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
compelled to perform abortions and
 
04:46:26.430 --> 04:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
that's something that we I I haven't
 
04:46:28.270 --> 04:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
heard anyone look at or
 
04:46:31.030 --> 04:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
study when someone says something is
 
04:46:33.868 --> 04:46:33.878 align:start position:0%
science shows or is not in dispute then
 
04:46:35.788 --> 04:46:35.798 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty good idea to check on that
 
04:46:37.510 --> 04:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
and dispute it right away to make sure
 
04:46:40.548 --> 04:46:40.558 align:start position:0%
it's right there to what degree there's
 
04:46:43.590 --> 04:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
a correlation between um abortion
 
04:46:45.470 --> 04:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
restrictions and increased abortions and
 
04:46:47.590 --> 04:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
just looking quickly here they're
 
04:46:50.030 --> 04:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
counting um things incidents that really
 
04:46:51.990 --> 04:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
have nothing to do with with abortion
 
04:46:54.070 --> 04:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
laws and there's also a concern that
 
04:46:57.270 --> 04:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
these abortion um pills the medications
 
04:46:59.110 --> 04:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
that people are taking they didn't go
 
04:47:01.150 --> 04:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
through any serious clinical trials and
 
04:47:02.948 --> 04:47:02.958 align:start position:0%
how how dangerous are they no one's
 
04:47:05.150 --> 04:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
keeping track of how many are are
 
04:47:09.590 --> 04:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
affected there this is a statement that
 
04:47:12.110 --> 04:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
I really don't want New Hampshire to
 
04:47:15.070 --> 04:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
make let's let's at least acknowledge
 
04:47:18.310 --> 04:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
that many of us feel that life begins at
 
04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
conception like science does tell us and
 
04:47:24.270 --> 04:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
deserves to be acknowledged thank
 
04:47:27.470 --> 04:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you any
 
04:47:34.750 --> 04:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:37.470 --> 04:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak as Courtney
 
04:47:47.910 --> 04:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:50.030 --> 04:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
hi good afternoon chair McDonald and
 
04:47:52.390 --> 04:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:47:54.310 --> 04:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
my name is Courtney Reid I serve as
 
04:47:56.948 --> 04:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
policy Advocate with the ACLU of New
 
04:47:59.510 --> 04:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I am speaking on behalf of
 
04:48:03.990 --> 04:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
the organization in support of HCR 7 uh
 
04:48:07.230 --> 04:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
to keep things brief HCR 7 would send a
 
04:48:09.310 --> 04:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
strong message that in the Live Free or
 
04:48:12.590 --> 04:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
Die State there's no room for attacks
 
04:48:15.190 --> 04:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
against bodily autonomy and the right to
 
04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
make private healthcare decisions HCR 7
 
04:48:21.750 --> 04:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
also sends message that the legislature
 
04:48:23.750 --> 04:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
understands the importance of the
 
04:48:26.470 --> 04:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
physician patient relationship and as
 
04:48:28.830 --> 04:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
expressly stated in the resolution that
 
04:48:31.310 --> 04:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
an abortion is a critical component of
 
04:48:34.030 --> 04:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
reproductive health care and to level
 
04:48:36.590 --> 04:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
set abortion is a human right and this
 
04:48:38.868 --> 04:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
right has been recognized by numerous
 
04:48:41.708 --> 04:48:41.718 align:start position:0%
medical associations and as we've heard
 
04:48:43.150 --> 04:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
from previous hearings and other
 
04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
speakers that in the wake of bans and
 
04:48:47.390 --> 04:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
restrictions that have happened after
 
04:48:50.470 --> 04:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
dos across the country now is time to
 
04:48:53.190 --> 04:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
take a stand to protect this right again
 
04:48:55.310 --> 04:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the only state in New
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
England that does not have an
 
04:48:59.350 --> 04:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
affirmative protection for abortion in
 
04:49:04.390 --> 04:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
its laws and uh just some data after
 
04:49:06.470 --> 04:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
that Fallout as to why it's so important
 
04:49:09.230 --> 04:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to take action now
 
04:49:11.310 --> 04:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
uh in 2022
 
04:49:14.390 --> 04:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
after row was overturned at least 25
 
04:49:16.910 --> 04:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
million women lost access to an abortion
 
04:49:20.868 --> 04:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
in their home state HCR 7 offers an
 
04:49:23.230 --> 04:49:23.240 align:start position:0%
excellent opportunity for lawmakers to
 
04:49:25.070 --> 04:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
affirm their commitment to protecting
 
04:49:28.430 --> 04:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedom and oppose further
 
04:49:30.350 --> 04:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
restrictions and barriers to abortion
 
04:49:31.470 --> 04:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
amidst these
 
04:49:35.230 --> 04:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
attacks uh going further we know that
 
04:49:39.110 --> 04:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
research finds that when uh access to an
 
04:49:41.628 --> 04:49:41.638 align:start position:0%
abortion is restricted uh we see higher
 
04:49:44.910 --> 04:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
rates of maternal mortality uh increased
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
poverty people are more likely to stay
 
04:49:49.070 --> 04:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
in abusive
 
04:49:51.948 --> 04:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
relationships and there's a widening of
 
04:49:51.958 --> 04:49:53.628 align:start position:0%
relationships and there's a widening of
socioeconomic

04:49:53.628 --> 04:49:53.638 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic
 
04:49:56.070 --> 04:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
inequalities we've also seen in polling
 
04:49:57.990 --> 04:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
at the national level and in New
 
04:50:01.230 --> 04:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that a majority of Voters
 
04:50:03.310 --> 04:50:03.320 align:start position:0%
support access to safe and legal
 
04:50:05.990 --> 04:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
abortion so it's time for the legislator
 
04:50:08.548 --> 04:50:08.558 align:start position:0%
legislature to recognize that by voting
 
04:50:11.548 --> 04:50:11.558 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill uh I'm happy to
 
04:50:13.628 --> 04:50:13.638 align:start position:0%

04:50:56.910 --> 04:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
the responses
 
04:51:00.548 --> 04:51:00.558 align:start position:0%
from the federal aspects of this
 
04:51:04.070 --> 04:51:04.080 align:start position:0%

you so much for your question
 
04:51:11.190 --> 04:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative sure I Ely I think I
 
04:51:12.990 --> 04:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
would defer to the sponsors of the bill
 
04:51:14.788 --> 04:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
to more appropriately answer that
 
04:51:19.788 --> 04:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
question uh but to just ground in this I
 
04:51:21.830 --> 04:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
just want to express that this is a
 
04:51:23.590 --> 04:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
policy statement and I think that the
 
04:51:26.030 --> 04:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
policy statement that uh we want to
 
04:51:27.708 --> 04:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
affirm that abortion is a critical
 
04:51:28.990 --> 04:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
component of healthcare that in the
 
04:51:31.510 --> 04:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
granite state we don't want to see any
 
04:51:33.190 --> 04:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
more attacks or restrictions on this
 
04:51:35.230 --> 04:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
bill uh is something that is meant to be
 
04:51:35.240 --> 04:51:36.990 align:start position:0%
bill uh is something that is meant to be
transmitted

04:51:36.990 --> 04:51:37.000 align:start position:0%

04:51:40.868 --> 04:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
broadly thank you representative palazov
 
04:51:43.910 --> 04:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:51:47.948 --> 04:51:47.958 align:start position:0%
my question so uh this bill is written
 
04:51:52.190 --> 04:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
refers to specific policy by President
 
04:51:55.708 --> 04:51:55.718 align:start position:0%
Trump so so I wonder do you know if New
 
04:52:00.390 --> 04:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has any other law that uh
 
04:52:04.110 --> 04:52:04.120 align:start position:0%
specifically uh lists uh president Trump
 
04:52:09.190 --> 04:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:11.628 --> 04:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
otherwise thank you for your question
 
04:52:13.830 --> 04:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh I haven't seen
 
04:52:16.948 --> 04:52:16.958 align:start position:0%
anything in statute but uh I am familiar
 
04:52:19.030 --> 04:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
with a few resolutions and other
 
04:52:21.350 --> 04:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
proposed bills that have cited the
 
04:52:23.270 --> 04:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
current uh in evolving landscape at the
 
04:52:25.190 --> 04:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
national level which I think is part of
 
04:52:27.830 --> 04:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
the reason why this resolution feels so
 
04:52:29.750 --> 04:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
important right now as there's just so
 
04:52:32.548 --> 04:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
much uncertainty about the stability of
 
04:52:35.310 --> 04:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
care in the granite
 
04:52:39.150 --> 04:52:39.160 align:start position:0%

my question just because you are the
 
04:52:49.548 --> 04:52:49.558 align:start position:0%
representative of the ACLU I my question
 
04:52:52.708 --> 04:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
might be a little offc Center does the
 
04:52:56.110 --> 04:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
ACLU believe that abortion should or
 
04:52:58.548 --> 04:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
could be used as birth control and do
 
04:53:00.948 --> 04:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
you consider that
 
04:53:03.788 --> 04:53:03.798 align:start position:0%
healthare thank you for your question
 
04:53:07.030 --> 04:53:07.040 align:start position:0%

04:53:09.910 --> 04:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
that question is not rooted in the facts
 
04:53:11.628 --> 04:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
of what reproductive Healthcare looks
 
04:53:14.310 --> 04:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
like and I would defer to someone from

04:53:17.830 --> 04:53:17.840 align:start position:0%

04:55:55.670 --> 04:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:55:59.310 --> 04:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so our existing
 
04:56:02.628 --> 04:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
abortion law was passed in
 
04:56:05.708 --> 04:56:05.718 align:start position:0%
2021 one year before the do's decision
 
04:56:11.910 --> 04:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
came down so if row was suddenly to be
 
04:56:14.230 --> 04:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
reinstated nothing happens with respect
 
04:56:17.750 --> 04:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
to our law because our law is completely
 
04:56:22.270 --> 04:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
compliant with row um and so what I'm
 
04:56:25.310 --> 04:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
trying to understand and and I I think
 
04:56:25.320 --> 04:56:26.830 align:start position:0%
trying to understand and and I I think
is

04:56:26.830 --> 04:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:56:30.628 --> 04:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
just with you with the medical society
 
04:56:34.510 --> 04:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
um if this law was to
 
04:56:36.868 --> 04:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
pass what would you what would you do
 
04:56:39.110 --> 04:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
with it h how would you take action on
 
04:56:43.350 --> 04:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
it um how how would it benefit you
 
04:56:45.910 --> 04:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
because we have a law that is fully
 
04:56:48.830 --> 04:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
compliant with row I I'm just trying to
 
04:56:51.390 --> 04:56:51.400 align:start position:0%
understand tangibly what you will do if
 
04:56:52.590 --> 04:56:52.600 align:start position:0%
this were to
 
04:56:55.868 --> 04:56:55.878 align:start position:0%
become uh to pass thank
 
04:56:58.708 --> 04:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
you it's my understanding this is a
 
04:57:01.788 --> 04:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
resolution um and that it's an important
 
04:57:02.948 --> 04:57:02.958 align:start position:0%
form of
 
04:57:05.628 --> 04:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
communication um that says to patients
 
04:57:08.470 --> 04:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
what they have available to them for
 
04:57:12.510 --> 04:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
care and um that says to Physicians that
 
04:57:14.390 --> 04:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
that they have the support of the state
 
04:57:18.628 --> 04:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
to provide this Medical Care
 
04:57:23.990 --> 04:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
followup so if this was to pass would
 
04:57:25.910 --> 04:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
would it would it go into official
 
04:57:28.110 --> 04:57:28.120 align:start position:0%
Communications that you send out to your
 
04:57:30.430 --> 04:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
your membership that you share with your
 
04:57:32.990 --> 04:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
patients or is it and I'm trying to
 
04:57:34.628 --> 04:57:34.638 align:start position:0%
understand how it's going to be tangibly
 
04:57:37.470 --> 04:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
used it's one thing to say nous it's
 
04:57:39.670 --> 04:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
people deal with the law They Don't
 
04:57:41.590 --> 04:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
Really deal deal with resolutions so I'm
 
04:57:43.910 --> 04:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
just trying to you know because it's a
 
04:57:46.990 --> 04:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
very divisive issue and we're coming in
 
04:57:49.310 --> 04:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
and and you know we're taking a stand
 
04:57:53.070 --> 04:57:53.080 align:start position:0%
when we when we went with the fetal life
 
04:57:55.708 --> 04:57:55.718 align:start position:0%
Protection Law it was a compromise
 
04:57:57.628 --> 04:57:57.638 align:start position:0%
understanding that there's this huge
 
04:58:01.270 --> 04:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
diversity of opinion with this issue and
 
04:58:03.868 --> 04:58:03.878 align:start position:0%
so we're we're going in and we're
 
04:58:06.070 --> 04:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
muddying things up a little bit and I
 
04:58:08.868 --> 04:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
just kind of want to understand tangibly
 
04:58:11.708 --> 04:58:11.718 align:start position:0%
before I go in and and kind of stir
 
04:58:14.350 --> 04:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
things up how is it going to be used how
 
04:58:16.390 --> 04:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
is it going to benefit how are you going
 
04:58:18.590 --> 04:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
to put it out there and I'm still kind
 
04:58:20.628 --> 04:58:20.638 align:start position:0%
of struggling to see what is the
 
04:58:24.948 --> 04:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:27.868 --> 04:58:27.878 align:start position:0%
you I can't speak to other groups I can
 
04:58:29.948 --> 04:58:29.958 align:start position:0%
speak to you know the association I
 
04:58:33.548 --> 04:58:33.558 align:start position:0%
think that this is again a support for
 
04:58:36.270 --> 04:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
the physician patient relationship um
 
04:58:39.030 --> 04:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
for the autonomy of a woman um for her
 
04:58:40.628 --> 04:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
reproductive health
 
04:58:43.788 --> 04:58:43.798 align:start position:0%
and um you know I again I can't speak to
 
04:58:45.590 --> 04:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
how the Ripple effects that this will
 
04:58:47.708 --> 04:58:47.718 align:start position:0%
have moving forward I can only speak to
 
04:58:51.030 --> 04:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
the importance of supporting
 
04:58:55.910 --> 04:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you any other
 
04:59:03.670 --> 04:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:06.390 --> 04:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Maria
 
04:59:06.400 --> 04:59:13.150 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Maria
Wilkinson

04:59:13.150 --> 04:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:15.430 --> 04:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you chairperson and committee
 
04:59:18.110 --> 04:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
members my name is Maria Wilkinson I was
 
04:59:19.990 --> 04:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
born and raised in conquered New
 
04:59:23.750 --> 04:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and as a granite stator I
 
04:59:26.310 --> 04:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
know how granular we like to get about
 
04:59:29.868 --> 04:59:29.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um law and how focused we
 
04:59:33.070 --> 04:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
like to get into what it means to be
 
04:59:35.270 --> 04:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
living in New Hampshire but I come with
 
04:59:37.310 --> 04:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
a masters in international human rights
 
04:59:39.548 --> 04:59:39.558 align:start position:0%
law and I specialize in the
 
04:59:42.030 --> 04:59:42.040 align:start position:0%
international Covenant on civil and
 
04:59:45.030 --> 04:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
political rights and I support article
 
04:59:47.590 --> 04:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
six the right to life um and at this
 
04:59:49.510 --> 04:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
moment I would like to also say that I
 
04:59:54.868 --> 04:59:54.878 align:start position:0%
support HRC 7 and uh the reason I say
 
04:59:56.910 --> 04:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
that is because with a deep
 
04:59:58.708 --> 04:59:58.718 align:start position:0%
understanding of what international law
 
05:00:03.030 --> 05:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
says about the right to life um it's
 
05:00:07.070 --> 05:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
about um the United Nations human rights
 
05:00:08.868 --> 05:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
committee has never recognized that
 
05:00:11.230 --> 05:00:11.240 align:start position:0%
abortion is included into this right to
 
05:00:14.310 --> 05:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
life it is under um it would be more
 
05:00:16.868 --> 05:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
well recognizing of the women attached
 
05:00:21.430 --> 05:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
to that pregnancy than anything and um I
 
05:00:23.670 --> 05:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
just really want to drive home that
 
05:00:25.310 --> 05:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes we get so singular in our
 
05:00:28.310 --> 05:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
focus and um sometimes the comments we
 
05:00:29.948 --> 05:00:29.958 align:start position:0%
get to opposition of something that's
 
05:00:32.590 --> 05:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
going to um enrich our human rights in
 
05:00:35.948 --> 05:00:35.958 align:start position:0%
the state uh we forget that there is be
 
05:00:39.350 --> 05:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
Beyond us there is greater opinion um
 
05:00:41.030 --> 05:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
and there's I would like to also mention
 
05:00:42.350 --> 05:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
why do we care about the international
 
05:00:43.628 --> 05:00:43.638 align:start position:0%
Covenant on civil and political rights
 
05:00:45.470 --> 05:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that's because the
 
05:00:47.110 --> 05:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
United States has ratified that and
 
05:00:49.310 --> 05:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
therefore um it's our duty under New
 
05:00:50.830 --> 05:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to also recognize what the
 
05:00:53.270 --> 05:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
Covenant says so I don't believe you'll
 
05:00:54.548 --> 05:00:54.558 align:start position:0%
have any questions for me but if you
 
05:00:55.628 --> 05:00:55.638 align:start position:0%
want to ask me a question about
 
05:00:57.470 --> 05:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
international law I will be willing to
 
05:01:00.070 --> 05:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
answer specifically about the right to
 
05:01:02.830 --> 05:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
life any
 
05:01:06.788 --> 05:01:06.798 align:start position:0%
questions okay I'm seeing none thank
 
05:01:09.390 --> 05:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
you no one else has signed up to testify
 
05:01:12.948 --> 05:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
on HC R7 does anyone else wish to
 
05:01:15.150 --> 05:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
testify if not I am going to close the
 
05:01:17.990 --> 05:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HCR 7 those are the
 
05:01:20.628 --> 05:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
only bills that we had uh to schedule
 
05:01:22.510 --> 05:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
for public hearing today so I'm going to
 
05:01:25.310 --> 05:01:25.320 align:start position:0%

05:01:27.110 --> 05:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
do have uh we will be going into
 
05:01:30.430 --> 05:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
executive session in uh perhaps I don't
 
05:01:32.190 --> 05:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
know 10 15 minute recess would be
 
05:01:34.190 --> 05:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate I know at least one party
 
05:01:36.230 --> 05:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
needs to caucus so we're going to be in
 
05:01:39.548 --> 05:01:39.558 align:start position:0%
recess uh for approximately 15 minutes
 
05:01:39.558 --> 05:02:03.868 align:start position:0%

05:29:11.590 --> 05:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
um first B to be considered as HB 73 and
 
05:29:13.910 --> 05:29:13.920 align:start position:0%

05:29:13.920 --> 05:29:15.390 align:start position:0%
representative Drew you headed a motion
I

05:29:15.390 --> 05:29:15.400 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:29:19.910 --> 05:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
believe yes I uh moved to OTP HB 73 okay
 
05:29:21.350 --> 05:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
and I'll second that do you wish to
 
05:29:26.110 --> 05:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion briefly uh HP 73 is
 
05:29:28.510 --> 05:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
some language changes to the statutes uh
 
05:29:29.868 --> 05:29:29.878 align:start position:0%
that in my opinion are frankly long
 
05:29:33.830 --> 05:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
overdue regarding uh reducing harm and
 
05:29:33.840 --> 05:29:35.110 align:start position:0%
overdue regarding uh reducing harm and
um

05:29:35.110 --> 05:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:37.030 --> 05:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
treating activities that the state
 
05:29:38.990 --> 05:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
pursues and with regards to substance
 
05:29:40.548 --> 05:29:40.558 align:start position:0%
misuse uh the way that it should be
 
05:29:43.788 --> 05:29:43.798 align:start position:0%
treated and that's pretty much it okay
 
05:29:46.150 --> 05:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you any other discussion oh yes
 
05:29:48.190 --> 05:29:48.200 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
05:29:50.910 --> 05:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
um as a result of the discussion at the
 
05:29:54.030 --> 05:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
hearing I did actually have
 
05:29:56.510 --> 05:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
prepared um an
 
05:29:58.830 --> 05:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
amendment that would simply amend the
 
05:30:01.070 --> 05:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
bill by replacing Section 8 with the
 
05:30:03.110 --> 05:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
following this act shall take place
 
05:30:06.590 --> 05:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
effect 30 days after passage because the
 
05:30:09.390 --> 05:30:09.400 align:start position:0%
effective date was pushed way out in the
 
05:30:13.750 --> 05:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
original Bill and so it was discussed at
 
05:30:17.670 --> 05:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
the time that the bill came up that uh
 
05:30:19.590 --> 05:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps having it take effect 30 days
 
05:30:22.230 --> 05:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
after Passage would allow for the
 
05:30:24.350 --> 05:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
benefits to go into effect considerably
 
05:30:25.868 --> 05:30:25.878 align:start position:0%
sooner because I think it was pushed out
 
05:30:29.310 --> 05:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
till maybe 2026 or something July 1st
 
05:30:34.030 --> 05:30:34.040 align:start position:0%
2026 yes right so um I I absolutely
 
05:30:36.628 --> 05:30:36.638 align:start position:0%
agree that this is a necessary measure
 
05:30:38.510 --> 05:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
and I would hope that the mment would be
 
05:30:41.350 --> 05:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
seen as a friendly Amendment and if if
 
05:30:43.430 --> 05:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
it would be I will pass it out and offer
 
05:30:46.350 --> 05:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
it sure or somebody else can offer it is
 
05:30:48.310 --> 05:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
there any objection to this
 
05:30:52.510 --> 05:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
U Mr clerk good
 
05:30:54.948 --> 05:30:54.958 align:start position:0%
afternoon that's the only change right
 
05:30:57.310 --> 05:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
that's the only change it's very let me
 
05:30:59.350 --> 05:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
just take one more for
 
05:31:04.510 --> 05:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:06.910 --> 05:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
short it just says this effect shall
 
05:31:09.628 --> 05:31:09.638 align:start position:0%
take 30 amend the bill by replacing
 
05:31:12.430 --> 05:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
Section 8 which is the enacting Clause
 
05:31:14.110 --> 05:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
with the following this act shall take
 
05:31:17.590 --> 05:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:20.548 --> 05:31:20.558 align:start position:0%
passage okay in terms of a friendly
 
05:31:23.190 --> 05:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment um do we don't have to have a
 
05:31:25.230 --> 05:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
formal vote do we or do we we H it's an
 
05:31:28.150 --> 05:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
amendment we have to vote on it yes but
 
05:31:30.430 --> 05:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
I would offer it or I would defer to the
 
05:31:33.548 --> 05:31:33.558 align:start position:0%
cler prer previous two motions removed
 
05:31:36.868 --> 05:31:36.878 align:start position:0%
right um yes uh yes I think so
 
05:31:38.788 --> 05:31:38.798 align:start position:0%
representative D will pull your motion
 
05:31:42.070 --> 05:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
on on the this yes I will withdraw my
 
05:31:43.990 --> 05:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
motion I withdraw my second uh
 
05:31:45.910 --> 05:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative Weber you would like
 
05:31:48.030 --> 05:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
would you like to move this OTP I I
 
05:31:50.670 --> 05:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
would like to move Amendment HB to
 
05:31:53.430 --> 05:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment HB 73 the number of the
 
05:31:55.708 --> 05:31:55.718 align:start position:0%
amendment I am moving is
 
05:31:58.310 --> 05:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
2025 021
 
05:32:01.430 --> 05:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
9h and it simply makes the effective
 
05:32:01.440 --> 05:32:02.990 align:start position:0%
9h and it simply makes the effective
date

05:32:02.990 --> 05:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
date
 
05:32:05.548 --> 05:32:05.558 align:start position:0%
considerably probably a year sooner than
 
05:32:07.628 --> 05:32:07.638 align:start position:0%
it would be if if the bill remained in
 
05:32:11.070 --> 05:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
its original form and uh with or without
 
05:32:12.910 --> 05:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
this I will be supporting the bill but I
 
05:32:15.590 --> 05:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
just thought it would give better effect
 
05:32:19.110 --> 05:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
to the the intent of the bill okay I'll
 
05:32:23.270 --> 05:32:23.280 align:start position:0%

05:32:36.910 --> 05:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
um so I have some concern about this
 
05:32:40.910 --> 05:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
bill and um this amendment making it uh
 
05:32:44.788 --> 05:32:44.798 align:start position:0%
even more uh faster especially in terms
 
05:32:47.628 --> 05:32:47.638 align:start position:0%
of defining it as a reduction of
 
05:32:51.470 --> 05:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
societal and individual harm so my
 
05:32:51.480 --> 05:32:53.070 align:start position:0%
societal and individual harm so my
concerns

05:32:53.070 --> 05:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
05:32:56.070 --> 05:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
about studying how
 
05:33:02.788 --> 05:33:02.798 align:start position:0%
this VI definition can affect uh a scope
 
05:33:06.470 --> 05:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
and a cost of some
 
05:33:12.910 --> 05:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
Services uh provided uh and otherwise so
 
05:33:12.920 --> 05:33:13.750 align:start position:0%
Services uh provided uh and otherwise so
I

I
 
05:33:16.270 --> 05:33:16.280 align:start position:0%
I uh I will
 
05:33:19.110 --> 05:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
probably vote with the rest of committee
 
05:33:24.708 --> 05:33:24.718 align:start position:0%
on the bill but uh I think uh um pushing
 
05:33:27.910 --> 05:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
it even faster is not prudent so I will
 
05:33:27.920 --> 05:33:29.150 align:start position:0%
it even faster is not prudent so I will
vote

05:33:29.150 --> 05:33:29.160 align:start position:0%

uh as as someone who worked uh with
 
05:33:41.350 --> 05:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
representative uh Bill Liber on the
 
05:33:43.910 --> 05:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
initial uh creation of the governor's
 
05:33:47.470 --> 05:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol and drug uh commission um had we
 
05:33:52.270 --> 05:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
known in 99 of uh what harm reduction
 
05:33:54.788 --> 05:33:54.798 align:start position:0%
was we certainly would have uh
 
05:33:58.350 --> 05:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
Incorporated it into the uh the initial
 
05:34:01.590 --> 05:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
legislation to create the commission um
 
05:34:03.830 --> 05:34:03.840 align:start position:0%

countless lives countless dollars in uh
 
05:34:10.270 --> 05:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
Healthcare costs uh harm reduction is
 
05:34:14.230 --> 05:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
proven uh uh concept to help engage
 
05:34:16.030 --> 05:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
people in treatment although that's not
 
05:34:18.830 --> 05:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
its primary target its Target is really
 
05:34:21.990 --> 05:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
to reduce health care costs and uh uh
 
05:34:25.670 --> 05:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
illness so I would uh uh certainly uh
 
05:34:31.110 --> 05:34:31.120 align:start position:0%

next up is hb994 FN representative Drew
 
05:37:33.708 --> 05:37:33.718 align:start position:0%
you would believe you have a motion on
 
05:37:33.718 --> 05:37:34.510 align:start position:0%
you would believe you have a motion on
that

05:37:34.510 --> 05:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:37:39.470 --> 05:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
also I do uh I move to O TP
 
05:37:42.070 --> 05:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
hb994 and representative damus do you
 
05:37:43.470 --> 05:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
have a second
 
05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh do either of you wish to speak to
 
05:37:45.840 --> 05:37:47.270 align:start position:0%
yes uh do either of you wish to speak to
your

05:37:47.270 --> 05:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:37:47.280 --> 05:37:51.190 align:start position:0%
your
motion

05:37:51.190 --> 05:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:51.200 --> 05:37:52.948 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:37:52.948 --> 05:37:52.958 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:37:55.948 --> 05:37:55.958 align:start position:0%
um I think it's unconscionable that the
 
05:38:00.150 --> 05:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
state pays for a medical operation that
 
05:38:03.070 --> 05:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
is cosmetic and medically unnecessary in
 
05:38:07.548 --> 05:38:07.558 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of cases and also the
 
05:38:09.990 --> 05:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
pair of botched operations when this
 
05:38:12.750 --> 05:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
operation is done incorrectly uh so I do
 
05:38:15.070 --> 05:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
not believe that we should do that and I
 
05:38:16.910 --> 05:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote
 
05:38:19.230 --> 05:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
OTP okay representative delus do you
 
05:38:20.990 --> 05:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
have anything to add to that
 
05:38:24.868 --> 05:38:24.878 align:start position:0%
or no any other discussion on the
 
05:38:28.628 --> 05:38:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:33.788 --> 05:38:33.798 align:start position:0%
lontine um yes I I am going to vote
 
05:38:38.070 --> 05:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
against this am um the opop pass motion
 
05:38:41.430 --> 05:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
um after that testimony I certainly came
 
05:38:44.230 --> 05:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh home thinking that a routine
 
05:38:46.948 --> 05:38:46.958 align:start position:0%
circumcision of newborns is is probably
 
05:38:48.190 --> 05:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
not a good
 
05:38:52.750 --> 05:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
idea um but I do have a problem that
 
05:38:55.628 --> 05:38:55.638 align:start position:0%
this bill is just Banning the procedure
 
05:38:59.390 --> 05:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
first someone on public insurance and
 
05:39:00.510 --> 05:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
not for
 
05:39:04.030 --> 05:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
everybody and in general I I'm opposed
 
05:39:06.910 --> 05:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
to that um I think it's probably a good
 
05:39:08.590 --> 05:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
idea that we have bless and maybe there
 
05:39:12.150 --> 05:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
are other ways um of going about trying
 
05:39:16.350 --> 05:39:16.360 align:start position:0%
to reduce routine circumcision such as
 
05:39:19.070 --> 05:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
maybe making
 
05:39:22.628 --> 05:39:22.638 align:start position:0%
um parents wait a month so they've had
 
05:39:24.590 --> 05:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
time to think about it and maybe gather
 
05:39:24.600 --> 05:39:26.150 align:start position:0%
time to think about it and maybe gather
more

05:39:26.150 --> 05:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:39:28.110 --> 05:39:28.120 align:start position:0%
information now that they've been home
 
05:39:30.030 --> 05:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
with their newborn baby and before
 
05:39:32.110 --> 05:39:32.120 align:start position:0%
making that choice I think a lot of it
 
05:39:34.350 --> 05:39:34.360 align:start position:0%
is that they have to make a decision
 
05:39:36.190 --> 05:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
like that while they're in the
 
05:39:40.190 --> 05:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
hospital um but it is the discrimination
 
05:39:42.910 --> 05:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
against just one group of people
 
05:39:44.948 --> 05:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
depending on their
 
05:39:47.670 --> 05:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
insurance you know and I have to say
 
05:39:50.628 --> 05:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
personally um my first husband was
 
05:39:55.670 --> 05:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
Jewish and and I agreed that our son
 
05:39:59.910 --> 05:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
would be circumcised in a a Brit Mala
 
05:40:01.628 --> 05:40:01.638 align:start position:0%
that happened at the synagogue but I
 
05:40:04.110 --> 05:40:04.120 align:start position:0%
came home from the testimony feeling a
 
05:40:06.990 --> 05:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
little distressed and I called my son
 
05:40:09.830 --> 05:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
and I I I told him about the hearing we
 
05:40:12.628 --> 05:40:12.638 align:start position:0%
had and he said I'm fine Mom I don't
 
05:40:15.110 --> 05:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
even think about it I think the
 
05:40:18.868 --> 05:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
testimony was really skewed from one
 
05:40:21.590 --> 05:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
perspective the vast majority of my
 
05:40:23.590 --> 05:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
peers were circumcised I'm not saying
 
05:40:29.510 --> 05:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
that that's um right or wrong but I
 
05:40:33.468 --> 05:40:33.478 align:start position:0%
don't think it's um it warrants our
 
05:40:36.868 --> 05:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
taking this action against uh just
 
05:40:39.948 --> 05:40:39.958 align:start position:0%
people who have one type of health
 
05:40:44.628 --> 05:40:44.638 align:start position:0%

05:40:52.190 --> 05:40:52.200 align:start position:0%

05:42:05.910 --> 05:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:42:13.350 --> 05:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:24.628 --> 05:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:24.638 --> 05:42:26.190 align:start position:0%
 
Report

05:42:26.190 --> 05:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
Report
 
05:42:29.628 --> 05:42:29.638 align:start position:0%
okay next up is House Bill 223
 
05:42:32.230 --> 05:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
representative paza I believe you have a
 
05:42:35.390 --> 05:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
motion uh I move for to pass on House
 
05:42:37.350 --> 05:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 223
 
05:42:40.628 --> 05:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
representative Maser I second okay
 
05:42:42.230 --> 05:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative POF do you wish to speak
 
05:42:45.548 --> 05:42:45.558 align:start position:0%
to your motion uh yeah yeah yes uh uh I
 
05:42:47.670 --> 05:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
move for to pass an act relative to
 
05:42:49.830 --> 05:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
licens and requirements for Health Care
 
05:42:53.468 --> 05:42:53.478 align:start position:0%
Facilities that operate within 15 miles
 
05:42:56.910 --> 05:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
of a critical exess hospital so this
 
05:43:01.310 --> 05:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
bill uh uh limits restrictions and uh
 
05:43:04.750 --> 05:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
will provide uh New Hampshire residents
 
05:43:07.670 --> 05:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
with more Access to Health Care
 
05:43:11.548 --> 05:43:11.558 align:start position:0%
we had very compelling testimony about
 
05:43:15.510 --> 05:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh importance of access to uh for
 
05:43:18.270 --> 05:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
example ambulatory surgical
 
05:43:22.110 --> 05:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
centers uh and um at the same time the
 
05:43:27.070 --> 05:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
the bill remains some protection uh for
 
05:43:30.628 --> 05:43:30.638 align:start position:0%
uh for establishing a new hospital
 
05:43:35.350 --> 05:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
near uh uh near critical exess hospital
 
05:43:38.190 --> 05:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
near existing critical exess hospital so
 
05:43:40.750 --> 05:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
I think it's a right balance and I ask
 
05:43:42.150 --> 05:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
you to support
 
05:43:45.990 --> 05:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative Weber I will
 
05:43:49.150 --> 05:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
just say that the the Old Law the
 
05:43:51.670 --> 05:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
current law was a
 
05:43:53.830 --> 05:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
compromise uh back when it was passed
 
05:43:56.548 --> 05:43:56.558 align:start position:0%
and then we've had various attempts to
 
05:44:00.350 --> 05:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
restrict it and the concern that I had
 
05:44:04.628 --> 05:44:04.638 align:start position:0%
then and continue to have now is the
 
05:44:07.390 --> 05:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
effect that
 
05:44:11.030 --> 05:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh certain businesses may have on the
 
05:44:13.750 --> 05:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
funding structure of the critical access
 
05:44:17.350 --> 05:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals nothing currently prevents
 
05:44:20.548 --> 05:44:20.558 align:start position:0%
anybody from simply giving notice and
 
05:44:22.230 --> 05:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
having discussions with a critical
 
05:44:25.070 --> 05:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
access hospital and saying the practice
 
05:44:27.150 --> 05:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
that we would like to establish is going
 
05:44:31.708 --> 05:44:31.718 align:start position:0%
to enhance your um is going to enhance
 
05:44:33.868 --> 05:44:33.878 align:start position:0%
what's offered to the the local
 
05:44:36.190 --> 05:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
population but I think that we ought to
 
05:44:39.350 --> 05:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
continue to take that into consideration
 
05:44:42.590 --> 05:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
so I will be voting no on the ought to
 
05:44:45.990 --> 05:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
pass thank you representative mlan and
 
05:44:47.990 --> 05:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
05:44:53.468 --> 05:44:53.478 align:start position:0%
pmer thank you Mr chair um I think since
 
05:44:57.468 --> 05:44:57.478 align:start position:0%
our current law passed in in
 
05:45:01.390 --> 05:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
2016 um I think we've seen access go
 
05:45:04.230 --> 05:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
down not up I think access continues to
 
05:45:07.430 --> 05:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
go down Lakes Region Hospital
 
05:45:09.510 --> 05:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
went bankrupt had to be absorbed by
 
05:45:12.190 --> 05:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
conquered Hospital Franklin Hospital
 
05:45:14.190 --> 05:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
went bankrupt had to be absorbed by
 
05:45:18.230 --> 05:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
conquered hospital um so we we heard
 
05:45:22.468 --> 05:45:22.478 align:start position:0%
testimony that it is very difficult to
 
05:45:26.708 --> 05:45:26.718 align:start position:0%
find a sustainable model for the rural
 
05:45:32.070 --> 05:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
areas of the state um and I don't know
 
05:45:35.510 --> 05:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
what the answer to that sustainability
 
05:45:37.948 --> 05:45:37.958 align:start position:0%
is I mean I'm not so arrogant to think
 
05:45:41.750 --> 05:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
that I do but I do feel um that the
 
05:45:45.990 --> 05:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
existing law and this 15 Mile exclusion
 
05:45:49.628 --> 05:45:49.638 align:start position:0%
Zone um puts up a barrier to people who
 
05:45:52.270 --> 05:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
would innovate and maybe are able to go
 
05:45:54.708 --> 05:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
to to find that solution and so I think
 
05:45:56.670 --> 05:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
you know this is just this is just a
 
05:45:59.948 --> 05:45:59.958 align:start position:0%
small thing um and you know during the
 
05:46:02.548 --> 05:46:02.558 align:start position:0%
questioning you know representative
 
05:46:05.868 --> 05:46:05.878 align:start position:0%
Weber asked a question where you know
 
05:46:06.990 --> 05:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
and it really struck out to me she she
 
05:46:10.030 --> 05:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
says listen I live in a rural area but
 
05:46:12.548 --> 05:46:12.558 align:start position:0%
it's not in one of these overlapping
 
05:46:14.510 --> 05:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
disc zones and I haven't seen any
 
05:46:17.548 --> 05:46:17.558 align:start position:0%
development there and I think that
 
05:46:19.910 --> 05:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
really says it all in that you would
 
05:46:21.548 --> 05:46:21.558 align:start position:0%
think if this was going to come in and
 
05:46:24.070 --> 05:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
be a tsunami of people taking advantage
 
05:46:26.590 --> 05:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
of that they would have already gone
 
05:46:29.190 --> 05:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
into representative Weber's area because
 
05:46:31.350 --> 05:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
everything is there are so many
 
05:46:34.070 --> 05:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
interlocking discs that that little
 
05:46:36.628 --> 05:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
small spot would be a magnet you would
 
05:46:38.628 --> 05:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
think for people to come in and develop
 
05:46:41.350 --> 05:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
but it hasn't happened so I think you
 
05:46:44.190 --> 05:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
know the boogeyman that this is going to
 
05:46:46.830 --> 05:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
just throw open uh the health care
 
05:46:48.910 --> 05:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
Market in the rural areas and it's going
 
05:46:51.670 --> 05:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
to completely destabilize everything I
 
05:46:54.070 --> 05:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
don't think it's going to happen I know
 
05:46:57.070 --> 05:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
that you know there is some risk for
 
05:46:59.310 --> 05:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
sure but I think what we need to do on
 
05:47:02.270 --> 05:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
this committee is we need to have a
 
05:47:06.430 --> 05:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
realistic assessment of what the risk is
 
05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
and weigh that against what the benefit
 
05:47:11.230 --> 05:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
is and I think realistically if we do
 
05:47:14.270 --> 05:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
nothing the model is not sustainable so
 
05:47:16.310 --> 05:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
I will be supporting this bill and thank
 
05:47:20.030 --> 05:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair representative Palmer so I
 
05:47:22.510 --> 05:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
have real concerns about this bill if
 
05:47:25.670 --> 05:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
this bill were to allow Primary Care
 
05:47:29.468 --> 05:47:29.478 align:start position:0%
Facilities to open within that range I'd
 
05:47:32.510 --> 05:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
have no problem with it um the problem
 
05:47:33.788 --> 05:47:33.798 align:start position:0%
is that's not what's going to happen
 
05:47:37.548 --> 05:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
because um as we heard earlier um during
 
05:47:41.670 --> 05:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
Dr Nagel's uh discussion of his bill um
 
05:47:44.350 --> 05:47:44.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's very difficult to run a
 
05:47:47.070 --> 05:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
primary care practice in New Hampshire
 
05:47:49.750 --> 05:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's really what we need and I mean
 
05:47:53.030 --> 05:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
we're also missing OB services but a
 
05:47:54.910 --> 05:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
surgical center there's a great example
 
05:47:59.190 --> 05:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
of what happens so about 30 years ago
 
05:48:03.708 --> 05:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
the um surgeons and GI people at Valley
 
05:48:06.430 --> 05:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
Regional had a disagreement with the CEO
 
05:48:08.750 --> 05:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
who was
 
05:48:13.628 --> 05:48:13.638 align:start position:0%
um less than good at his job and so they
 
05:48:16.708 --> 05:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
took all of their same day outpatient
 
05:48:18.868 --> 05:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
surgery across the street and open a
 
05:48:20.910 --> 05:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
Surgery Center and they very nearly put
 
05:48:23.750 --> 05:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
Valley Regional out of business
 
05:48:26.990 --> 05:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
and the the the difference between that
 
05:48:29.830 --> 05:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
and an independent Surgery Center open
 
05:48:31.990 --> 05:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
was that they still did follow their
 
05:48:33.310 --> 05:48:33.320 align:start position:0%
patients into the hospital so if they
 
05:48:34.948 --> 05:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
had a complication in their surgic
 
05:48:37.510 --> 05:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
Center they took care of it they didn't
 
05:48:39.990 --> 05:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
just say go to the ER but there's
 
05:48:42.708 --> 05:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
nothing stopping a a surgery center that
 
05:48:45.430 --> 05:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
opens up on the other side of Claremont
 
05:48:47.750 --> 05:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
from closing their door at five and just
 
05:48:49.670 --> 05:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
having a answering machine that says you
 
05:48:51.788 --> 05:48:51.798 align:start position:0%
know go to the hospital in which case
 
05:48:53.468 --> 05:48:53.478 align:start position:0%
Val Regional is again
 
05:48:56.190 --> 05:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
lost revenue and this the same day
 
05:48:58.750 --> 05:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
surgery is the revenue that's a lot of
 
05:49:01.110 --> 05:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
the time keeping these hospitals afloat
 
05:49:03.468 --> 05:49:03.478 align:start position:0%
and this year they've just had a 2.8%
 
05:49:07.110 --> 05:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
cut from Medicare on most services so
 
05:49:10.270 --> 05:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
they're even less able to absorb it
 
05:49:10.280 --> 05:49:11.948 align:start position:0%
they're even less able to absorb it
so

05:49:11.948 --> 05:49:11.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:49:15.670 --> 05:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
I I I get your your idea which is is
 
05:49:19.110 --> 05:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
good let's try to get more services
 
05:49:21.708 --> 05:49:21.718 align:start position:0%
available to people but I think this as
 
05:49:23.708 --> 05:49:23.718 align:start position:0%
the bill currently is what would happen
 
05:49:25.670 --> 05:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
is that it would be cherry-picking it
 
05:49:29.628 --> 05:49:29.638 align:start position:0%
would be people moving in and taking
 
05:49:31.310 --> 05:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
providing services that are well
 
05:49:34.350 --> 05:49:34.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursed leaving the hospitals in
 
05:49:36.430 --> 05:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
trouble so I think the only thing I
 
05:49:38.350 --> 05:49:38.360 align:start position:0%
would support here would be a further
 
05:49:40.110 --> 05:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
study to look at that and figure out how
 
05:49:42.430 --> 05:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
to make this work so that there's
 
05:49:44.868 --> 05:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
actually an increase in the services
 
05:49:47.750 --> 05:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
that we really need rather than
 
05:49:49.430 --> 05:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
potentially putting critical access
 
05:49:51.150 --> 05:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
hospitals at risk for survival because
 
05:49:53.270 --> 05:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
there're all their margins I mean in New
 
05:49:54.830 --> 05:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Vermont in the last years
 
05:49:57.070 --> 05:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
most of the critical accesses access
 
05:49:59.310 --> 05:49:59.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals in most years have been
 
05:50:04.270 --> 05:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
running at negative balance so if if the
 
05:50:07.510 --> 05:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
OTP fails I would support a and be
 
05:50:09.270 --> 05:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
willing to participate in a study to try
 
05:50:13.430 --> 05:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
and figure out how to get past my
 
05:50:16.948 --> 05:50:16.958 align:start position:0%
concerns other discussion representative
 
05:50:19.990 --> 05:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
Weber I just wanted to make it a little
 
05:50:21.270 --> 05:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
clearer as
 
05:50:25.628 --> 05:50:25.638 align:start position:0%
a follow up to my question and uh the
 
05:50:29.708 --> 05:50:29.718 align:start position:0%
earlier comment by representative mlan
 
05:50:37.270 --> 05:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:40.670 --> 05:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
in the spaces that are more than 15
 
05:50:43.150 --> 05:50:43.160 align:start position:0%
miles away from a critical a from a
 
05:50:45.150 --> 05:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
hospital not necessarily a critical
 
05:50:47.910 --> 05:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
access hospital but a hospital nobody
 
05:50:51.150 --> 05:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
wants to build because if there is an
 
05:50:54.190 --> 05:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
incident if something goes wrong if they
 
05:50:57.548 --> 05:50:57.558 align:start position:0%
need a hospital emergency room surgical
 
05:51:00.708 --> 05:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
Suite other things on an emergent
 
05:51:04.230 --> 05:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
basis uh they need to be a lot closer
 
05:51:06.070 --> 05:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
and they need to probably be closer than
 
05:51:09.628 --> 05:51:09.638 align:start position:0%
15 miles depending on how hilly their
 
05:51:13.990 --> 05:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
country is where they are so um I don't
 
05:51:16.230 --> 05:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
think the fact that nobody has come to
 
05:51:19.430 --> 05:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
Walpole to establish one of these things
 
05:51:19.440 --> 05:51:21.670 align:start position:0%
Walpole to establish one of these things
is

05:51:21.670 --> 05:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:51:25.310 --> 05:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
really um determinative because I think
 
05:51:28.190 --> 05:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
they need to be closer and I think that
 
05:51:30.868 --> 05:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
anytime there's something that will
 
05:51:34.788 --> 05:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
result in positive Synergy between the
 
05:51:37.948 --> 05:51:37.958 align:start position:0%
new group and the exist EX in hospital
 
05:51:39.628 --> 05:51:39.638 align:start position:0%
the existing hospital is going to say
 
05:51:43.510 --> 05:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
please come it's only when they are
 
05:51:48.350 --> 05:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
going to be drained of important Revenue
 
05:51:51.390 --> 05:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
that they are going to say sorry not
 
05:51:55.030 --> 05:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
happening so uh for that reason I'm
 
05:51:58.670 --> 05:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
still opposed but I do applaud the
 
05:52:01.190 --> 05:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
concern with making sure that everybody
 
05:52:03.030 --> 05:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
has more access I just don't think this
 
05:52:04.948 --> 05:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
is the way to do
 
05:52:09.070 --> 05:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
it other discuss question representative
 
05:52:13.430 --> 05:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
Woods thank you I just um adding on to
 
05:52:17.110 --> 05:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
the the lonia example um they had
 
05:52:20.430 --> 05:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
difficulties and they got bailed out um
 
05:52:24.390 --> 05:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
can we imagine if there had been say U
 
05:52:27.230 --> 05:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
Surgical Center decided to go in there I
 
05:52:29.270 --> 05:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
mean conquered Hospital couldn't have
 
05:52:33.868 --> 05:52:33.878 align:start position:0%
bailed them out so in that sense um not
 
05:52:36.868 --> 05:52:36.878 align:start position:0%
having the protections
 
05:52:39.190 --> 05:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
we would be without even the hospital
 
05:52:42.868 --> 05:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
itself which would really put a dire sit
 
05:52:46.310 --> 05:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
a dire problem in that whole whole uh
 
05:52:51.190 --> 05:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
area so um just to bring that again that
 
05:52:55.430 --> 05:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
issue of you know dominoes do
 
05:52:57.548 --> 05:52:57.558 align:start position:0%
fall any other
 
05:53:01.310 --> 05:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
discussion representative TZ I than you
 
05:53:04.468 --> 05:53:04.478 align:start position:0%
um you know I appreciate that the
 
05:53:06.590 --> 05:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
there's a concern about sustainability
 
05:53:08.510 --> 05:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
rural access but it is definitely not
 
05:53:12.110 --> 05:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
afforded by this bill um this bill uh
 
05:53:14.590 --> 05:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
would provide an opportunity for cherry
 
05:53:16.670 --> 05:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
picking and will most definitely
 
05:53:18.670 --> 05:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
undermine the fiscal viability of the
 
05:53:20.670 --> 05:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
critical AIS hospitals they're called
 
05:53:22.190 --> 05:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals because
 
05:53:26.190 --> 05:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
they're critical and um the current law
 
05:53:28.310 --> 05:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
allows the study as representative
 
05:53:30.948 --> 05:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
Palmer proposed we do studying I mean
 
05:53:33.590 --> 05:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
and no entity has been denied to date so
 
05:53:36.910 --> 05:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
the current law suffices with um
 
05:53:39.708 --> 05:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
affording what has been uh suggested
 
05:53:39.718 --> 05:53:40.628 align:start position:0%
affording what has been uh suggested

dfn representative
 
05:55:21.110 --> 05:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
Drew second you wish to speak to a
 
05:55:23.310 --> 05:55:23.320 align:start position:0%
motion representative merer yes thank
 
05:55:25.750 --> 05:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
you um the National Library of Medicine
 
05:55:28.270 --> 05:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
did an examination of the up the
 
05:55:31.548 --> 05:55:31.558 align:start position:0%
universal purchase programs as a driver
 
05:55:32.948 --> 05:55:32.958 align:start position:0%
of vaccine
 
05:55:37.390 --> 05:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
uptake um Among Us States um back in '95
 
05:55:40.390 --> 05:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
through 2014 and they found that Up
 
05:55:42.510 --> 05:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
Programs were ineffective in increasing
 
05:55:46.230 --> 05:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates and we find that DHHS
 
05:55:47.830 --> 05:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
should not be in the business of buying
 
05:55:49.750 --> 05:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
and selling vaccines for commercially
 
05:55:52.070 --> 05:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
insured children through this vaccine
 
05:55:54.230 --> 05:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
Association it is best to remove
 
05:55:55.948 --> 05:55:55.958 align:start position:0%
government from involvement in the
 
05:55:58.030 --> 05:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
purchase of medical products when
 
05:56:00.150 --> 05:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
Private Business does this quite well
 
05:56:02.510 --> 05:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
and cost effectively for vaccines for
 
05:56:05.468 --> 05:56:05.478 align:start position:0%
adults this bill won't increase parents
 
05:56:07.230 --> 05:56:07.240 align:start position:0%
cost to parents through deductibles or
 
05:56:09.990 --> 05:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
co-pays Federal Law requires that all
 
05:56:12.270 --> 05:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines for children be provided at no
 
05:56:14.830 --> 05:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
cost to the parent for the vaccines this
 
05:56:17.230 --> 05:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
bill will not change that vaccines will
 
05:56:19.628 --> 05:56:19.638 align:start position:0%
still be required to be quote unquote
 
05:56:23.030 --> 05:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
free this bill won't bring back measles
 
05:56:24.990 --> 05:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
this bill will have no impact on
 
05:56:27.628 --> 05:56:27.638 align:start position:0%
vaccination choices or rates there will
 
05:56:29.628 --> 05:56:29.638 align:start position:0%
still be tons of vaccines for everyone
 
05:56:31.788 --> 05:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
who wants them this bill is an
 
05:56:33.868 --> 05:56:33.878 align:start position:0%
anti-science it has nothing to do with
 
05:56:36.708 --> 05:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine policy it's simply a a matter of
 
05:56:38.150 --> 05:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
who's in the business of buying and
 
05:56:41.390 --> 05:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
selling a private use medical product
 
05:56:45.070 --> 05:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:49.468 --> 05:56:49.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:52.390 --> 05:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
05:56:56.750 --> 05:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
lamon yes I I can't support the uh a to
 
05:56:58.350 --> 05:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
pass on this
 
05:57:01.830 --> 05:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
bill first of all none of the um many
 
05:57:04.750 --> 05:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
pediatric clinics nor the insurers who
 
05:57:07.990 --> 05:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
are using this system came in to say oh
 
05:57:11.468 --> 05:57:11.478 align:start position:0%
it's a problem we need to fix it because
 
05:57:14.310 --> 05:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
it's not a problem it's working really
 
05:57:17.510 --> 05:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
well and it's even if it's true that the
 
05:57:19.390 --> 05:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
insurance will be
 
05:57:22.150 --> 05:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
covered you know I thought back to when
 
05:57:25.350 --> 05:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
my own children were infants and I was a
 
05:57:27.910 --> 05:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
um a graduate student with very little
 
05:57:30.910 --> 05:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
income and we went in to get our shots I
 
05:57:33.750 --> 05:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
remember wondering if I had enough money
 
05:57:36.628 --> 05:57:36.638 align:start position:0%
to pay for all the shots that day and I
 
05:57:39.150 --> 05:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
was assured no it's all taken care of
 
05:57:42.390 --> 05:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
you take away the vaccine Association we
 
05:57:44.350 --> 05:57:44.360 align:start position:0%
go back to just oh the insurance
 
05:57:46.590 --> 05:57:46.600 align:start position:0%
companies will still pay for it but then
 
05:57:48.110 --> 05:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
you have the parents going into the
 
05:57:50.430 --> 05:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
clinic wondering if that bill is going
 
05:57:53.030 --> 05:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
to be paid the doctor's office then has
 
05:57:54.990 --> 05:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
to negotiate with the insurance company
 
05:57:58.310 --> 05:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure that's gets paid for them
 
05:58:00.510 --> 05:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
you're adding this level of
 
05:58:04.190 --> 05:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
complexity that will end up disrupting
 
05:58:06.910 --> 05:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
the distribution of vaccines simply by
 
05:58:08.990 --> 05:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
making it more complicated we have a
 
05:58:11.868 --> 05:58:11.878 align:start position:0%
system that works very well and I think
 
05:58:15.788 --> 05:58:15.798 align:start position:0%
we should keep it and not really decide
 
05:58:18.270 --> 05:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
on a whim that we should do away with a
 
05:58:19.830 --> 05:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
system that works very
 
05:58:22.628 --> 05:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative
 
05:58:24.948 --> 05:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
Weber I agree with everything that
 
05:58:27.070 --> 05:58:27.080 align:start position:0%
representative ltin said and the only
 
05:58:31.868 --> 05:58:31.878 align:start position:0%
thing I want to add is that yes the
 
05:58:33.948 --> 05:58:33.958 align:start position:0%
vaccines will still be available to
 
05:58:37.110 --> 05:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
parents at no cost which is great
 
05:58:40.230 --> 05:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
but the reason the whole purpose of the
 
05:58:43.548 --> 05:58:43.558 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association was to aggregate
 
05:58:47.750 --> 05:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
purchasing power to bring down the cost
 
05:58:50.590 --> 05:58:50.600 align:start position:0%
of procurement for
 
05:58:54.868 --> 05:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
everybody and that means both people
 
05:58:57.548 --> 05:58:57.558 align:start position:0%
covered by the state and people covered
 
05:59:01.948 --> 05:59:01.958 align:start position:0%
by private insurance and so it and
 
05:59:05.750 --> 05:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
people not covered by anybody so I think
 
05:59:09.788 --> 05:59:09.798 align:start position:0%
that to repeal A system that is working
 
05:59:13.350 --> 05:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
that has been established voluntarily
 
05:59:16.670 --> 05:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
that nobody in the system is complaining
 
05:59:20.468 --> 05:59:20.478 align:start position:0%
about um and which saves the state the
 
05:59:23.430 --> 05:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and ultimately the
 
05:59:25.190 --> 05:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
people paying the premiums for the
 
05:59:31.468 --> 05:59:31.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:34.708 --> 05:59:34.718 align:start position:0%
shortsighted representative Woods yeah
 
05:59:36.830 --> 05:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um secondary arily and my
 
05:59:39.670 --> 05:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
opinion is that we'll see decreased
 
05:59:41.350 --> 05:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinations uh a lot of the
 
05:59:43.350 --> 05:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinations are carried out by private
 
05:59:46.948 --> 05:59:46.958 align:start position:0%
practice they will find it economically
 
05:59:49.468 --> 05:59:49.478 align:start position:0%
unacceptable and decide not to do
 
05:59:51.990 --> 05:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinations at which point those who
 
05:59:54.590 --> 05:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
want vaccines will now have to find
 
05:59:54.600 --> 05:59:55.670 align:start position:0%
want vaccines will now have to find
another

05:59:55.670 --> 05:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:59:59.750 --> 05:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
provider uh and that puts another layer
 
06:00:04.430 --> 06:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
on getting the uh individuals vaccinated
 
06:00:07.070 --> 06:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh so vaccination rates go down
 
06:00:10.070 --> 06:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
um and um all the accompanying problems
 
06:00:13.110 --> 06:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
with with non vaccinations and I think
 
06:00:16.990 --> 06:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
it's a serious health problem thank you
 
06:00:18.230 --> 06:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative delus did you have you
 
06:00:20.510 --> 06:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
your a hand out or no I did not okay
 
06:00:23.310 --> 06:00:23.320 align:start position:0%
sorry representative
 
06:00:27.670 --> 06:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
McGrath I think that the free market is
 
06:00:31.110 --> 06:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
really great at finding Solutions in the
 
06:00:31.120 --> 06:00:32.990 align:start position:0%
really great at finding Solutions in the
pharmacy

06:00:32.990 --> 06:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
06:00:36.948 --> 06:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
um they rolled out
 
06:00:42.788 --> 06:00:42.798 align:start position:0%
the vaccines when covid hit the market
 
06:00:45.868 --> 06:00:45.878 align:start position:0%
flawlessly and the companies are
 
06:00:47.708 --> 06:00:47.718 align:start position:0%
definitely going to make sure that their
 
06:00:51.868 --> 06:00:51.878 align:start position:0%
products get into the correct hands and
 
06:00:57.548 --> 06:00:57.558 align:start position:0%
secondly the vaccine rates are already
 
06:01:01.910 --> 06:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:04.270 --> 06:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
of the
 
06:01:07.628 --> 06:01:07.638 align:start position:0%
um I'll say the the lies
 
06:01:11.910 --> 06:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
that uh been coming out from government
 
06:01:15.070 --> 06:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
agencies people used to be lined
 
06:01:18.910 --> 06:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
up for their vaccines and nobody is
 
06:01:21.548 --> 06:01:21.558 align:start position:0%
coming in for their vaccines nobody
 
06:01:24.548 --> 06:01:24.558 align:start position:0%
wants them so if we have the state
 
06:01:26.310 --> 06:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
buying tons of
 
06:01:29.270 --> 06:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines and running this program I
 
06:01:30.350 --> 06:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
don't know what they're going to do with
 
06:01:32.468 --> 06:01:32.478 align:start position:0%
them all because I could tell you
 
06:01:35.910 --> 06:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
from from Retail Pharmacy there nobody's
 
06:01:38.190 --> 06:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
coming in for vaccines anymore
 
06:01:38.200 --> 06:01:39.270 align:start position:0%
coming in for vaccines anymore
representative

06:01:39.270 --> 06:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:01:41.548 --> 06:01:41.558 align:start position:0%
kofel thank you Mr chairman so I think
 
06:01:45.310 --> 06:01:45.320 align:start position:0%
in as far as access is concerned I think
 
06:01:48.990 --> 06:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
um you know we we see
 
06:01:51.990 --> 06:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
advertisements all the time from CVS and
 
06:01:53.708 --> 06:01:53.718 align:start position:0%
Walgreens and others of you know come
 
06:01:56.590 --> 06:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
get your vaccine it's it's free or very
 
06:01:59.788 --> 06:01:59.798 align:start position:0%
low cost um you know CVS in particular
 
06:02:01.708 --> 06:02:01.718 align:start position:0%
is you know very closely affiliated with
 
06:02:04.390 --> 06:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
one of the pharmacy benefits management
 
06:02:06.190 --> 06:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
associations I think they have the
 
06:02:09.270 --> 06:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
market power to buy and bulk and uh
 
06:02:10.750 --> 06:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
that's an example of how the free market
 
06:02:12.750 --> 06:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
I think can address this issue uh
 
06:02:14.868 --> 06:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
without government intervention so I
 
06:02:17.030 --> 06:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
will be supporting the bill
 
06:02:17.040 --> 06:02:20.270 align:start position:0%
will be supporting the bill
representative

06:02:20.270 --> 06:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:23.150 --> 06:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
lontine I'm sorry but I can't help and
 
06:02:25.708 --> 06:02:25.718 align:start position:0%
look you know not looking at this bill
 
06:02:29.468 --> 06:02:29.478 align:start position:0%
as an anti-vaccination Bill we have a
 
06:02:33.030 --> 06:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
system that works very well and it seems
 
06:02:35.948 --> 06:02:35.958 align:start position:0%
like the motivation of this bill is to
 
06:02:39.190 --> 06:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
disrupt that system and I happen to
 
06:02:42.868 --> 06:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
believe that vaccines work very
 
06:02:45.628 --> 06:02:45.638 align:start position:0%
well my husband's father was po
 
06:02:48.070 --> 06:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
paralyzed from the neck down from polio
 
06:02:48.080 --> 06:02:50.548 align:start position:0%
paralyzed from the neck down from polio
in

06:02:50.548 --> 06:02:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:54.190 --> 06:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
1955 it will be a horrible thing if
 
06:02:56.750 --> 06:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
children start losing access to the
 
06:02:59.708 --> 06:02:59.718 align:start position:0%
polio vaccine because we Destro we
 
06:03:02.070 --> 06:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
decided to disrupt a system that's
 
06:03:07.750 --> 06:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:09.750 --> 06:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
my husband I'm sure he would have rather
 
06:03:12.390 --> 06:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
played B baseball with his father in the
 
06:03:16.310 --> 06:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
backyard than spend his entire youth
 
06:03:18.468 --> 06:03:18.478 align:start position:0%
changing his father's bed
 
06:03:21.548 --> 06:03:21.558 align:start position:0%
pan so think about what you're
 
06:03:23.948 --> 06:03:23.958 align:start position:0%
doing this is not a problem that needs
 
06:03:27.030 --> 06:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:29.430 --> 06:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
fixed representative Paz off and then
 
06:03:32.548 --> 06:03:32.558 align:start position:0%
representative Parmer thank you Mr chair
 
06:03:36.750 --> 06:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
so we had to numbers uh so
 
06:03:40.430 --> 06:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
% discount and less than 1%
 
06:03:44.628 --> 06:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
administrative fee but we have no no way
 
06:03:47.990 --> 06:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
of confirming that it's actually
 
06:03:53.150 --> 06:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
effective or U because like to expand
 
06:03:57.110 --> 06:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
what uh representative kofel said like
 
06:03:59.310 --> 06:03:59.320 align:start position:0%
we often know if you
 
06:04:01.910 --> 06:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
are without insurance sometimes you have
 
06:04:04.628 --> 06:04:04.638 align:start position:0%
huge cash discount and insurance
 
06:04:09.070 --> 06:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
companies get disc discounts from um
 
06:04:12.190 --> 06:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
service providers and uh drug companies
 
06:04:15.590 --> 06:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
so definitely there could be discounts
 
06:04:18.830 --> 06:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
even better than 30% uh we don't know
 
06:04:22.030 --> 06:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
and the same with administrative cost so
 
06:04:25.430 --> 06:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
we heard that the majority of actual
 
06:04:29.070 --> 06:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
administrative cost lies outside it goes
 
06:04:29.080 --> 06:04:29.788 align:start position:0%
administrative cost lies outside it goes
for

06:04:29.788 --> 06:04:29.798 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:04:34.070 --> 06:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
example to DHHS and and uh mostly
 
06:04:38.190 --> 06:04:38.200 align:start position:0%
covered by federal funds my run out uh
 
06:04:41.070 --> 06:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
so the remaining cost that was shown to
 
06:04:44.990 --> 06:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
us is the cost of having a simple
 
06:04:47.310 --> 06:04:47.320 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet how much Insurance provide
 
06:04:52.110 --> 06:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
the Spate and how much money went out so
 
06:04:55.270 --> 06:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
paying hundreds of thousands for keeping
 
06:04:58.990 --> 06:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet uh seems excessive thank
 
06:05:02.510 --> 06:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:07.110 --> 06:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
pmer um so
 
06:05:07.120 --> 06:05:08.030 align:start position:0%
pmer um so
I

06:05:08.030 --> 06:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:05:11.030 --> 06:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
guess I'm a little frustrated on the one
 
06:05:11.040 --> 06:05:12.270 align:start position:0%
guess I'm a little frustrated on the one
hand

06:05:12.270 --> 06:05:12.280 align:start position:0%
hand
 
06:05:15.548 --> 06:05:15.558 align:start position:0%
um vaccines have saved more lives than
 
06:05:18.948 --> 06:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
any other medical intervention ever and
 
06:05:20.590 --> 06:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
they continue to do so in most of the
 
06:05:22.948 --> 06:05:22.958 align:start position:0%
world where they're been used and in
 
06:05:26.030 --> 06:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
this country we've vilified them for
 
06:05:28.948 --> 06:05:28.958 align:start position:0%
some legitimate reasons that you know
 
06:05:28.958 --> 06:05:32.788 align:start position:0%
some legitimate reasons that you know
people

06:05:32.788 --> 06:05:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:34.628 --> 06:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
um I
 
06:05:37.350 --> 06:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
guess they're not perfect so the first
 
06:05:39.590 --> 06:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
patient I saw when I moved to Clara the
 
06:05:41.350 --> 06:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
F my the very first patient was a woman
 
06:05:44.390 --> 06:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
who had gon Beret after getting a flu
 
06:05:47.868 --> 06:05:47.878 align:start position:0%
flu shot on the other hand we don't have
 
06:05:51.708 --> 06:05:51.718 align:start position:0%
1918 versions of the the flu we did have
 
06:05:53.948 --> 06:05:53.958 align:start position:0%
covid that vaccine is effective
 
06:05:56.030 --> 06:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
countries that adopted it better than we
 
06:05:59.830 --> 06:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
do did ultimately better than we did
 
06:06:03.070 --> 06:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
with with covid um
 
06:06:07.310 --> 06:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
so anything that we do that
 
06:06:12.310 --> 06:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
that further denigrates the the value of
 
06:06:15.628 --> 06:06:15.638 align:start position:0%
vaccines um that is not legitimate
 
06:06:17.310 --> 06:06:17.320 align:start position:0%
should they be studied better should we
 
06:06:20.990 --> 06:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
have better vaccines sure absolutely but
 
06:06:22.590 --> 06:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
I think we've got to be very careful
 
06:06:24.868 --> 06:06:24.878 align:start position:0%
that we don't push this to the point
 
06:06:27.150 --> 06:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
where it's a self-fulfilling prophecy
 
06:06:29.468 --> 06:06:29.478 align:start position:0%
that we make it a little harder to get F
 
06:06:31.788 --> 06:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
so the rates go down and we see say C's
 
06:06:34.990 --> 06:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
nobody wants these well I I I don't
 
06:06:35.000 --> 06:06:36.070 align:start position:0%
nobody wants these well I I I don't
really

06:06:36.070 --> 06:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
really
 
06:06:39.030 --> 06:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
agree with that I I work in Vermont
 
06:06:41.190 --> 06:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
where they have a similar program and
 
06:06:43.310 --> 06:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
there it's crucial for the people who
 
06:06:45.190 --> 06:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
don't have insurance because that's
 
06:06:47.590 --> 06:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's how they get them then they don't
 
06:06:49.270 --> 06:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
otherwise it would be a you know it
 
06:06:51.230 --> 06:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
would be up to the hospital or the
 
06:06:53.390 --> 06:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
doctor's office to provide them the
 
06:06:57.310 --> 06:06:57.320 align:start position:0%
final thing two things I'll say is um
 
06:06:59.868 --> 06:06:59.878 align:start position:0%
the where I go for my health care there
 
06:07:03.310 --> 06:07:03.320 align:start position:0%
are some vaccines that aren't covered
 
06:07:06.390 --> 06:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
um um it that Prov providers don't get
 
06:07:08.270 --> 06:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
Co coverage for the vaccine so they
 
06:07:09.868 --> 06:07:09.878 align:start position:0%
don't offer them because they'd have to
 
06:07:12.030 --> 06:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
pay out of pocket to get the vaccine and
 
06:07:13.390 --> 06:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
then they could all they could collect
 
06:07:16.390 --> 06:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
from me is the administration fee and so
 
06:07:17.750 --> 06:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
I have to go to the pharmacy to get
 
06:07:19.830 --> 06:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
those vaccines like the shingles
 
06:07:23.230 --> 06:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine and so I did because I had
 
06:07:24.750 --> 06:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
shingles when I was 19 I don't want to
 
06:07:27.788 --> 06:07:27.798 align:start position:0%
have it again I have the time the
 
06:07:30.830 --> 06:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
motivation and the money to go do that
 
06:07:33.468 --> 06:07:33.478 align:start position:0%
um but a lot of people don't have that
 
06:07:35.510 --> 06:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
so anything that makes it more difficult
 
06:07:37.830 --> 06:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be a problem and and
 
06:07:40.868 --> 06:07:40.878 align:start position:0%
ultimately end up a public health issue
 
06:07:44.788 --> 06:07:44.798 align:start position:0%
and um so my daughter uh had a baby last
 
06:07:48.030 --> 06:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
July and basically um is thinking of
 
06:07:50.670 --> 06:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
moving to New Hampshire she's that child
 
06:07:54.390 --> 06:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
has had every vaccine to prevent illness
 
06:07:56.990 --> 06:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
and what is my daughter going to think
 
06:08:00.270 --> 06:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
if she's looks at you know going to
 
06:08:02.430 --> 06:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
school in New Hampshire and 70% of the
 
06:08:05.990 --> 06:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
kids are vaccinated not the rest um I I
 
06:08:07.670 --> 06:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
just think we got to be really careful
 
06:08:10.030 --> 06:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
about what we do with
 
06:08:12.910 --> 06:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
this any final
 
06:08:15.190 --> 06:08:15.200 align:start position:0%

06:10:55.510 --> 06:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:57.948 --> 06:10:57.958 align:start position:0%
everyone let me know when you're ready
 
06:11:01.270 --> 06:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
um I representative kall W go ahead
 
06:11:05.990 --> 06:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so as I believe I said in our
 
06:11:09.628 --> 06:11:09.638 align:start position:0%
last exec session um I had reached out
 
06:11:12.270 --> 06:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
to uh a number of people I know who have
 
06:11:15.468 --> 06:11:15.478 align:start position:0%
family members with autism uh they
 
06:11:18.628 --> 06:11:18.638 align:start position:0%
were uh uniformly of the opinion that
 
06:11:21.190 --> 06:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
the autism Council um has not been
 
06:11:24.030 --> 06:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
effective it has not met uh in several
 
06:11:28.468 --> 06:11:28.478 align:start position:0%
years and that the work that they are
 
06:11:31.468 --> 06:11:31.478 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing is duplicative of
 
06:11:33.750 --> 06:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
work that is already being done by the
 
06:11:36.990 --> 06:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
um Quality Council uh on developmental
 
06:11:39.708 --> 06:11:39.718 align:start position:0%
disabilities so the amendment uh
 
06:11:41.910 --> 06:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
proposes simply to repeal the Council on
 
06:11:44.670 --> 06:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
autism as it is
 
06:11:47.390 --> 06:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
duplicative any discussion on the
 
06:11:50.070 --> 06:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
amendment yes representative
 
06:11:52.990 --> 06:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
Weber I'm going to be voting against the
 
06:11:56.230 --> 06:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
amendment because uh as we heard there
 
06:11:59.230 --> 06:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
are definitely concerns with the autism
 
06:12:01.390 --> 06:12:01.400 align:start position:0%
Council as it is currently structured
 
06:12:05.628 --> 06:12:05.638 align:start position:0%
but the bill was specifically entered to
 
06:12:10.310 --> 06:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
address those concerns and do the needed
 
06:12:13.830 --> 06:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
work over the next couple of years the
 
06:12:17.468 --> 06:12:17.478 align:start position:0%
concern that I have is that if you
 
06:12:21.310 --> 06:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
depend on the um uh developmental
 
06:12:23.350 --> 06:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
disability Council
 
06:12:25.990 --> 06:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
06:12:28.990 --> 06:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
represent folks with
 
06:12:32.310 --> 06:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
autism many of the folks with autism do
 
06:12:35.990 --> 06:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
not count do not qualify under the
 
06:12:40.510 --> 06:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
definition of disability so they will be
 
06:12:40.520 --> 06:12:41.670 align:start position:0%
definition of disability so they will be
without

06:12:41.670 --> 06:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
without
 
06:12:44.708 --> 06:12:44.718 align:start position:0%
representation and I think that we owe
 
06:12:48.190 --> 06:12:48.200 align:start position:0%
them the courtesy
 
06:12:53.590 --> 06:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
of this opportunity to hear their voices
 
06:12:55.628 --> 06:12:55.638 align:start position:0%
in both
 
06:12:59.788 --> 06:12:59.798 align:start position:0%
forums thank you other
 
06:13:02.670 --> 06:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
discussion I would just say that um I
 
06:13:06.030 --> 06:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
had received an as did representative
 
06:13:08.030 --> 06:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
kof while a number of calls
 
06:13:11.510 --> 06:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
unsolicited uh some from my own uh town
 
06:13:14.670 --> 06:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
about the council very frustrated on how
 
06:13:18.070 --> 06:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
ineffective it has been hasn't met since
 
06:13:22.468 --> 06:13:22.478 align:start position:0%
2019 uh urging that it be repealed um so
 
06:13:24.310 --> 06:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
the to the extent that there needs to be
 
06:13:28.310 --> 06:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
a forum um to to address autism this
 
06:13:30.310 --> 06:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
isn't doing it and I'm not confident
 
06:13:33.708 --> 06:13:33.718 align:start position:0%
that it will um so anyway and again this
 
06:13:35.390 --> 06:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
is based on people who have been
 
06:13:36.750 --> 06:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
actually dealing with it and actually
 
06:13:40.590 --> 06:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
have autistic children so any other
 
06:13:42.830 --> 06:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
comments not I'll ask the clerk to call
 
06:13:45.110 --> 06:13:45.120 align:start position:0%

06:16:56.320 --> 06:16:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
because

06:16:58.310 --> 06:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:17:02.510 --> 06:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
personal experience with this and it's I
 
06:17:05.788 --> 06:17:05.798 align:start position:0%
think very important to support people
 
06:17:25.270 --> 06:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:29.468 --> 06:17:29.478 align:start position:0%
onesy that I cried
 
06:17:34.990 --> 06:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:38.430 --> 06:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
like subsidizing things and don't like
 
06:17:41.868 --> 06:17:41.878 align:start position:0%
growing government and spending money I
 
06:17:44.310 --> 06:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
believe this is
 
06:17:49.390 --> 06:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
very that people are so to keep their
 
06:17:51.708 --> 06:17:51.718 align:start position:0%
home save
 
06:17:55.750 --> 06:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
money keeping their at
 
06:18:00.390 --> 06:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
home any littleit help them so I think
 
06:18:05.510 --> 06:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
that this is actually something that we
 
06:18:05.520 --> 06:18:07.468 align:start position:0%
that this is actually something that we
should

06:18:07.468 --> 06:18:07.478 align:start position:0%
should
 
06:18:09.548 --> 06:18:09.558 align:start position:0%
be representative Weber would you like
 
06:18:12.788 --> 06:18:12.798 align:start position:0%
to speak also and I would just like to
 
06:18:14.670 --> 06:18:14.680 align:start position:0%
Second everything that representative
 
06:18:17.830 --> 06:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
Delma said uh from a caregiver point of
 
06:18:21.468 --> 06:18:21.478 align:start position:0%
view and the testimony that we heard
 
06:18:24.510 --> 06:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
was uh truly truly
 
06:18:28.868 --> 06:18:28.878 align:start position:0%
moving uh the other thing and I had an
 
06:18:30.990 --> 06:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
email and I was unable to find it just
 
06:18:35.510 --> 06:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:39.350 --> 06:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
State expenditures for assistance for
 
06:18:43.350 --> 06:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
families keeping somebody at home run
 
06:18:44.868 --> 06:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
somewhere around
 
06:18:49.910 --> 06:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
$25,000 a year if that individual has to
 
06:18:52.270 --> 06:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
go to a nursing
 
06:18:55.110 --> 06:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
home uh it's more like
 
06:18:59.468 --> 06:18:59.478 align:start position:0%
$75,000 a year or more because the
 
06:19:03.910 --> 06:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
Specialized Care that um many patients
 
06:19:06.230 --> 06:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
need particular L if they are dementia
 
06:19:09.070 --> 06:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
patients is more expensive rather than
 
06:19:12.510 --> 06:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
less expensive and as we all know the
 
06:19:17.390 --> 06:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
patients who are the most difficult and
 
06:19:20.230 --> 06:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
the most medically needy come to our
 
06:19:24.150 --> 06:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
County nursing homes and um that is of
 
06:19:26.990 --> 06:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
course uh a charge on our local
 
06:19:29.830 --> 06:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so I for all of the
 
06:19:34.150 --> 06:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
compassionate reasons and for um dollars
 
06:19:36.468 --> 06:19:36.478 align:start position:0%
and cents Reasons I'm very much in favor
 
06:19:37.948 --> 06:19:37.958 align:start position:0%
of this
 
06:19:41.150 --> 06:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
bill other discussion representative
 
06:19:45.190 --> 06:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
Palazo thank you Mr chair uh I cannot
 
06:19:48.990 --> 06:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
support the bill with numbers as it
 
06:19:52.628 --> 06:19:52.638 align:start position:0%
written but uh I must say that uh I I
 
06:19:55.670 --> 06:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
agree that uh
 
06:20:00.110 --> 06:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's a awful uh situation and difficult
 
06:20:03.150 --> 06:20:03.160 align:start position:0%
situations when people uh have to care
 
06:20:06.590 --> 06:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
for loved ones 24 seven uh challenging
 
06:20:10.788 --> 06:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
for them I I also do not dispute that uh
 
06:20:15.670 --> 06:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
Home Care is more effective uh than uh
 
06:20:20.750 --> 06:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
ning uh homes but uh this bill uh it's
 
06:20:23.150 --> 06:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh expanding government it's in complete
 
06:20:25.788 --> 06:20:25.798 align:start position:0%
system with cherry picking it's
 
06:20:29.750 --> 06:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
encroachment into uh private sector and
 
06:20:33.708 --> 06:20:33.718 align:start position:0%
uh pushing out private charity and uh
 
06:20:35.190 --> 06:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
one more reason
 
06:20:38.510 --> 06:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
is resources that we
 
06:20:43.110 --> 06:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
spent on U addressing symptoms we are
 
06:20:49.190 --> 06:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
not spending on addressing the ca of
 
06:20:55.390 --> 06:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh chronic disease epidemic here and
 
06:20:58.868 --> 06:20:58.878 align:start position:0%
like uh I can I don't know if you want
 
06:21:02.350 --> 06:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
examples but uh uh in previous uh
 
06:21:05.350 --> 06:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
session this committee did not
 
06:21:11.030 --> 06:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
support uh studying uh FL fluoridation
 
06:21:15.030 --> 06:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
of water but later Biden's HHS confirmed
 
06:21:15.040 --> 06:21:15.830 align:start position:0%
of water but later Biden's HHS confirmed
that

06:21:15.830 --> 06:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:21:20.910 --> 06:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
fluide uh can can be neurotoxic so uh
 
06:21:25.350 --> 06:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
when we have uh uh some factors that we
 
06:21:28.830 --> 06:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
can address that can cause early diens
 
06:21:31.628 --> 06:21:31.638 align:start position:0%
and other things I think our focus
 
06:21:35.430 --> 06:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
should be also on those things so
 
06:21:40.310 --> 06:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh I'm uh I feel for the people but I
 
06:21:44.270 --> 06:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
think that numbers in this bill uh just
 
06:21:46.430 --> 06:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
don't match the
 
06:21:48.990 --> 06:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
moment thank you any other
 
06:21:51.190 --> 06:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative Kofa thank you Mr
 
06:21:53.430 --> 06:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
chairman as a proponent of small
 
06:21:55.910 --> 06:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
government limited government um I
 
06:21:59.030 --> 06:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
understand uh concerns about spending uh
 
06:22:00.670 --> 06:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
but as a proponent of small government I
 
06:22:02.510 --> 06:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
would say this is exactly the kind of
 
06:22:04.910 --> 06:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
program that I believe we should be
 
06:22:09.110 --> 06:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
trying to support which is uh loved ones
 
06:22:12.230 --> 06:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
family caregivers flexibility providing
 
06:22:14.190 --> 06:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
that vitally needed support for people
 
06:22:16.788 --> 06:22:16.798 align:start position:0%
in their home um at a time when they
 
06:22:18.830 --> 06:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
really really truly need it so I will be
 
06:22:20.270 --> 06:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
supporting this
 
06:22:22.750 --> 06:22:22.760 align:start position:0%

06:24:18.190 --> 06:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
on again 743 FN representative mlan did
 
06:24:21.150 --> 06:24:21.160 align:start position:0%
you have a motion yeah I'm going to move
 
06:24:25.990 --> 06:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
itl on HP 743 and I'll second
 
06:24:28.150 --> 06:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
that would you like to speak to your
 
06:24:31.310 --> 06:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair I'll be brief
 
06:24:35.750 --> 06:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the the bill has two sections the
 
06:24:38.708 --> 06:24:38.718 align:start position:0%
first section deals with the uninsured
 
06:24:40.750 --> 06:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
um and I don't really think it does any
 
06:24:42.830 --> 06:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
harm it builds on the federal no
 
06:24:45.670 --> 06:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
surprises act and if that's all that the
 
06:24:48.070 --> 06:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
bill contained I'd be okay with it but
 
06:24:50.750 --> 06:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
there's a second component that deals uh
 
06:24:53.150 --> 06:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
with the insured persons and and puts a
 
06:24:54.990 --> 06:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
lot of mandates on the insurance
 
06:24:57.548 --> 06:24:57.558 align:start position:0%
companies that the insurance department
 
06:25:00.788 --> 06:25:00.798 align:start position:0%
was not comfortable with um and you know
 
06:25:03.430 --> 06:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
we're we're a small Insurance market and
 
06:25:05.590 --> 06:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
I don't want to do any anything that uh
 
06:25:07.590 --> 06:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
would jeopardize coverage or actually
 
06:25:10.670 --> 06:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
move prices up um you know I think that
 
06:25:11.788 --> 06:25:11.798 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill should have went
 
06:25:13.548 --> 06:25:13.558 align:start position:0%
over to Commerce where they are used to
 
06:25:15.230 --> 06:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
dealing with these issues and have the
 
06:25:17.990 --> 06:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
subject knowledge uh we heard testimony
 
06:25:20.788 --> 06:25:20.798 align:start position:0%
from the insurance department that HB
 
06:25:25.070 --> 06:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
705 basically is a bill that is covering
 
06:25:27.948 --> 06:25:27.958 align:start position:0%
those components so um you know on
 
06:25:32.270 --> 06:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
balance I would look for us to itl this
 
06:25:36.270 --> 06:25:36.280 align:start position:0%
bill and um I'll be looking at uh HB 705
 
06:25:37.510 --> 06:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
out of Commerce when it comes to the
 
06:25:40.830 --> 06:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
floor thank you Mr chair okay thank you
 
06:25:44.030 --> 06:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh any other discussion representative
 
06:25:48.390 --> 06:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
palazov uh thank you mi Mr chair uh I
 
06:25:51.548 --> 06:25:51.558 align:start position:0%
agree that uh it could be the case that
 
06:25:54.350 --> 06:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
house bill uh
 
06:25:58.070 --> 06:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
705 uh deals with insurance part uh
 
06:26:02.310 --> 06:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
better than uh bill in front of us but I
 
06:26:05.430 --> 06:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
think the part that address a struggle
 
06:26:09.468 --> 06:26:09.478 align:start position:0%
of uninsured people is too important to
 
06:26:14.468 --> 06:26:14.478 align:start position:0%
throw out this bill uh at this point so
 
06:26:17.750 --> 06:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh I would still be voting or to pass
 
06:26:20.350 --> 06:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
uh but I'm ready
 
06:26:24.990 --> 06:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
to uh testified finance committee
 
06:26:28.868 --> 06:26:28.878 align:start position:0%
telling them that uh we don't need the
 
06:26:31.910 --> 06:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
insurance part of this bill uh but I
 
06:26:34.468 --> 06:26:34.478 align:start position:0%
think it's still too valuable to throw
 
06:26:38.628 --> 06:26:38.638 align:start position:0%
out thank you other
 
06:26:41.628 --> 06:26:41.638 align:start position:0%

passes okay representative kofalt do you
 
06:31:51.230 --> 06:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
have another motion I do um I I move out
 
06:31:53.590 --> 06:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
to pass with Amendment on House Bill 645
 
06:31:57.230 --> 06:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
FN I'll second that and other discussion
 
06:31:59.788 --> 06:31:59.798 align:start position:0%
put you um I'll just say that you know I
 
06:32:01.350 --> 06:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
I think that some concerns have been
 
06:32:02.670 --> 06:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
raised about the prescription drug
 
06:32:04.590 --> 06:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
affordability board
 
06:32:07.388 --> 06:32:07.398 align:start position:0%
um that it has not really been able to
 
06:32:09.190 --> 06:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
fulfill its Mission I think that this
 
06:32:11.868 --> 06:32:11.878 align:start position:0%
bill uh provides it with the tools that
 
06:32:14.510 --> 06:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
it needs to fulfill that mission uh
 
06:32:16.590 --> 06:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
which is greater transparency in
 
06:32:20.670 --> 06:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
prescription drug pricing and um you
 
06:32:22.868 --> 06:32:22.878 align:start position:0%
know with the ultimate goal of uh making
 
06:32:26.830 --> 06:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs more affordable um so
 
06:32:29.868 --> 06:32:29.878 align:start position:0%
I I support this bill U as a as a tool
 
06:32:33.468 --> 06:32:33.478 align:start position:0%
for making that happen very good any
 
06:32:36.350 --> 06:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
other question questions or
 
06:32:39.670 --> 06:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Woods uh more
 
06:32:41.510 --> 06:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
comment I think this is a step in the
 
06:32:44.910 --> 06:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
right direction but I think uh underly
 
06:32:47.830 --> 06:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
such a excuse me such other items as
 
06:32:50.548 --> 06:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
pbms and their relationship to this
 
06:32:53.270 --> 06:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
whole process which are under discussion
 
06:32:55.948 --> 06:32:55.958 align:start position:0%
nationally and to some degree here and I
 
06:32:58.230 --> 06:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
think hopefully this will allow us to
 
06:33:01.750 --> 06:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
get some of that and expose the
 
06:33:04.708 --> 06:33:04.718 align:start position:0%
pbms um and
 
06:33:06.990 --> 06:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
solve some of this cost problem so I
 
06:33:09.110 --> 06:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
think this is for that reason a good
 
06:33:12.350 --> 06:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction good okay
 
06:33:14.548 --> 06:33:14.558 align:start position:0%
any other disc representative
 
06:33:18.670 --> 06:33:18.680 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair uh I share
 
06:33:21.150 --> 06:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
some concerns that there might be some
 
06:33:25.190 --> 06:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh added cost uh of compliance with
 
06:33:30.430 --> 06:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
this uh data sharing and uh and
 
06:33:33.868 --> 06:33:33.878 align:start position:0%
that uh we are creating one more
 
06:33:37.830 --> 06:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
commission that so far haven't done
 
06:33:42.150 --> 06:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
anything but um I see it uh as giving
 
06:33:43.468 --> 06:33:43.478 align:start position:0%
them a
 
06:33:47.350 --> 06:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
chance and uh if in a few years we see
 
06:33:50.830 --> 06:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
that there's no progress we can address
 
06:33:55.468 --> 06:33:55.478 align:start position:0%
it uh then so uh I will join you in
 
06:33:57.270 --> 06:33:57.280 align:start position:0%

06:34:01.030 --> 06:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
