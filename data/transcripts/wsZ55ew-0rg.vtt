just my apologies in advance
 
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
um because all four of these bills will
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
be pertaining to housing
 
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to for just this first one
 
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
talk about the housing crisis uh very
 
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.490 align:start position:0%
talk about the housing crisis uh very
briefly

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
um and I won't repeat that through the
 
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
rest of this you know you'll already
 
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
understand and be familiar as you
 
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
probably already are with the fact that
 
00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
we're in a housing crisis and I won't
 
00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 align:start position:0%
have to repeat the reason and rationale
 
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
for for having these bills to begin with
 
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
but as you do know we are in and
 
00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 align:start position:0%
increasingly so have been for many years
 
00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 align:start position:0%
but increasingly in a severe housing
 
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
crisis especially in certain communities
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
like mine of the Seacoast region
 
00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
um and we're really talking about two
 
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
crises at the same time because another
 
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
crisis that's been facing New Hampshire
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
in fact I would say the housing and the
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh the graying of New Hampshire have
 
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
been the two biggest crises of New
 
00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for consistently for a number
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
for for a number of years and they're
 
00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139 align:start position:0%
actually very closely they're basically
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
the one in the same crisis we talk a lot
 
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
and I've been here for six years and
 
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
I've heard so many times legislators
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
talk about the gring of New Hampshire
 
00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259 align:start position:0%
and I've heard proposals such as well
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
maybe we should build a water park
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
as if 20 somethings and 30 somethings
 
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
would would be able to live here if we
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
had a water park it would it's just a
 
00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:10.259 align:start position:0%
matter of Attraction it's not New
 
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a wonderfully attractive
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
state to live in it's incredibly
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
desirable in every way except for the
 
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
fact that it's simply unlivable in many
 
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
places for many many people so
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
you deal with the housing crisis you
 
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
will automatically deal with the graying
 
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
and the reason it's called a crisis is
 
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
because it is in fact and especially now
 
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
an emergency and I mean an emergency in
 
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
the highest order of Maslow's hierarchy
 
00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:39.539 align:start position:0%
of needs emergency we are pushing people
 
00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:41.699 align:start position:0%
out of their homes many people are
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
becoming homeless it's been increasing
 
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm not talking about whatever
 
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
stigma of homeless people one might have
 
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about people working
 
00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:52.139 align:start position:0%
full-time who have up to now had a roof
 
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
over their head but just cannot find a
 
00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:56.759 align:start position:0%
place to live now
 
00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
in the last couple weeks two people have
 
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
people are not just being pushed out of
 
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
their homes but as I already mentioned
 
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
they're being pushed out of their
 
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
communities being pushed out of the
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
regions in which they work which
 
00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
effectively means they're being pushed
 
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
out of their jobs and they are in fact
 
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
being pushed out of the state the state
 
00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
that we want them to live in
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
much of this is being pushed by
 
00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:22.979 align:start position:0%
predatory landlord practices I won't go
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
into that but uh because it's not
 
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
specifically relevant to this bill but
 
00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be this way
 
00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:34.370 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be this way
um

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
in my particular Community rents have
 
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
gone up because of one particular
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
landlord buying up many of the
 
00:08:44.209 --> 00:08:44.219 align:start position:0%
multi-family homes have gone up two and
 
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
a half to three times what they were
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
January 2022 one year ago these tenants
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
have experienced increases of over a
 
00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a month these are the
 
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
people who in my town three of them are
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
postal workers
 
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
several work in the local restaurants in
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
my town they make my food when I go out
 
00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:03.959 align:start position:0%
to dinner
 
00:09:05.329 --> 00:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
um and a lot of them are young
 
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
professionals working at tech companies
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
and a number of them are actually
 
00:09:09.839 --> 00:09:11.509 align:start position:0%
and a number of them are actually
retired

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
retired
 
00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
um retired people but especially retired
 
00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
veterans they're two retired veterans
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
that were displaced uh one had just lost
 
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
a wife like the two days before finding
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
out his rent was going up or no it was
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
the other way he found out two days
 
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
before she she passed and the other one
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
is battling stage four cancer so these
 
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
are people
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
and so when we talk about the housing
 
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
crisis and I'll just wrap it up with
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
this when we talk about the housing
 
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
crisis we do talk about Workforce
 
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
housing we talk about the ability to
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
have people who actually work the jobs
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
that we keep complaining we don't have
 
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
people to work well if they can't live
 
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
in those areas you're not going to find
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
those people to work and we talk about
 
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
this in economic terms Workforce housing
 
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
how do we have the workers but it's
 
00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:54.779 align:start position:0%
really a human crisis
 
00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
it is for them not an economic theory
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
for them it is will I be living out of
 
00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
my car next month for them it is
 
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
how will I take a shower before I go
 
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519 align:start position:0%
into work what do I do with my dog while
 
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for housing do I have to
 
00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
pull my kids out of school it is a real
 
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
problem a real visceral crisis that
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:23.420 align:start position:0%
so this particular bill
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
extends a current law that we've had in
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
place for quite some time that law says
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
that owners of multi excuse me owners of
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Parks shall give 60
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
days notice to the tenants prior to
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
selling the property that they will give
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
the information to the tenants about
 
00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:46.019 align:start position:0%
what would be an acceptable offer and
 
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
other such information and we'll
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
consider in good faith any offer that
 
00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:52.940 align:start position:0%
the tenants bring to the landlord
 
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
whether an individual tenant or as a
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
group that law that's already been on
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
the books for quite some time has been
 
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:02.339 align:start position:0%
wildly successful because the incentive
 
00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
that law when it was originally passed
 
00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:07.100 align:start position:0%
was to allow tenants the opportunity to
 
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
be owners of their own Community
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
resident owned communities and since
 
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
that law has passed we now have 184
 
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
resident-owned communities in other
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
words co-ops these manufactured housing
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
Parks have gone Co-op and what you're
 
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
doing when you do that is you're doing
 
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
everything that we want in the community
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
you're making tenants into homeowners
 
00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:30.899 align:start position:0%
when you have higher rates of home
 
00:11:32.569 --> 00:11:32.579 align:start position:0%
ownership you have more stable
 
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
communities more stable workers more
 
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
stable consumers for your businesses in
 
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
that Community you have residents of the
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
community that are more long-term
 
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
invested in the well-being of the
 
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.110 align:start position:0%
invested in the well-being of the
community

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:48.620 align:start position:0%
everything pretty much every single
 
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
metric improves with increased
 
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
homeownership rates when you have half
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
of all your housing as rentals you have
 
00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
people who don't know whether they're
 
00:11:59.569 --> 00:11:59.579 align:start position:0%
going to be living in that town the
 
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
following year you have a lot of
 
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
instability a lot of changing of jobs a
 
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
lot of fluctuation in the people who are
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
living there and the businesses ability
 
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
to keep afloat
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
so everything improves everything in a
 
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
town improves when you have increased
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
rates of home ownership home ownership
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
right now especially is just not
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
achievable for many people individually
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
but if they come together we have proven
 
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
through these 184 resident owned
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
communities with the current law
 
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
in in manufactured housing parks that
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
they can and do successfully come
 
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:37.140 align:start position:0%
together buy their properties become
 
00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
homeowners and become stable long-term
 
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
the requirement to as I said it's it is
 
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
an already existing law that we are
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
simply expanding to multi-family housing
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's restricted property so it has to be
 
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
it's not like you know one person
 
00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
selling their house with an Adu or two
 
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
it's actual multi-family housing
 
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.269 align:start position:0%
it's actual multi-family housing
um

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
and that requirement as we've already
 
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
learned through the last since 1984 when
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
this law was um I believe when this law
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
was first put in place when the first
 
00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
Co-op started the manufacture housing
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
Co-op uh it is not an onerous
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
requirement for the landlord to Simply
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
say I'm planning on selling here's what
 
00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for for uh for an offer
 
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
that's not an onerous requirement
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this and nothing in
 
00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:31.139 align:start position:0%
the current law that says that they
 
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
there's a right of first refusal or they
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
have to accept it under certain terms
 
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
they simply have to entertain the offer
 
00:13:41.329 --> 00:13:41.339 align:start position:0%
in good faith that's all that's required
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
so with that because it's been so
 
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.350 align:start position:0%
so with that because it's been so
successful

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
um because we've had people across the
 
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
state in Alton by the way that 184
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
residential communities are in all 10
 
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
counties so it's not
 
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
um one specific area of the state it's
 
00:13:59.210 --> 00:13:59.220 align:start position:0%
been successful everywhere
 
00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:01.019 align:start position:0%
um with that I'll just go ahead and wrap
 
00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
up and ask that you support and take any
 
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
questions that you have thank you very
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
much representative read questions for
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
yes representative Alexander thank you
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I'm
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of torn on this because I I
 
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
hear that co-ops right the manufacturing
 
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
co-ops there's one in Goffstown for
 
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
instance on medville Co-op um there's
 
00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
like over 100 units there right so like
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
if they
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
I'm confused because nowhere in here
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
does it say like you know if if there's
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
a cash offer say that say the landlord
 
00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:35.220 align:start position:0%
was never intending on selling but
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
there's been a cash offer on it
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
um you know I think like I get texts
 
00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:40.740 align:start position:0%
from Realtors all the time like God's
 
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
Town's a hotbed like everyone wants to
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
move there
 
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
um would you like to sell your your
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
townhouse or your you know and I might
 
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
have somebody living with me or whatever
 
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:48.949 align:start position:0%
have somebody living with me or whatever
but

00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
um and there was no intention of selling
 
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
but then like right you'd ended up you
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
get offer right you get an offer and
 
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
you're it is a cash offer and you're
 
00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
like all right you know let's do it I I
 
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
find it it's hard to get a cash offer on
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
like a huge hundred unit Co-op right
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
like there's some sort of financing or
 
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
whatever my question is like does this
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
kind of hurt like property rights when
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
you have like you know somebody that
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
might want to sell a three unit house
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
and gets a cash offer on it so this
 
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to three units how many
 
00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:17.459 align:start position:0%
units I believe the current definition
 
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
of restricted units is over for over
 
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
four so right but that's still I mean
 
00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:23.459 align:start position:0%
four compared to like 100 150 that's
 
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
kind of my question is like how do we
 
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
how do we do that so this doesn't say
 
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
that a person couldn't accept a cash
 
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
offer that they weren't expecting all it
 
00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
says is that they would have to allow 60
 
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
days which if you're familiar with the
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
buying process like closing takes a long
 
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
time anyway but they they would have to
 
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
um well let me hear me you know um my
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
what I know about the co-ops uh
 
00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
particularly the ones in Newmarket is
 
00:16:00.899 --> 00:16:03.410 align:start position:0%
particularly the ones in Newmarket is
that

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
when tenants form the co-op they buy the
 
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
land and not the units on the land so
 
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
there's sort of a difference
 
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
um between you know selling individual
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
units and selling a lot of land because
 
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
the tenants actually uh lease the land
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
from the co-op ownership and that makes
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense with manufactured housing
 
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
but that's certainly not the only way to
 
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
do it in fact there's I got quite in
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
depth with Community Loan Fund which
 
00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
does a lot of the lending and helping to
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
organize these communities into co-ops
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
into resident owned communities and
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
there's about seven or eight ways to
 
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
form a co-op there's like a trust
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
there's you can incorporate there's a
 
00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:51.899 align:start position:0%
bunch of different ways to make those
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
agreements you can own your particular
 
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
unit kind of like a condo and then be
 
00:16:59.569 --> 00:16:59.579 align:start position:0%
able to sell your part of the co-op or
 
00:17:02.449 --> 00:17:02.459 align:start position:0%
you can sublease or there's restrictions
 
00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
on what you may or maybe it all depends
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
on what that group of tenants wants to
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
do and there's at least three
 
00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
organizations Community Loan Fund Chief
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
among them ready and willing to help
 
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
them help guide them in those processes
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
help them understand what their options
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
are and help them make those decisions
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have 180
 
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
184 I think
 
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
yes 184 successful Community or resident
 
00:17:32.049 --> 00:17:32.059 align:start position:0%
owned communities
 
00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
with so just the concept of co-ops has
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
been taking off across the entire
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
country there's been numerous articles
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
in the New York Times in Washington Post
 
00:17:46.029 --> 00:17:46.039 align:start position:0%
and now in California about successful
 
00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
Co-op communities those are multi-family
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
dwellings they are not
 
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
um they are not what we've been limited
 
00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
to here which is manufacture housing
 
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
parks and the only reason we're limited
 
00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
to them is not because there's anything
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
structurally about a co-op that
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
prohibits uh prohibits multi-family
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
housing it's only because the law only
 
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
applies to manufactured housing Parks
 
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
that's the only reason we've been
 
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
limited to that so just extending that
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
Whittle would really facilitate people
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
being able to buy their their Building
 
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.770 align:start position:0%
being able to buy their their Building
Together

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
Together
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.430 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
a question about the tenants
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
not necessarily good or bad
 
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
but are we talking tenants who work in
 
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or tenants who work in
 
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because I've asked this
 
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
question of some
 
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
Town managers and they say that
 
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
a great majority of the homes that are
 
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
or the apartments that are filled down
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
in Southern New Hampshire are
 
00:18:59.810 --> 00:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
predominantly people who work in
 
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts what are we talking about
 
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
here so that's inherently because of the
 
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
geographic region you just mentioned if
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
you're close to the Border you will have
 
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
increasing percentages of people who
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
work across the border so you don't have
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
people in kowas county for example
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
working in Massachusetts so it has
 
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
nothing to do literally nothing to do
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
with whether they're in a co-op or
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
whether they're an apartment and has
 
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
everything to do with how close to the
 
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
Border they are so having said that like
 
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:28.580 align:start position:0%
I mentioned before
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
184 successful resident owned
 
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
communities already in manufactured
 
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
housing across all 10 counties across
 
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
the entire state so whether you're close
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
to a border and potentially maybe more
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
likely to be working in Massachusetts or
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
whether you are in the middle of the
 
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
state and definitely definitely working
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire these communities have
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
taken off and have been successful
 
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative
 
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
but you're still not answering the
 
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
question you know where are the majority
 
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.230 align:start position:0%
question you know where are the majority
of

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
the people who don't work in in New
 
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire living as far as these kinds
 
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:15.409 --> 00:20:15.419 align:start position:0%
so I I don't see the the tie to homes I
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
see you're asking where the majority of
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
people who work across the border where
 
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
do they live and the answer will always
 
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
be near the border right that's just
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
whether they buy a home whether they
 
00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
rent a single family house whether they
 
00:20:33.049 --> 00:20:33.059 align:start position:0%
rent or buy a condo whether they rent an
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
apartment it has nothing to do with the
 
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
type of housing it has to do with how
 
00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:39.059 align:start position:0%
close they are to work
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
pushing just to be one last question one
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
those are fine generalities
 
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
but do you have any numbers of
 
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:55.100 align:start position:0%
you know the people who live in uh
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
India Dairy for example people who live
 
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
in in co-ops do you have the numbers of
 
00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
people who you're talking about here
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
talking about people in general is one
 
00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
thing but talking about them
 
00:21:09.409 --> 00:21:09.419 align:start position:0%
specifically do you have a real set of
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
numbers that would define what you're
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
saying so in terms of the already
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
existing resident owned communities I do
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
have the set of numbers for the number
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
of people in these resident owned
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
communities in each County if you're
 
00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
talking about what already exists but
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
it's definitely across relatively evenly
 
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
by population across the entire State
 
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
there's no preference or no you know
 
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
there's no factor of oh well I I live I
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
work in Massachusetts so that's why I
 
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
want a resident owned Community there's
 
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
there's no tie there at all you may work
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
across the border and therefore live
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
near the border but it has nothing to do
 
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
with whether or not you want to start a
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
resident owned Community that's that's
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
across the entire state
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
other questions uh representative
 
00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative for uh coming before us
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
today and looking forward to seeing you
 
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
three more times after today uh
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
why are you just focusing on the
 
00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:12.419 align:start position:0%
restricted properties the five plus
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
units and not looking at the smaller
 
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
properties when those may actually
 
00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
present greater opportunities for home
 
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.350 align:start position:0%
present greater opportunities for home
ownership

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
ownership
 
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.029 align:start position:0%
ownership
and

00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
and then as a as a follow-up I'll go
 
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
ahead and mention it if you need me to
 
00:22:30.289 --> 00:22:30.299 align:start position:0%
restate it I will uh the term final
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
unconditional acceptance presents very
 
00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
problematic uh because in all real
 
00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
estate transactions there's no such
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
thing as final unconditional because
 
00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:45.059 align:start position:0%
everything is based on whether the
 
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
financing goes through or acceptable
 
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
terms here inspections there all I mean
 
00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
literally all the way up to the day of
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
closing there may be a reason why the
 
00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:57.900 align:start position:0%
deal is not not finalized so at what
 
00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
point in time is a a a final
 
00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:03.659 align:start position:0%
unconditional acceptance until the lien
 
00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
is actually or the deed is actually
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
turned over so that's you know it may
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
very well be problematic language but
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
that is the language that currently I
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
had the language duplicated from the
 
00:23:15.289 --> 00:23:15.299 align:start position:0%
current existing law that's existed for
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
what I understand to be decades for
 
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Parks so if it's
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
problematic it's already problematic in
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
our statute already having said that the
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
first question was why not smaller
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
because I was trying to make this as a
 
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
small and ask as possible but I'm very
 
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
happy to extend it to other properties
 
00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
as well if you think if the committee
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
thinks that that would be in in the best
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
interest of tenants so I'm asking for a
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
little if you want to give me more I'm
 
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
happy for that as well
 
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:51.539 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
you keep using the term Co-op do you
 
00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
attribute co-ops to being
 
00:23:57.179 --> 00:23:59.090 align:start position:0%
attribute co-ops to being
um

00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
I live in a co-op I live in Londonderry
 
00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:07.700 align:start position:0%
I live in a 128 home individual homes
 
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
the developer chose it to be a co-op as
 
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
opposed to a condominium which has been
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
great for us because it keeps our but
 
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
would this apply to our homes I mean our
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
homes are
 
00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:24.299 align:start position:0%
you already you're already your Co-op so
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
you're you you are already owning right
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
I understand yeah but I just wondered if
 
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
when you talk about if someone's renting
 
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
in my area if this would impact them
 
00:24:42.649 --> 00:24:42.659 align:start position:0%
because they already you know because we
 
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
are an existing Co-op so I mean our
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
homes turn over in two days right
 
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
um and they're mostly cash authors so
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
those are individual
 
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:57.299 align:start position:0%
individual homes right so so you're
 
00:25:00.169 --> 00:25:00.179 align:start position:0%
using multi-family but then again you're
 
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
talking about manufactured homes so I
 
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
guess I'm confused about that oh that's
 
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
because I'm talking about manufactured
 
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:08.820 align:start position:0%
homes because this law exists already
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
and has for decades for manufactured
 
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
homes I'm simply extending that same
 
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
language in the current statute to
 
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
multi-family houses as well so as for
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
your question for your community you're
 
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
already Co-op this wouldn't in fact
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
affect anyone I I I'm I'm hesitating to
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
ask I'm holding in the urge to ask how
 
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
many of people in your Londonderry
 
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
no it was it was a fair bit of snark and
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
I apologize but my point is my point is
 
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
that um it you're already Co-op this
 
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect you what this does is
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
allow people who are renting from a
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
landlord that owns a large multi-family
 
00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
structure to have the opportunity if
 
00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
they so want to form a co-op put in an
 
00:25:57.529 --> 00:25:57.539 align:start position:0%
offer and have that offer fairly
 
00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
considered that's it since you're
 
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
already Co-op that doesn't apply to you
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
those individual units selling all the
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
time it's that's one unit that's not a
 
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
multi-family housing structure other
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
questions for this week yes
 
00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.610 align:start position:0%
questions for this week yes
representative

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
um representative Reed thank you for
 
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
taking my questions I wanted to ask
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
whether you would be willing to supply
 
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
us or provide for us the RSA that
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
applies to manufactured housing I'm
 
00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
happy to do that for you okay I may ask
 
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
Apollo yes of course um the other
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
question I wanted to ask is I was
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
confused and not understanding what the
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
60 days applies to is it the pns or is
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
it prior to closing could you just walk
 
00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.730 align:start position:0%
it prior to closing could you just walk
through

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
in more detail how the 60 days works so
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
like it currently works for manufactured
 
00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
housing it's before the final final
 
00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:55.799 align:start position:0%
closing so as it was already stated
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
there could be any number of factors
 
00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.049 align:start position:0%
there could be any number of factors
that

00:26:59.049 --> 00:26:59.059 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
upset or prevent something that was
 
00:27:03.409 --> 00:27:03.419 align:start position:0%
planned on closing from closing at the
 
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
last minute this essentially would
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
become one of those factors which is
 
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
that if they had not notified the the
 
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
tenant 60 days prior they would have to
 
00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:14.700 align:start position:0%
wait for that 60 days to lapse before
 
00:27:17.049 --> 00:27:17.059 align:start position:0%
the final closing
 
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up thank you
 
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.970 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up thank you
so

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:21.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
the existing tenants would
 
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
only have
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
the when would the when would the
 
00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:34.740 align:start position:0%
existing tenants have to put in a
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
counter offer or meet the offer how much
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
time would they have so there's no
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
specific restrictions on the offer the
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
only restriction is that the landlord in
 
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
good faith consider the offer so in
 
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
theory if the landlord in good faith if
 
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
the tenants put in an offer if you're
 
00:27:54.769 --> 00:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
trying to get like an example of if the
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
tenant's been an offer the day of
 
00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
closing then as long as the landlord had
 
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
considered the offer in good faith then
 
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
he could sign as long as they had the
 
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
notification 60 days prior so there's no
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's no time lapse from the offer
 
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
there's the time lapse from the
 
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.310 align:start position:0%
there's the time lapse from the
notification

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
notification
 
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
right representative cutoff
 
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
so I'm a little bit confused so does
 
00:28:18.049 --> 00:28:18.059 align:start position:0%
this mean that you want it to be
 
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
acceptable to take a multi-family singly
 
00:28:24.289 --> 00:28:24.299 align:start position:0%
owned home and split it up so that it
 
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
could be owned by multiple different
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
owners is that what this is offering so
 
00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
Co-op is one entity but it's it's an
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
entity kind of like a corporation that
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
has shareholders so all of those people
 
00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:39.299 align:start position:0%
would own part of their home having said
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
that there's multiple ways to set up a
 
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
co-op but it's not going condo if that's
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
what you mean it's different from going
 
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
condo you have an actual entity that is
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
the owner of the the property the entire
 
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
property and the people that go into the
 
00:28:58.909 --> 00:28:58.919 align:start position:0%
the the agreement for the co-op
 
00:28:58.919 --> 00:28:59.750 align:start position:0%
the the agreement for the co-op
um

00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
they agree on democratically agree on a
 
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
set of bylaws to rule them in terms of
 
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
what's acceptable what's not what kind
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
of subletting when do you sell it for
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
what can you sell it for those types of
 
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
things are all agreed to but um like I
 
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
said there's trust there's a bunch of
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
different methods but it's not it's not
 
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
the same as going condo
 
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Tripp did you
 
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.529 --> 00:29:27.539 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
my question uh
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
it seems that uh
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
this whole concept is predicated upon
 
00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:39.860 align:start position:0%
say say you have a five unit
 
00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.630 align:start position:0%
say say you have a five unit
multi-family

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
multi-family
 
00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.950 align:start position:0%
multi-family
dwelling

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
dwelling
 
00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
all five of the tenants agree to buy it
 
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh what would happen if say one tenant
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to buy it
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
so so are you you mean like four of the
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
five units the the residents of four the
 
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
five units so that those four people
 
00:30:06.769 --> 00:30:06.779 align:start position:0%
would create a co-op
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
so it's being sold right like that's the
 
00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
idea it's being sold anyway
 
00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299 align:start position:0%
so it's either being sold to another
 
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:14.039 align:start position:0%
landlord who will rent out to them
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
presumably for more money because that's
 
00:30:18.889 --> 00:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
usually how that happens or the co-op
 
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
buys it you don't need to have all
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
residents agreeing to a co-op if that's
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
what you mean
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
so that Resident would essentially be
 
00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:26.940 align:start position:0%
renting from the co-op the one that's
 
00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
staying their new landlord is the co-op
 
00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.490 align:start position:0%
staying their new landlord is the co-op
instead

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
instead
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
instead of a different landlord buying
 
00:30:39.049 --> 00:30:39.059 align:start position:0%
the the place and renting it out their
 
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
new landlord becomes the co-op
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
because that's who bought the property
 
00:30:45.769 --> 00:30:45.779 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much other
 
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
questions for the yes representative
 
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.289 align:start position:0%
questions for the yes representative
Turner

00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:48.299 align:start position:0%
Turner
 
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thanks and and thanks
 
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
representative Reed um quick question
 
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
um hopefully uh does this
 
00:30:59.690 --> 00:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
state or or imply that
 
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
uh and maybe it builds on on what
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative Gleason was asking in
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
terms of a final offer can this
 
00:31:09.529 --> 00:31:09.539 align:start position:0%
introduce a negotiation going back to
 
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
the original buyer or is it sort of the
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
idea that the original offer is fixed
 
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
and then then this gives the tenants the
 
00:31:18.169 --> 00:31:18.179 align:start position:0%
right to
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
um makes a better offer I guess oh so
 
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
like there's nothing in it restricting
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
that normal back and forth that would
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
typically happen in a negotiation so no
 
00:31:30.409 --> 00:31:30.419 align:start position:0%
this isn't enough of an offer and then
 
00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:33.140 align:start position:0%
coming back with more that that process
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
yeah just just clarifying
 
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
would that would would the owner be able
 
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
to go back to the person who made the
 
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
original offer and say
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know the tenants are willing to buy
 
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
it for this can you know in other words
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
can can it initiate bidding on this
 
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
property with the original purchaser I I
 
00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:54.299 align:start position:0%
see what you mean so by I didn't
 
00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
understand what you meant originally by
 
00:31:57.649 --> 00:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
original purchaser but in the example
 
00:31:59.810 --> 00:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
that was given earlier about somebody
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
coming in and say Hey you know you're
 
00:32:03.409 --> 00:32:03.419 align:start position:0%
not selling but I'm going to offer you
 
00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
this amount of money is that what you're
 
00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.010 align:start position:0%
this amount of money is that what you're
saying

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
so that's the original purchaser is a
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
different a different landlord
 
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
I mean you have to present the purchase
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
and sale either final or or in some
 
00:32:18.529 --> 00:32:18.539 align:start position:0%
status to the tenants
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
60 days ahead
 
00:32:24.889 --> 00:32:24.899 align:start position:0%
um if the tenants make an offer can the
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
owner of the property who's going to be
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
selling it go back to that original can
 
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
there a negotiation or is the other one
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
like fixing the initial offer and and
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
and then the tenants can only build off
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
of that right so because this is model
 
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
left off yeah after current law
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
um it's only that initial offer that has
 
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
the stipulation of having to notify an
 
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
amount that the that the seller will
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
consider to be reasonable or that would
 
00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
the seller would consider or sell at and
 
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
um and good faith consideration right so
 
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
that's the initial that just applies to
 
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
the initial offer because that's what's
 
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
already in the law I didn't want to
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
reinvent any Wheels here I wanted to
 
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
just duplicate what we have
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
see I I do have a couple of questions
 
00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:17.630 align:start position:0%
see I I do have a couple of questions
um

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
am I correct in understanding that the
 
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
the scenario you presented of the people
 
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
wanted uh tenants wanting to form a
 
00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:27.590 align:start position:0%
wanted uh tenants wanting to form a
co-op

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
co-op
 
00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:30.539 align:start position:0%
nothing in existing law would prevent
 
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
that from happening is that correct that
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
is correct nothing does prevent that
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
except for the practice of the fact that
 
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
landlords don't have to notify their
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
tenants at all until it's done in fact
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
in our town representative De Lorenzo
 
00:33:47.049 --> 00:33:47.059 align:start position:0%
and I share a town a 61 Dame Road
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
reached out to me recently because they
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
just found out that their building had
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
been finally closed like they didn't
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
know it was up for sale that it had been
 
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
closed on and that they had a new
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
landlord without ever knowing that that
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
process was in the making whatsoever in
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
fact the new landlord inspected the
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
entire property by claiming he was an
 
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
insurance adjuster so that they didn't
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
were completely unaware of the fact that
 
00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
their building was for sale and that
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
somebody was going to be purchasing it
 
00:34:16.849 --> 00:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
so because they have no right to that
 
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
information which of course impacts
 
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
their shelter and for something to
 
00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
impact such a basic needed shelter you
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
should have the right to information
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
when that's going to impact you so
 
00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
that's what's preventing it so it's not
 
00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
law that's currently preventing it it's
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
the current practice the fact that
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
there's no notification yes my question
 
00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
though is is it really realistic to
 
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
believe that if tenants have a desire
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
that they might want to purchase a
 
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
property that they wouldn't on their own
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
making and making an inquiry to a land
 
00:34:49.609 --> 00:34:49.619 align:start position:0%
to the owner saying listen you know if
 
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
you ever decide to sell this property we
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
we might be interested in buying it so
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
we hope you'll you will consider it why
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that why wouldn't that happen
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's extremely realistic because we saw
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
that we didn't have these manufactured
 
00:35:04.609 --> 00:35:04.619 align:start position:0%
housing Parks going Co-op until we've
 
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
guarantee that they had 60 days notice
 
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden they started
 
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
going Co-op and now we have 184
 
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
successful resident-owned communities
 
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
who turned from renter to homeowner like
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
every Community wants across the entire
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
State all 10 counties so with regard to
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
that that's a very good regard to that
 
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't there a fundamental
 
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
difference between the manufactured
 
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
housing situation and this in that in in
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
the manufactured housing situation the
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
very basis for that law was
 
00:35:34.609 --> 00:35:34.619 align:start position:0%
most of the time I'm not saying always
 
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
but most of the time the person owns the
 
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
manufacture tenant quote unquote owns
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
the manufactured home and doesn't but
 
00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.020 align:start position:0%
but leases the land and isn't it a lot
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't that put the manufacture the the
 
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
owner of the manufactured home in terms
 
00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
of the the economics of the situation in
 
00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
a much much weaker situation vis-a-vis
 
00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
the land the park owner than a tenant
 
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.329 align:start position:0%
the land the park owner than a tenant
versus

00:36:04.329 --> 00:36:04.339 align:start position:0%
versus
 
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
a landlord in the in the
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
non-manufactured home situation so I
 
00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
would say that the tenant in a
 
00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
multi-family housing situation is far
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
more vulnerable far weaker because at
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
the very minimum a manufactured home
 
00:36:23.569 --> 00:36:23.579 align:start position:0%
owner who owns the home but not the land
 
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
underneath it at least still owns
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
something they own something there is
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
nothing that the renter owns in this
 
00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
scenario now the idea that it's
 
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
different terms of feasibility is
 
00:36:35.569 --> 00:36:35.579 align:start position:0%
absolutely not true because we've seen
 
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
multi-family homes go Co-op across the
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
entire country very very successful and
 
00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
especially recently it's taken off all
 
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
this does is allow an extra time frame
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
for them to be notified that it's
 
00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
happening so they have the opportunity
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
to do that other questions for this
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Horan
 
00:36:56.329 --> 00:36:56.339 align:start position:0%
I think this is an excellent idea of one
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
practical question and maybe we don't
 
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
have any data on this but as a practice
 
00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:05.099 align:start position:0%
but in order to buy a property you know
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
you need a large need to be able to like
 
00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
raise a large amount of a large amount
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
of cash it's usually usually at the end
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
of the closing process the the
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
seller you know gets a check for the
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
full value of the property so how are
 
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
how are these tenants who have been
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
paying rent which is not that much less
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
or some cases more than the cost of the
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
monthly cost of
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
owning a property how often are they
 
00:37:31.609 --> 00:37:31.619 align:start position:0%
going to be able to like put together
 
00:37:31.619 --> 00:37:32.750 align:start position:0%
going to be able to like put together
the

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
the the financing in order to uh in
 
00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
order to uh you know buy the prop buy
 
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
the property
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
um in place of uh the whoever the
 
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.870 align:start position:0%
um in place of uh the whoever the
um

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
landlord would find to sell to which in
 
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
most cases would be another landlord so
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
like where are they going to get the uh
 
00:37:53.089 --> 00:37:53.099 align:start position:0%
Capital to to uh buy this right it's
 
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
it's a great question I touched on it
 
00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
briefly but it may have been before you
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
entered the room so you're right the
 
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
biggest barrier to home ownership
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
especially right now is income and
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
credit for most people to buy a single
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
family home
 
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
what going Co-op does and we see this
 
00:38:13.849 --> 00:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
with all those successful manufactured
 
00:38:16.609 --> 00:38:16.619 align:start position:0%
housing co-ops is allow them to pool
 
00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
their resources together and we have no
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
fewer than three but I think it's
 
00:38:23.329 --> 00:38:23.339 align:start position:0%
actually Four organizations but primary
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
chiefly among them Community Loan Fund
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
who is that's what they do is they loan
 
00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:31.079 align:start position:0%
to groups of residents that have come
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
together to pool their credit their
 
00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
income all of those things and you're
 
00:38:38.089 --> 00:38:38.099 align:start position:0%
very right because even it's it's a very
 
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
sad state that we're living in I don't
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
mean the state of New Hampshire I mean
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
the State of Affairs
 
00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
um it is almost always almost always the
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
case that your mortgage is less than the
 
00:38:53.089 --> 00:38:53.099 align:start position:0%
rent because there's a landlord
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
intermediary that's taking some money in
 
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
addition to the mortgage so because
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
that's always the case it's almost
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
always cheaper for a person to own and
 
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
while they're making rents payments
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
um they could easily afford Less in a
 
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
mortgage payment and yet they're being
 
00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
denied the ability to buy homes this
 
00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
allows people to overcome that kind of
 
00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
other representative trip
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:21.950 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:24.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
you're already going to give us the RSA
 
00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:33.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
housing could you also provide the uh
 
00:39:40.609 --> 00:39:40.619 align:start position:0%
RSA that permits uh uh co-ops
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
so there's that it's the same RSA it's
 
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
it's just one thing there's nothing
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
there's nothing permitting anything it's
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
just simply saying that a landlord
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
selling needs to give 60 days notice to
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
the tenants and the rest is just them in
 
00:39:58.609 --> 00:39:58.619 align:start position:0%
their own gumption coming together to to
 
00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
create a co-op there's there's nothing
 
00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
in law that specifically allows co-ops
 
00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
so much
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
um so I know I'm noting the time and I
 
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
know that we have I think seven
 
00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
Witnesses who have signed up to test
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
find us so I'm going to uh and I know
 
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
some have signed up in support some in
 
00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
opposition so
 
00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
um in the interest of time I'm going to
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
ask uh each of the follow of the
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
succeeding Witnesses here please uh do
 
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
your best to limit your testimony to
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
three minutes all right I'm gonna call
 
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
on Jane hey
 
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh good morning my name is Jane Hague
 
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
and I live at 1573 Union Street in
 
00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I appreciate the
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk with you this
 
00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
morning my husband and I are fortunate
 
00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
enough to own our own home in
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
Manchester's North End which is of
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
course as we all know a very privileged
 
00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
place to live
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
having a place to live brings that
 
00:41:01.609 --> 00:41:01.619 align:start position:0%
inexpressible peace of mind that we have
 
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
the security that no one's going to kick
 
00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
us out that the rent isn't going to be
 
00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:07.859 align:start position:0%
raised although the taxes might be
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
um but seeing homeless people over the
 
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
on our streets really gives me a lot of
 
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
pain it just pains me in my heart and
 
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
we're not really talking about
 
00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
homelessness specifically today however
 
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
with our housing crisis that
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative Reed referenced many more
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
people are in danger of losing their
 
00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
homes to a variety of
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know they could be kicked out
 
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
because their lease is up because the
 
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
landlord raises the rent that they can't
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
afford or
 
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
they could be evicted because the
 
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
landlord says they're going to renovate
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
or they have a relative moving in and
 
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
with the less than one half of one
 
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
percent vacancy rate it could be very
 
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
difficult for a person that gets kicked
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
out of their house to find a place to
 
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
live but this of course causes a lot of
 
00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.630 align:start position:0%
live but this of course causes a lot of
stress

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
stress
 
00:41:59.089 --> 00:41:59.099 align:start position:0%
um and our current system if you're not
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
owning your home you don't own a condo
 
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
and you're a renter
 
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
um we we have a situation that sets up a
 
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
kind of a contest between a landowner of
 
00:42:11.089 --> 00:42:11.099 align:start position:0%
course the landlord has rights it's
 
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
their property but we also need to
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
recognize tenant rights
 
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
and to try to level the playing field a
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
little bit so the tenants have a little
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
bit more security
 
00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.710 align:start position:0%
bit more security
um

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
and as representative Reid said this
 
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
bill would enable tenants in a
 
00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:32.060 align:start position:0%
multi-family property
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
to buy a property and set up a co-op to
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
own it and as she stated this benefits
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
communities with more people who have
 
00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:44.339 align:start position:0%
made a commitment to live in that
 
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
community and participate in community
 
00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.450 align:start position:0%
community and participate in community
affairs

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
affairs
 
00:42:49.849 --> 00:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
and I just want to say I'm part of a
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
group called Manchester housing Alliance
 
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to set up a land trust
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
that would enable this also by
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
being able to provide the financing for
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
the land kind of if you in relation to
 
00:43:05.089 --> 00:43:05.099 align:start position:0%
the bill that she said that enables the
 
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:07.140 align:start position:0%
manufactured home communities the land
 
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
trust could own the land and then the
 
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
individual unit owners could together
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
own the building or have rights to their
 
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
own unit and that way the amount of
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
money that they would have to come up
 
00:43:22.609 --> 00:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
with to pay for the building they would
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
own the building but not necessarily the
 
00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.490 align:start position:0%
own the building but not necessarily the
land

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
land
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
and that would make it more feasible and
 
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
we have been talking to the Community
 
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund and
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
other groups about enabling this so this
 
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
could be kind of we hope a way to show
 
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
that this is actually feasible all right
 
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions for this
 
00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:43.490 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions for this
win

00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
win
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much ma'am
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
I'm going to next call uh on uh can I

I'm going to next call uh on uh can I
ring

00:44:01.609 --> 00:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning uh thank you
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
to all of the representatives here for
 
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak today
 
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
um I have a lot on my mind regarding
 
00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:14.220 align:start position:0%
this this is um
 
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:16.740 align:start position:0%
this is a very troubling bill you know
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
property is one of the foundations of
 
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
our liberties and freedoms in this
 
00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:23.030 align:start position:0%
our liberties and freedoms in this
country

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
will restrict we'll actually recreate
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
a separate special class of citizens
 
00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
instead of having free market
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
we're a landowner in turn and offer his
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
property up for sale to anyone including
 
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
the tenants
 
00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
who have an opportunity to bid on the
 
00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
property and negotiate in good faith as
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
well as any other prospective buyer
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
this limits the ability of a landowner
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
to actually sell his property
 
00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
because once he's gone through the
 
00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
arduous tedious task
 
00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
of negotiating of first putting
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
the property on the market there are
 
00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:10.140 align:start position:0%
expenses associated with that
 
00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
and then finding someone and negotiating
 
00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
and finding someone willing
 
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
to purchase the property at mutually
 
00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
agreeable terms
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
then that agreement has to be put on
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
the Shelf
 
00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
for a minimum of 60 days
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
until the tenants have an opportunity to
 
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
then get involved in the process
 
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
and then have an opportunity to
 
00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:37.619 align:start position:0%
negotiate whether or not they want to
 
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
purchase the property and then that time
 
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
can be extended
 
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
if they need more time to acquire
 
00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.309 align:start position:0%
if they need more time to acquire
financing

00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
financing
 
00:45:50.809 --> 00:45:50.819 align:start position:0%
if the goal of this is to notify tenants
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
so that they have an opportunity to know
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
that the property is on the market
 
00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
that I'm fine with that
 
00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
notifying the tenants period and then
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's up to the tenants to then turn
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
around and negotiate with the landlord
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
as well as anybody else who's in the
 
00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
market for buying real estate I want to
 
00:46:11.569 --> 00:46:11.579 align:start position:0%
point something out I know that you're
 
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
short on time but this is very important
 
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
someone asked about um
 
00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
which types of properties
 
00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
this will affect it'll impact almost
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
every property in the state
 
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.370 align:start position:0%
every property in the state
if

00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
so let me let me
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
explain that
 
00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:30.839 align:start position:0%
it says no owner
 
00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:33.500 align:start position:0%
of restricted property is defined in RSA
 
00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
540 colon 1-A
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two shall make a final
 
00:46:40.849 --> 00:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
unconditional acceptance of any offer
 
00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
but the CL will transfer of the property
 
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
without first giving 60 days notice
 
00:46:47.809 --> 00:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
tweet's tenant that the owner intends to
 
00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:50.220 align:start position:0%
sell the property and of the price terms
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
and conditions of an acceptable offer
 
00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:55.700 align:start position:0%
so let's look at what
 
00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
540 colon 1 dash a Roman numeral two
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
what that definition is
 
00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
restricted property means all property
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
rented for residential purposes except
 
00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:11.339 align:start position:0%
for the property listed in paragraph one
 
00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
so let's look at paragraph one
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
non-restricted property means all real
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
property rented for non-residential
 
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
purposes and the following real property
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
rented for residential purposes
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
a single-family houses if the owner of
 
00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
such a house does not own more than
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
three single-family houses at one time
 
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
people go out and they buy
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
you're you're kind of running over your
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
time I'm sorry Mr chairman this is very
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
important so so you're saying I I I I
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
want to just finish this please there's
 
00:47:50.809 --> 00:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
a b rental units in an owner occupied
 
00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
building containing a total of four
 
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
dwelling units or fewer owner occupied
 
00:47:59.089 --> 00:47:59.099 align:start position:0%
and single-family houses acquired by
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
Banks or other mortgages so if it's not
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
owner occupied
 
00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:07.140 align:start position:0%
and the owner doesn't have three and if
 
00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
it's a single family house and they own
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
okay more than three then every real
 
00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
estate property this impacts and that's
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
not acceptable all right thank you very

pokorny from uh Derek I'm sorry you're
 
00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
good it's a hard name I understand
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm just here because as a young
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
person living in this state already it's
 
00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
so hard to keep your head above water
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
and pay your rent and have enough to pay
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
for all of your expenses already and
 
00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:02.579 align:start position:0%
when you're kind of just blindsided by
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
oh we sold the place and now your rent's
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
going up by a hundred dollars that's
 
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
just not doable when you're just maybe
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
for you guys up here like yeah 100 bucks
 
00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
is as much as it's nothing but for for
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
people like me who are barely your
 
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
salary huh it's a year's salary for us I
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
know I know but still you know you got
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
here for a reason uh for for someone
 
00:49:26.809 --> 00:49:26.819 align:start position:0%
like me it's that's out of my budget
 
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
that's that's unattainable and when
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
you're not given any notice of hey
 
00:49:31.849 --> 00:49:31.859 align:start position:0%
you're going to need an extra hundred
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
dollars on your rent this month then
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
what are you supposed to do you didn't
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
budget that in you had no notice and now
 
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
you're getting evicted from your place
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
with I believe Jane mentioned uh zero
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
percent vacancy rate now you're trying
 
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
to find a new place and it's extremely
 
00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
hard to keep young people in the state
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
and I think that we've proven that
 
00:49:53.089 --> 00:49:53.099 align:start position:0%
because the young people are fleeing to
 
00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to Maine to states that
 
00:49:59.089 --> 00:49:59.099 align:start position:0%
have more transparency in what's going
 
00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
on in their lives when you can't even
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
trust how much you're going to be paying
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
for rent here then how are you supposed
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
to continue on and and and plan for
 
00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
yourself it I feel like it's just
 
00:50:10.609 --> 00:50:10.619 align:start position:0%
basically giving the respect and
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
transparency to those people that are
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
living in that home that hey we are
 
00:50:17.329 --> 00:50:17.339 align:start position:0%
selling it and hey your rent may come up
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
or hey you may have the opportunity to
 
00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
buy this yourself and I feel like for
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
many people that that isn't really the
 
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
problem here it's just the transparency
 
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
of knowing that that hundred dollar
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
increase or that 50 increase is coming
 
00:50:31.609 --> 00:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
so that they can plan and be responsible
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
for themselves and coming up with that
 
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe cutting their Netflix or
 
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
cutting whatever they need to to be able
 
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
to still afford it and stay in that
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
place but without the transparency of
 
00:50:44.569 --> 00:50:44.579 align:start position:0%
knowing you're not giving them any room
 
00:50:47.089 --> 00:50:47.099 align:start position:0%
to succeed so I just wanted to come in
 
00:50:49.609 --> 00:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
and encourage you to support this all
 
00:50:50.809 --> 00:50:50.819 align:start position:0%
right thank you questions for this
 
00:50:50.819 --> 00:50:52.010 align:start position:0%
right thank you questions for this
Witness

Witness
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
so would you be comfortable with a bill
 
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
that said that all renters before a
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
owner sold had to give the renters 60
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
days notice that they were going to do
 
00:51:09.119 --> 00:51:10.430 align:start position:0%
days notice that they were going to do
this

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely I mean I definitely
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
encourage what the last speaker had said
 
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
it's not something that I know enough of
 
00:51:18.609 --> 00:51:18.619 align:start position:0%
to be able to really speak on but I do
 
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
agree that there should be options for
 
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
rental renters to buy that property as
 
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
well but I know for a renter like me
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
it's more that transparency of knowing
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
what's coming in advance
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
I thank you uh representative Manos did
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions for this
 
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
witness thank you very much sir thank
 
00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:40.490 align:start position:0%
witness thank you very much sir thank
you

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:46.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
my name is David Klein I'm a small
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
landlord I have 40 units in the Seacoast
 
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
area I'm not a lobbyist I'm speaking for
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
myself I'm going to try and avoid some
 
00:51:58.370 --> 00:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
of the areas that have already been
 
00:51:59.930 --> 00:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
touched upon
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
um but one of the things to note with
 
00:52:04.609 --> 00:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
renters is one third of them move out of
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
an apartment every year they don't have
 
00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
the foundation at in the or the interest
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
in the apartment building as do mobile
 
00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.370 align:start position:0%
in the apartment building as do mobile
homes

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
homes
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
mobile home owners
 
00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
and that the point I think that the
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
chairman made is that the mobile home
 
00:52:23.809 --> 00:52:23.819 align:start position:0%
owners have put down their life savings
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
or a good chunk of their net worth to
 
00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
own these mobile homes they've been
 
00:52:28.609 --> 00:52:28.619 align:start position:0%
paying for them over the years have
 
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
mortgages it is actually financially
 
00:52:32.809 --> 00:52:32.819 align:start position:0%
devastating if they have to move those
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
mobile homes
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
apartment owners do not apartment
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
renters do not have that type of
 
00:52:39.599 --> 00:52:40.730 align:start position:0%
renters do not have that type of
um

00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
interest in the building and second of
 
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
all we have renters that have all sorts
 
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
of different debt and financial
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
situations and Acumen for instance I
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
have a building where it's four units it
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
is restricted because it's not owned or
 
00:52:58.730 --> 00:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
occupied and as the other person talked
 
00:53:01.609 --> 00:53:01.619 align:start position:0%
about in 1A that you can single-family
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
homes can even be restricted if you own
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
more than three
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
um this one tenant is on disability
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
110 is section eight out of four units
 
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
how are these two people going to be
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
able to join in and get participate in a
 
00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
mortgage to purchase this property where
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
the units are selling from 150 to 200
 
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
000 per so it's an 800 000 unit and I
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
what I'm I'm not against the idea of
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
having co-ops or something like this to
 
00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:38.460 align:start position:0%
buy for the tenants to buy out what I do
 
00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:40.140 align:start position:0%
dislike is the structure of the bill
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
more than anything else if you look at
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
205a which I believe is the section the
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
statute that you were asking about for
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
mobile homes which this one is modeled
 
00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:50.579 align:start position:0%
after there's language in there about
 
00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing being involved
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
working with the tenants right up front
 
00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
there's none of that in this particular
 
00:53:58.849 --> 00:53:58.859 align:start position:0%
Bill and keep in mind with apartment
 
00:54:00.589 --> 00:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
buildings there's all sorts of issues
 
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
that we don't have with mobile homes
 
00:54:04.609 --> 00:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
because you have all of the heating
 
00:54:07.609 --> 00:54:07.619 align:start position:0%
systems roofs common area maintenance
 
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
snow plowing things of that nature so
 
00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
that in my opinion when these tenants if
 
00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:13.740 align:start position:0%
they're going to take it over they need
 
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
a structure in place for the management
 
00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
of these of the buildings and contrast
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
that to Condominiums where when a
 
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
developer puts it together he has to
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
form the Condominium Association get the
 
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
board of directors going have those
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
bylaws in place
 
00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
so for this to happen and close within
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
the 60 days or 90 days or whatever the
 
00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
time frame is that has to be in place
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
and if nothing else a bank won't lend
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
you the money if that isn't in place to
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
buy it
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
so what I'm suggesting is that this bill
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
has good Merit but not the bill itself
 
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
it needs more work I think a suggestion
 
00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
I don't know if this would work is that
 
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
yes maybe notification or have New
 
00:54:59.450 --> 00:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing reach out to landlords
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
and let them know if you're going to
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
sell notify us first have them be the
 
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
buyer and set up the Condominium
 
00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
Association and then sell back to the
 
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:08.870 align:start position:0%
Association and then sell back to the
tenants

00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
tenants
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
and the only other final point is that
 
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
it says reasonable time to close on the
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
financing that's a very ambiguous term
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
if we have an offer is six months eight
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
months you know if it's a hundred unit
 
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
apartment complex you're talking 20
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars that takes a lot of time
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
to put together financing how long are
 
00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
we supposed to wait as sellers in order
 
00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
to close and that's a problem with this
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
bill that I have also all right thank
 
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
you very much for letting me speak thank
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%

new owner to increase the rents in the
 
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
middle of a lease no
 
00:55:50.809 --> 00:55:50.819 align:start position:0%
leases leases carry over to the uh the
 
00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
new owner as long as seven years or less
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
unless they're recorded
 
00:55:58.790 --> 00:55:58.800 align:start position:0%

00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:32.700 align:start position:0%
my name is Jessica marterson
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
I'm here representing myself but I am
 
00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
also with Granite State organizing
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
project and I volunteer my time there
 
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
um and I do attendant clinic and I also
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
have Granite State tenants Association
 
00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:50.339 align:start position:0%
and through this I have a lot of
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
um clients that I get to meet and a lot
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
of different experiences with Bill hb112
 
00:56:58.790 --> 00:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
I have met many tenants along the way in
 
00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
different areas that would have
 
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
um loved to have this opportunity I have
 
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
one tenant in Salem who actually is one
 
00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
of the Westgate tenants
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
the 12 buildings is much too large for
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
him to buy but he is in a position to be
 
00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
able to go and purchase a home instead
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
of going through the cycle of having a
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
landlord anymore
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
if he was in one of these homes it would
 
00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
be perfect for him but what I wanted to
 
00:57:23.809 --> 00:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
mention is those who normally live in
 
00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
naturally occurring affordable housing
 
00:57:28.849 --> 00:57:28.859 align:start position:0%
tend to live there seven plus years I
 
00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
have met many many families that have
 
00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:33.300 align:start position:0%
lived in these houses one of them 24
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
years Rachel Gagney of Manchester her
 
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:38.339 align:start position:0%
and her husband actually renovated their
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
building before the landlord sold it and
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
then she got renovation evicted
 
00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:45.900 align:start position:0%
um insult to injury there but
 
00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:47.940 align:start position:0%
she would have given the opportunity
 
00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
looked into purchasing that house their
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
family had lived there groaned there it
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
was a home to them so these families do
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
live there and I'd like to point out it
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop
 
00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
um I understand it may take a little bit
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
more time to give them that 60 days
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
notice but the building's still for sale
 
00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
they're still getting their buildings
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
sold it's just giving a family an
 
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity that's already set down
 
00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
roots to be able to maintain those roots
 
00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:14.220 align:start position:0%
and carry on
 
00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:15.290 align:start position:0%
and carry on
um

00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:17.940 align:start position:0%

Mr Norman thank you very much for the
 
00:58:51.289 --> 00:58:51.299 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak I will try to be
 
00:58:53.450 --> 00:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
brief it's hard to do that on some of
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
these bills well we're going to try to
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
keep it just I understand thank you
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
um so I represent or I should say I'm an
 
00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
advocate for landlords
 
00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
I'm the government Affairs chair for the
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
apartment association of New Hampshire
 
00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
and put out legislative updates to
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 400
 
00:59:14.089 --> 00:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
different recipients of property owners
 
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
landlords across the state of New
 
00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:17.089 align:start position:0%
landlords across the state of New
Hampshire

00:59:17.089 --> 00:59:17.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:19.740 align:start position:0%
members of many associations of
 
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
landlords so in a landlord myself for 35
 
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
years so I'm very familiar with the
 
00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:26.150 align:start position:0%
years so I'm very familiar with the
landlording

00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
landlording
 
00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.829 align:start position:0%
landlording
world

00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
world
 
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that you realize
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
that this is really not talking about 60
 
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
days so it's talking more like four
 
00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:35.329 align:start position:0%
days so it's talking more like four
months

00:59:35.329 --> 00:59:35.339 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
so you get 60 days notice but then you
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
get time reasonable time for financing
 
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
that's very vague as David Klein had
 
00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:44.450 align:start position:0%
that's very vague as David Klein had
mentioned

00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:59:46.609 --> 00:59:46.619 align:start position:0%
I was certainly restrict an owner's
 
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
ability to negotiate a sales price
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
if you the Market's fast you know what
 
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
buyer wants to
 
00:59:58.370 --> 00:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
wait uh four months for their purchased
 
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
as a condition of the purchase and then
 
01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
not know if
 
01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:03.980 align:start position:0%
you know there's just too much
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
ambiguousness with that time frame of
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
obtaining financing and so forth
 
01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.190 align:start position:0%
obtaining financing and so forth
uh

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:12.849 --> 01:00:12.859 align:start position:0%
is it really realistic to think that
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
tenants of a large multi-family who in
 
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
the first place are often lower income
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
and don't have resources of their own or
 
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
savings are going to be able to come up
 
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
with down payments
 
01:00:29.809 --> 01:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
and everything that it needs needs to
 
01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:32.780 align:start position:0%
happen to to purchase the property
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
if they're going to
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
buy it as a group
 
01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:40.859 align:start position:0%
then one of the choices might be make it
 
01:00:40.859 --> 01:00:42.770 align:start position:0%
then one of the choices might be make it
Condominiums

01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
Condominiums
 
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
make it a trust make it an LLC
 
01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
there's no time
 
01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.230 align:start position:0%
there's no time
uh

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
you know this this is a difficult
 
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
involved process you know are the
 
01:00:56.569 --> 01:00:56.579 align:start position:0%
tenant's really ready for that
 
01:00:56.579 --> 01:00:58.609 align:start position:0%
tenant's really ready for that
and

01:00:58.609 --> 01:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
it takes a lot to be a landlord
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
an awful lot so is a group of tenants in
 
01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
a 10 unit or a hundred unit really ready
 
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
to be a landlord and manage deal with
 
01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:11.750 align:start position:0%
to be a landlord and manage deal with
financing

01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
financing
 
01:01:14.809 --> 01:01:14.819 align:start position:0%
um everything that it takes to get the
 
01:01:14.819 --> 01:01:15.829 align:start position:0%
um everything that it takes to get the
property

01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
up and running and keep it running
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
this doesn't restrict to smaller
 
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
properties you could have a 600 unit
 
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
complex a subject to this so you're
 
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
saying we have to give six notices to
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that tenants in general
 
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.150 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that tenants in general
are

01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
have really thought out and ready to to
 
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
handle everything it takes to be a
 
01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.069 align:start position:0%
handle everything it takes to be a
landlord

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
what about a sale of portfolio
 
01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:50.569 align:start position:0%
what about a sale of portfolio
properties

01:01:50.569 --> 01:01:50.579 align:start position:0%
properties
 
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
there are investors that come in and
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
they buy a investor May own five six
 
01:01:56.809 --> 01:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
seven ten different property and say I'm
 
01:01:59.089 --> 01:01:59.099 align:start position:0%
selling my whole portfolio someone comes
 
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
in to buy that portfolio they take an
 
01:02:01.799 --> 01:02:02.870 align:start position:0%
in to buy that portfolio they take an
offer

01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
offer
 
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
that they've agreed upon
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
and how are they kind of going to
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
compete with that finish up if you would
 
01:02:09.359 --> 01:02:10.250 align:start position:0%
compete with that finish up if you would
please

01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:02:13.609 --> 01:02:13.619 align:start position:0%
just many problems it restricts the
 
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
the rights of the property owner to a
 
01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:17.220 align:start position:0%
fair a quick
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh sale it just restricts too many
 
01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
options all right of the property owner
 
01:02:23.569 --> 01:02:23.579 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so questions for
 
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
this Witness
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
hey my name is Brandon Lemay I am from
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire I'm speaking in
 
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
support of house bill 112. and I myself
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
am a tenant I am a tenant organizer with
 
01:02:52.849 --> 01:02:52.859 align:start position:0%
rights in democracy uh so I want to be
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
really short today because we have a lot
 
01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
of bills to hear and a lot of speakers
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
um but I hope to provide some
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
perspective of tenants here
 
01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
um we've heard a few of the previous
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
speakers talk about what landlords or
 
01:03:05.809 --> 01:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
sorry what tenants want to do but I
 
01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
think it's kind of interesting that we
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
haven't really heard you know
 
01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
perspectives that have been tenant
 
01:03:12.049 --> 01:03:12.059 align:start position:0%
focused and I'm going to give you some
 
01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
so some of the tenants that we work with
 
01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
in our housing work group we have about
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
60 to 70 members so far and it's a
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
common occurrence for folks to say I
 
01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
don't even know that my building was on
 
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:28.140 align:start position:0%
the market and then 30 days later I got
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
a rent increase
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
I think that this bill would help out a
 
01:03:35.329 --> 01:03:35.339 align:start position:0%
lot of middle to lower income tenants
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
who are just trying to budget their way
 
01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
through their lives and if you don't
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
even know that your building is on the
 
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
market how can you prepare how can you
 
01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
budget how can you actually plan and
 
01:03:48.049 --> 01:03:48.059 align:start position:0%
make sure that you can keep living in
 
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
your home
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
so I think that this is also it's a win
 
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
for landlords and for tenants landlords
 
01:03:57.230 --> 01:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
get justly compensated for their private
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
property and then tenants get to have
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
control over their own housing
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
and it turns tenants into indirect
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers into direct taxpayers it's
 
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
going to give tenants again the
 
01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity tenants can say no I don't
 
01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
want to be a homeowner and that's
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
perfectly valid we're only giving them
 
01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
the option here
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
and in my opinion if this law is passed
 
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
it would encourage landlords to work
 
01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
with their tenants when they intend to
 
01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:26.339 align:start position:0%
sell their building
 
01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
if you're thinking hey I'm thinking
 
01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:30.299 align:start position:0%
about selling this property maybe as a
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
landlord I would want to then work with
 
01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
them to confirm if they even want to
 
01:04:36.589 --> 01:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
become owners of this building
 
01:04:39.289 --> 01:04:39.299 align:start position:0%
so and maybe they'll find out that the
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
tenants don't want to and this is not an
 
01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
issue at all so I think that this is
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
just a it's the right thing to do at the
 
01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
very least tenants should be aware that
 
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
their property the building that they're
 
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
living in and their biggest line item
 
01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
expense which is housing could possibly
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
be affected they should be informed so
 
01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
that's it and open up to questions all
 
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
right thank you sir questions for this
 
01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.010 align:start position:0%
right thank you sir questions for this
Witness

01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
01:05:05.930 --> 01:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
yes representative Manos
 
01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
question is it your understanding that
 
01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
under this post statute a an owner could
 
01:05:17.809 --> 01:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
negotiate with the existing tenants and
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
then move on and accept another offer
 
01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
absolutely in this case the landlord
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
might just find the tenants have no
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
interest and then there's absolutely no
 
01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
delay whatsoever so again yeah it would
 
01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
turn this into selling the building out
 
01:05:33.289 --> 01:05:33.299 align:start position:0%
from under the tenants without any
 
01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
knowledge to then at least being able to
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
figure out ahead of time before they're
 
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
even going to put it on the market does
 
01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
that answer your question
 
01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative
 
01:05:47.809 --> 01:05:47.819 align:start position:0%
yeah just uh along those same lines is
 
01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
is it your sort of uh testimony that it
 
01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
would be maybe more effective to
 
01:05:59.210 --> 01:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
include the the time of the listing as
 
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
the time of the notice as opposed to
 
01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
just once a purchase and sale has been
 
01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:06.059 align:start position:0%
arranged to sort of move that process
 
01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
Upstream so that the tenants are
 
01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:09.589 align:start position:0%
Upstream so that the tenants are
directly

01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
directly
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
part of the the
 
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
um cycle of of bids on the property is
 
01:06:16.609 --> 01:06:16.619 align:start position:0%
is that sort of what am I pulling that
 
01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
out of what you're what you what you had
 
01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
said or am I overreaching uh no thank
 
01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
you for that question representative if
 
01:06:24.049 --> 01:06:24.059 align:start position:0%
I understand the question uh correct I
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
actually would agree with that
 
01:06:27.289 --> 01:06:27.299 align:start position:0%
um and yeah just making sure the tenants
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
are involved maybe further up the
 
01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
process and making this easier on
 
01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:32.460 align:start position:0%
everybody is that kind of what you're
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
asking there I thank you representative
 
01:06:37.609 --> 01:06:37.619 align:start position:0%

Bill 117 and we recognize representative
 
01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
Lynn thank you Mr chair
 
01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
um members of the committee uh my name
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
is Bob Lynn I'm the representative from
 
01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
Windham and I should note at the outset
 
01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
that I am not a rental property owner I
 
01:12:44.450 --> 01:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
had I did actually own some rental
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
property in Concord probably 35 years
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
ago or so but uh I am not a rental
 
01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
property owner
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
um I guess I should say in the interest
 
01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
of full disclosure I think I I believe
 
01:12:57.649 --> 01:12:57.659 align:start position:0%
that I do have a an interest in a
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
nationally owned you know uh Reit uh
 
01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
Real Estate Investment Trust that runs
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
run by Vanguard but you know I have some
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
tiny little percentage of the total
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
ownership of that
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
um so I have no particular interest in
 
01:13:14.209 --> 01:13:14.219 align:start position:0%
in rental property one way or the other
 
01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill is to overrule a
 
01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
case that came to my attention when I
 
01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
was on the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
it was decided long long before I got
 
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
there but when I when I first heard
 
01:13:28.729 --> 01:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
about it saw it it really kind of
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
startled me because it basically says
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
that if you own if you're a landlord and
 
01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
I should say it's reply it applies only
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
to restricted property so you've heard
 
01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
the definition of restricted property if
 
01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
you if you're a if it's a single family
 
01:13:47.050 --> 01:13:47.060 align:start position:0%
home and you own more than three
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
single-family home or homes or if it's a
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
a rental uh if it's a multi-family uh
 
01:13:55.070 --> 01:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
unit I believe it's over four so it
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to you know your
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
particular house uh if you just rent out
 
01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
your your house and that's the only
 
01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:04.140 align:start position:0%
house or you only own two or whatever
 
01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
um but for so I would say it applies to
 
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
somewhat larger
 
01:14:12.169 --> 01:14:12.179 align:start position:0%
um uh landlords but basically what the
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
what the law what this case says is that
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
under the law as it now stands if you
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
are a landlord and you rent your
 
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
property to a tenant under a a year's
 
01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:25.490 align:start position:0%
property to a tenant under a a year's
lease

01:14:25.490 --> 01:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
lease
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
the lease is not really for a year it is
 
01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
potentially in perpetuity because you
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
cannot at the end of the lease you
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
cannot say as the landlord I'm
 
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
terminating this lease
 
01:14:40.010 --> 01:14:40.020 align:start position:0%
um which uh when I first read that case
 
01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
I just found it startling that that
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
would be the law because people have
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
entered into a contract that says uh you
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
have a lease for one year yet you can't
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
end the lease because the lease is up uh
 
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
to me that doesn't make
 
01:14:58.610 --> 01:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
um a lot of sense
 
01:15:01.610 --> 01:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
um and it's based on the the an
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the landlord tenant
 
01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
statute RSA 540 that says that the mere
 
01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
fact that the lease is up
 
01:15:14.689 --> 01:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
and the contract is ended is not good
 
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
cause for ending the tenancy
 
01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
um I have to say I just don't understand
 
01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
the reasoning behind that and I have to
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
say that in that case there was a
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
concurring opinion uh by Justice Netto
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
and I as uh Joe jonetto who I I was a
 
01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
person I knew for many many years a
 
01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
wonderful judge a Democrat uh it's
 
01:15:40.729 --> 01:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
hardly some you know sort of right-wing
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh judge who said this uh he concurred
 
01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:45.780 align:start position:0%
in the in the Court's decision because
 
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
there was some there was a procedural
 
01:15:50.810 --> 01:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
issue that that did not allow him to
 
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
vote to over to uh to dissent but he
 
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
basically said this the majority's
 
01:15:58.010 --> 01:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
decision just doesn't make any sense
 
01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
um I I want to just take a couple of
 
01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
seconds to talk about the Practical
 
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
implications of of the law as it now
 
01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
stands I I think it really reduces the
 
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
availability of housing to Marginal
 
01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
tenants because think about think about
 
01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:15.950 align:start position:0%
tenants because think about think about
this

01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
the landlord says to himself if he says
 
01:16:23.330 --> 01:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
to himself now or the landlord let me
 
01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
put it this way the landlord landlord
 
01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
should be able to say to himself if
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
there's someone who the landlord maybe
 
01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
has some reservation is this person
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
going to be a good tenant or not a good
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
tenant that kind of thing
 
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
the landlord
 
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
should be able to say well okay I'll
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
take a chance on this tenant because
 
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
I've only this is only a year's lease
 
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the year after China
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
turns out to be that you know my my
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
worst fears are realized then I can just
 
01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
end the lease but under existing law the
 
01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
landlord can't do that the landlord has
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
to has to say I could have this tenant
 
01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
here for a long time so the landlord may
 
01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
very well decide you know when it if
 
01:17:04.130 --> 01:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
it's a close call the landlord May well
 
01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
decide to say no I'm not taking a chance
 
01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
on this tenant and I think it seems to
 
01:17:10.189 --> 01:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
me that you know if that kind of
 
01:17:14.209 --> 01:17:14.219 align:start position:0%
thinking is repeated uh uh on a number
 
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
of occasions that that that impacts in a
 
01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
negative way the availability of of
 
01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
housing to everyone
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
um it should be the law that that Elise
 
01:17:26.450 --> 01:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
means what it says and let me emphasize
 
01:17:30.649 --> 01:17:30.659 align:start position:0%
here I'm not talking about in any way
 
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
um you know discrimination on the basis
 
01:17:36.169 --> 01:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
of race or sex or any other protected
 
01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
class that obviously is unlawful and it
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
would remain unlawful
 
01:17:41.689 --> 01:17:41.699 align:start position:0%
um under under
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
um this bill as it is now
 
01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
um I did put in uh at the request at the
 
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
suggestion of uh representative I'm
 
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
sorry of attorney Elliot Perry who I
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
don't know if he's here today or not and
 
01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to suggest that he supports
 
01:17:58.850 --> 01:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
the bill I I know he doesn't agree with
 
01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
with the bill but he did have a
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
suggestion which I thought was made
 
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
sense to limit the bill to uh uh to
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances where the where the lease
 
01:18:13.729 --> 01:18:13.739 align:start position:0%
term is is more than six months or if
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's less than six months that the lease
 
01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
term has actually that the the lease is
 
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
exact actually existed for six months so
 
01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
if it's a month to month lease but it's
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
actually uh Gone on for six months and
 
01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
my reasoning there was I think there is
 
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
a valid point that if you have a very
 
01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
short-term lease of less than six months
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
it probably is the is the expectation of
 
01:18:41.689 --> 01:18:41.699 align:start position:0%
both sides that this lease is not going
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
to end is not going to end at the end of
 
01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
a month even if it's even if it if it is
 
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
if it is a month-to-month rent most
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
people do not enter into those kind of
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
agreements expecting that they're going
 
01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
to leave in a month so I that that's why
 
01:18:59.450 --> 01:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
the the six-month limitation was uh was
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
put in there there
 
01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:04.130 align:start position:0%
put in there there
I

01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:04.140 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
there is a uh under the law as under the
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
law as it exists now which would not be
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
changed by this if you're you're
 
01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
um going to
 
01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:15.590 align:start position:0%
um going to
um

01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh Institute eviction proceedings
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
on the basis of uh for a reason other
 
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
than non-payment of rent which which
 
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
this would be this this would be the
 
01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
lease term has ended the law requires a
 
01:19:32.930 --> 01:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
30-day notice uh in order to in order to
 
01:19:36.649 --> 01:19:36.659 align:start position:0%
terminate the uh the lease and and evict
 
01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
the tenant now there's been some
 
01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:39.890 align:start position:0%
the tenant now there's been some
suggestion

01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
um that that perhaps that that
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
provision that that notice provision
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
should be longer maybe 60 days
 
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I I guess I would say I um
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
I want to think about that a little bit
 
01:19:54.649 --> 01:19:54.659 align:start position:0%
but but that might make sense I'm not
 
01:19:57.530 --> 01:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly not you know uh adamantly
 
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
opposed to that I'm not quite sure why
 
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
you know 30 days isn't enough but if
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
there were some particular reason and
 
01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
and again I I get I guess I would
 
01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
emphasize here remember we're talking
 
01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.550 align:start position:0%
emphasize here remember we're talking
about

01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
ending the lease at the end of the term
 
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
so when the landlord and tenant
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
originally entered into the lease
 
01:20:18.169 --> 01:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
obviously the tenant knows it's a
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
one-year lease
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
um but I can you know I can see that
 
01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:24.350 align:start position:0%
um but I can you know I can see that
that

01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
despite that if the landlord is intent
 
01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
on on not renewing the lease the
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
landlike and understand the idea of
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
requiring the landlord to give some
 
01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:34.130 align:start position:0%
requiring the landlord to give some
notice

01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
notice
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
um I would tend to say the 30-day notice
 
01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
the existing law would uh would provide
 
01:20:42.169 --> 01:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
for it is is okay but I'm you know if if
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
the committee thinks that it should be
 
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
something longer than that I'm certainly
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
open to uh open to considering that
 
01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.110 align:start position:0%
open to uh open to considering that
um

01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:52.610 --> 01:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
I think that's really about all I have
 
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
to say and I know we're busy and I'm
 
01:20:57.050 --> 01:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
um when this decision came down
 
01:21:11.090 --> 01:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
um do you have any idea what the uh rate
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
of available rental housing was as
 
01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
compared with what it is today
 
01:21:20.689 --> 01:21:20.699 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry represent I I really don't
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
my my suspicion is that that it the the
 
01:21:28.010 --> 01:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
availability of rental housing was
 
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
greater than than it is now that's my
 
01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
that's my suspicion because I know we
 
01:21:35.950 --> 01:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
you know we have a we have a serious uh
 
01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
problem right now in terms of the
 
01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
availability of Housing and I I and you
 
01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
know two this decision was handed down
 
01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
in 2005
 
01:21:46.130 --> 01:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
um my suspicion is that the situation
 
01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
was less
 
01:21:51.169 --> 01:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
uh was not as as dire as it is now could
 
01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
I follow up with one quick one so then
 
01:21:57.290 --> 01:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
can you uh understand how difficult it
 
01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
would be for someone who has a one-year
 
01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
lease but really expects to stay having
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
no reason to believe that then not going
 
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to stay realize how important
 
01:22:11.810 --> 01:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
it is to have as much notice as possible
 
01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
to try to find alternative housing when
 
01:22:17.570 --> 01:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
there's so little available and
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
therefore why for example 60 days is
 
01:22:23.890 --> 01:22:23.900 align:start position:0%
twice as good as 30 days
 
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
that's a valid point I I I can't dispute
 
01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
that that's a valid point you know the
 
01:22:32.450 --> 01:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
the can I just make one other point that
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
I that I neglected to say before I I
 
01:22:37.729 --> 01:22:37.739 align:start position:0%
think it's important that that everyone
 
01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
understand understand this
 
01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not here saying that this bill is
 
01:22:48.169 --> 01:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
like you know this is It's critically
 
01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
important if we don't pass this bill you
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
know the sky is going to fall I'm not
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
here saying that and the reason I want
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
to I want to emphasize that is in many
 
01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.550 align:start position:0%
to I want to emphasize that is in many
respects

01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
respects
 
01:23:00.890 --> 01:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
this bill is for lack of a better term
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a truth in advertising bill
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
because what it what what this bill
 
01:23:09.290 --> 01:23:09.300 align:start position:0%
really says is a landlord
 
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
should be able to to end a tenancy at
 
01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
the end of its term that's what the
 
01:23:17.090 --> 01:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
contract says but suppose you don't pass
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
this bill suppose it doesn't it you know
 
01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
I would introduced it last year I think
 
01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
it got through the house but it didn't
 
01:23:23.450 --> 01:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
get through the Senate suppose you don't
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
pass this bill well
 
01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
does that mean the landlord who wants to
 
01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
get rid of a tenant
 
01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
um who's a problem is not going to be
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
able to get rid of the tenant no what
 
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
the landlord will do is raise the rent
 
01:23:38.090 --> 01:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
or you know or or or use some other
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
vehicle that the landlord is is able to
 
01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
do legally under the law
 
01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
um even where uh you know and it's in
 
01:23:47.810 --> 01:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
effect that's sort of an excuse Bill
 
01:23:49.729 --> 01:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
landlord really just would would would
 
01:23:52.250 --> 01:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
not raise a rent would simply say you
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
know the lease is up and and I want you
 
01:23:56.570 --> 01:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
to and I want you to leave
 
01:23:59.209 --> 01:23:59.219 align:start position:0%
um and I guess I think it's not a good
 
01:23:59.219 --> 01:24:00.669 align:start position:0%
um and I guess I think it's not a good
thing

01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:24:04.610 --> 01:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
to put landlords in a position where
 
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
they need to find some other excuse
 
01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
which they'll find and nobody's going to
 
01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
be able to the landlord says I want to
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
raise the rent that the landlord can
 
01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
raise the rent that's not that's
 
01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
entirely legal but do you really want to
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
put a landlord in a position where they
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
have to do something like that where
 
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
they're really what they're really
 
01:24:22.729 --> 01:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
saying is you know this I I don't for
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
whatever reason not a not a
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
discriminatory reason but for whatever
 
01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
reason I don't want to renew the lease
 
01:24:32.209 --> 01:24:32.219 align:start position:0%
with this particular tenant I think I
 
01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
don't think you do want to I don't think
 
01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
the law should encourage that I think
 
01:24:37.370 --> 01:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
the law should allow you know people to
 
01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
act forthrightly with each other
 
01:24:42.890 --> 01:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:46.370 --> 01:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
representative mcbeath thank you thank
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so isn't it
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
um can't under the current law once the
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
term of the lease
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
um expires it's just a month-to-month
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
tent is tennis tenants today so both the
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
landlord and the um renter have
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
um you know Alternatives or you know to
 
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
to end the lease already I mean this
 
01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
would take away
 
01:25:13.370 --> 01:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
um really that
 
01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
I mean I think the year allows the
 
01:25:17.450 --> 01:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
landlord to recoup their expenses gives
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
the security to the renter but if the
 
01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
renter is not
 
01:25:23.090 --> 01:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
um you know for whatever reason landlord
 
01:25:24.169 --> 01:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
wants to get rid of them as you said
 
01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
they can but
 
01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
um so there are um you know remedies
 
01:25:29.209 --> 01:25:29.219 align:start position:0%
available under the current law it's not
 
01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
like the lease continues really forever
 
01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
it's just this lease to least a
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
month-to-month extension
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
no I have to respectfully disagree I
 
01:25:38.209 --> 01:25:38.219 align:start position:0%
think that that's exactly what judge
 
01:25:40.490 --> 01:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
Neto was pointing out in his in uh in
 
01:25:42.649 --> 01:25:42.659 align:start position:0%
his in his uh written opinion it's not
 
01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
it's the the landlord cannot can't that
 
01:25:48.410 --> 01:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
when that lease is extended month to
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
month the landlord can't end the month
 
01:25:52.490 --> 01:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
to month either just because the month
 
01:25:55.490 --> 01:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
to month is over so as Justice Neto
 
01:25:57.709 --> 01:25:57.719 align:start position:0%
pointed out if perpetually this is a you
 
01:25:59.149 --> 01:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
know this is a I mean this is
 
01:26:01.450 --> 01:26:01.460 align:start position:0%
theoretically a Perpetual lease now
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
obviously at some point you know uh
 
01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
economic situation is going to be such
 
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
that the landlord even the landlord is
 
01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:09.719 align:start position:0%
obviously going to raise the rent at
 
01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
some point
 
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
um and maybe the tenant wouldn't be able
 
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
to afford to pay the pay the rent and
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
then would be able to leave but but no
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's not true that once this turns into
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
a month-to-month rent it can be a
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
month-to-month tendency it can be it can
 
01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
be defeated the tenant of course can can
 
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
quit anytime but the landlord cannot
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative tur
 
01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
um and thanks representative Lynn um I
 
01:26:42.050 --> 01:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm wondering is
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
is it your understanding that
 
01:26:46.729 --> 01:26:46.739 align:start position:0%
essentially if the terms of the the
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
offer for the the lease change in any
 
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
way price or some other
 
01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
um provision that this really wouldn't
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
apply this this really applies more or
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
less in this
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
an implied right of first refusal I
 
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
guess I'd call it that that whoever is
 
01:27:07.129 --> 01:27:07.139 align:start position:0%
in in the property can continue and
 
01:27:09.410 --> 01:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
essentially if any of the other terms
 
01:27:11.930 --> 01:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
were to change like the the landlord
 
01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
wants to change the the price or or
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
place other restrictions or whatever
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
that essentially they would already be
 
01:27:21.649 --> 01:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
able to they would already be able to do
 
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
that this would only apply if they sort
 
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
of status quo but they have some other
 
01:27:27.649 --> 01:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
reason why they want that tenant to
 
01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
leave right I know I think that I think
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
that's a fair point I mean that the the
 
01:27:34.370 --> 01:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
reasoning of the majority in that case
 
01:27:36.410 --> 01:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
is sort of along the lines of what
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying basically what the
 
01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.470 align:start position:0%
you're saying basically what the
majority

01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
majority
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
um said in that case I think the
 
01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
decision was written by just delanis who
 
01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
for whom I have great respect she was a
 
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
great judge I just disagree with her on
 
01:27:51.229 --> 01:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
this but I think her her the rationale
 
01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
of the majority was well if you're
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
talking about only restricted property
 
01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
so the landlords tend to be sort of
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
bigger landlords and if the landlord
 
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
isn't trying to change the sort of
 
01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
economic or other conditions of the
 
01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:08.689 align:start position:0%
economic or other conditions of the
lease

01:28:08.689 --> 01:28:08.699 align:start position:0%
lease
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
um uh which which the landlord could do
 
01:28:12.169 --> 01:28:12.179 align:start position:0%
but if the landlord's not trying to do
 
01:28:14.689 --> 01:28:14.699 align:start position:0%
that then it shouldn't really make any
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
difference to the landlord whether the
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
tenant is tenant X or tenant why and I
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
think the problem with that is that it
 
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
was what I alluded to before in other
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
words it you know the
 
01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
you may have a situation where a
 
01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:32.030 align:start position:0%
you may have a situation where a
landlord

01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
wants to get rid of a tenant because the
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
tenant is a problem tenant and sure
 
01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
there are Provisions under the law that
 
01:28:42.169 --> 01:28:42.179 align:start position:0%
would allow the landlord to go to court
 
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
and say you know the tenant is is uh
 
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
disturbing other other uh
 
01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
uh disturbing other tenants or hurting
 
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
the property or whatever sure that's
 
01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
true but
 
01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
you can have situations it seems to me
 
01:29:00.530 --> 01:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
where a landlord doesn't want to do that
 
01:29:02.689 --> 01:29:02.699 align:start position:0%
kind of thing and just wants to be able
 
01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
to know you know as I said before I'm I
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
this is I'm take I'm willing to take a
 
01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
risk on this tenant even though I don't
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
even though I have questions about
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
whether it'll he or she will be a good
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
tenant because I only have to do this
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
for a year and if it turns out you know
 
01:29:20.209 --> 01:29:20.219 align:start position:0%
they're the my worst fears come to light
 
01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:21.900 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to end the tendency at
 
01:29:23.209 --> 01:29:23.219 align:start position:0%
the end of the year and I won't have to
 
01:29:25.689 --> 01:29:25.699 align:start position:0%
go to court and fight about did you know
 
01:29:29.810 --> 01:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
it was a tenant being too noisy or was a
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
tenant uh you know the tenant's pet
 
01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
causing problems I won't have to do that
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
I can just say it the years up you have
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
to leave
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
um but but under this case the landlord
 
01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:46.970 --> 01:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo
 
01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Chu and thank you for
 
01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:49.430 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Chu and thank you for
taking

01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:29:53.570 --> 01:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:56.330 --> 01:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
I'm listening to what you had just um
 
01:29:59.209 --> 01:29:59.219 align:start position:0%
expressed and
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
well one with a bad tenant
 
01:30:06.169 --> 01:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
now let me let me back up a bit
 
01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
once Elisa has expired and you've given
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
the Horizon a 30-day notice that they
 
01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
have to move
 
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
does not the case still have to go to
 
01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:20.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
well the case would have to go to court
 
01:30:25.129 --> 01:30:25.139 align:start position:0%
but this decision says
 
01:30:28.129 --> 01:30:28.139 align:start position:0%
you can't evict just because the lease
 
01:30:30.290 --> 01:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
is up so if you gave a 30-day note under
 
01:30:32.209 --> 01:30:32.219 align:start position:0%
current law now if you gave a 30-day
 
01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
notice saying the lease is up I want you
 
01:30:37.129 --> 01:30:37.139 align:start position:0%
to leave the tenant could say I'm not
 
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
may I found so the tenant would say I am
 
01:30:48.169 --> 01:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
not leaving but the landlife still wants
 
01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
the tenant out at that point wouldn't a
 
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:55.370 --> 01:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
well the landlord I suppose could still
 
01:30:57.950 --> 01:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
go to court but the but the under the
 
01:31:00.290 --> 01:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
law the landlord would lose so I I think
 
01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
that you know unless the landlord wanted
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
to sort of
 
01:31:06.110 --> 01:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
waste his time and maybe use money by
 
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
hiring a lawyer the landlord would
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
presumably would not go forward because
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
why do you think the landlord would lose
 
01:31:22.129 --> 01:31:22.139 align:start position:0%
because this case says because this case
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
says that this case says that if the
 
01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
mere if if the only reason you're
 
01:31:31.129 --> 01:31:31.139 align:start position:0%
looking to evict a tenant is the term of
 
01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
the lease is up you can't evict the
 
01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:35.090 align:start position:0%
the lease is up you can't evict the
tenant

01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
tenant
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's what the law says
 
01:31:40.490 --> 01:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:43.129 --> 01:31:43.139 align:start position:0%
and representative Perez
 
01:31:44.689 --> 01:31:44.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
I'm going to put this very simply as I'm
 
01:31:48.410 --> 01:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
one of the few that are not a lawyer
 
01:31:51.530 --> 01:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
here but so I own a home say I own an
 
01:31:54.410 --> 01:31:54.420 align:start position:0%
apartment building which I do not and I
 
01:31:56.330 --> 01:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
have a lease coming up at the end of
 
01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:57.850 align:start position:0%
have a lease coming up at the end of
March

01:31:57.850 --> 01:31:57.860 align:start position:0%
March
 
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
and my daughter for some reason is
 
01:32:04.189 --> 01:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
moving here from Florida and is staying
 
01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
with me and I can say to her well
 
01:32:10.250 --> 01:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
there's a lease up at the end of March
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
we you can move in the first of April
 
01:32:17.330 --> 01:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
under the current law I as a
 
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
landlord cannot do that
 
01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
under this law I would be able to do
 
01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
that is that what you're saying
 
01:32:28.129 --> 01:32:28.139 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure I under if I'm not
 
01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
quite sure I understand your example
 
01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
so okay so I own an apartment building
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a tenant whose lease is
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
going to be up I want to rent that
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
apartment to my daughter yes no no I'm
 
01:32:46.010 --> 01:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
sorry the current law I can't terminate
 
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
that lease and give it to my daughter
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
well no you know what the I think there
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
may I I'm I'm not positive about this
 
01:32:58.729 --> 01:32:58.739 align:start position:0%
but I think the answer to that is yes
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
you could because I think that there is
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
that that that probably wanting to rent
 
01:33:08.209 --> 01:33:08.219 align:start position:0%
to a family member okay let's say I
 
01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
would be to a friend I'll
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
so I again I think it becomes uh the
 
01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
friend makes it a closer question uh but
 
01:33:22.010 --> 01:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
even there if if you have
 
01:33:26.450 --> 01:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
some particular reason that you want to
 
01:33:29.209 --> 01:33:29.219 align:start position:0%
evict the tenant uh you know beyond
 
01:33:31.669 --> 01:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
there being just the the it's the end of
 
01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
the term if you if you say you know
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
um it's a family member I I I'm almost
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
positive if it's a family member you
 
01:33:41.390 --> 01:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
there's a provision that allows you to
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
do that if it's just a friend I'm not
 
01:33:45.290 --> 01:33:45.300 align:start position:0%
sure but it might be that a court would
 
01:33:48.050 --> 01:33:48.060 align:start position:0%
say well that's a you know that's a good
 
01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:51.060 align:start position:0%
reason that that is good cause but if if
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
you just if you just said
 
01:33:58.010 --> 01:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
the lease is up I want you know I want
 
01:34:02.450 --> 01:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
you out for you tenant out
 
01:34:05.570 --> 01:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
um uh that would not be that would not
 
01:34:06.770 --> 01:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
be good enough
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
you would you you would have the the
 
01:34:10.610 --> 01:34:10.620 align:start position:0%
tenant would have a right to stay
 
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
so but this
 
01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
would allow me to do that
 
01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
for a friend a family member or just a
 
01:34:23.810 --> 01:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
different person this law would allow me
 
01:34:25.370 --> 01:34:25.380 align:start position:0%
to do that right this love basically
 
01:34:26.810 --> 01:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
says you made a contract when the
 
01:34:28.490 --> 01:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
contract is over the contract is over
 
01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
and you know that you you
 
01:34:33.770 --> 01:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
the contract is over so the tenant has
 
01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions for
 
01:34:40.729 --> 01:34:40.739 align:start position:0%
representative representative Stapleton
 
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair uh thank you for
 
01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
um you cited the Supreme Court decision
 
01:34:52.970 --> 01:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
of 2005. what is the title of the name
 
01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
of that sure absolutely I'm sorry I
 
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
should it's called aimco aimco
 
01:34:58.020 --> 01:34:59.629 align:start position:0%
should it's called aimco aimco
properties

01:34:59.629 --> 01:34:59.639 align:start position:0%
properties
 
01:34:59.639 --> 01:35:01.330 align:start position:0%
properties
versus

01:35:01.330 --> 01:35:01.340 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
and it's reported at 152 New Hampshire
 
01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:12.830 align:start position:0%
and it's reported at 152 New Hampshire
587.

01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:19.090 --> 01:35:19.100 align:start position:0%
it sounds like if you want to terminate
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
this Elise you you have to have good
 
01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:22.970 align:start position:0%
this Elise you you have to have good
cause

01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
cause
 
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
if you have good cause then it sounds as
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
though that you've got a good chance of
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
being able to defend an acquire and
 
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
complete that termination without good
 
01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:34.910 align:start position:0%
complete that termination without good
cause

01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
cause
 
01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:35.890 align:start position:0%
cause
um

01:35:35.890 --> 01:35:35.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
you're inhibited from just an arbitrary
 
01:35:43.129 --> 01:35:43.139 align:start position:0%
termination of a lease under the law is
 
01:35:45.649 --> 01:35:45.659 align:start position:0%
that correct right I mean I think you're
 
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
right the question is whether the end of
 
01:35:53.209 --> 01:35:53.219 align:start position:0%
the lease term is good cause and the
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said in this case no it is
 
01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
not good cause
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
um and that's what that's basically what
 
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
I have a problem with and the purpose of
 
01:36:03.410 --> 01:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
this bill is to say
 
01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
you know normally when a contract is
 
01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:07.189 align:start position:0%
you know normally when a contract is
over

01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
um uh the contract is over and so I
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
would think that would be good cause to
 
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
uh to evict the the tenant if the tenant
 
01:36:15.649 --> 01:36:15.659 align:start position:0%
didn't want to leave
 
01:36:15.659 --> 01:36:17.930 align:start position:0%
didn't want to leave
foreign

01:36:17.930 --> 01:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:36:19.610 --> 01:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
 
01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:21.649 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative

saying none thank you

and

01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%

good morning thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:36:48.649 --> 01:36:48.659 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee for taking
 
01:36:52.129 --> 01:36:52.139 align:start position:0%
my testimony my name is Kathy style I
 
01:36:55.490 --> 01:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro District 25 which is
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
award five in Manchester
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
in the city of Manchester about 50
 
01:37:04.189 --> 01:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
percent of the people who live there are
 
01:37:04.199 --> 01:37:05.590 align:start position:0%
percent of the people who live there are
renters

01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
renters
 
01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
this I'm my goal today is to give you
 
01:37:10.970 --> 01:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
some information about who will be
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
impacted if this bill were to pass
 
01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:15.290 align:start position:0%
impacted if this bill were to pass
um

01:37:15.290 --> 01:37:15.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
currently the state has just cause
 
01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
eviction which means you can't
 
01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
um you can't evict somebody unless they
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
violated the terms of the lease they've
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
not paid rent you can ask someone to
 
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
leave if you're going to move into the
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
unit yourself or you have a family
 
01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
member who is going to move into the
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
unit yourself and themselves
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
even with just cause eviction we have a
 
01:37:43.310 --> 01:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
very serious problem with homelessness
 
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
in the city of Manchester and in a lot
 
01:37:48.590 --> 01:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
of other cities in the state
 
01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
um a lot of attention gets paid to the
 
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
people who are living on 10 intense on
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
the street corners but there's a lot of
 
01:37:57.290 --> 01:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
hidden homelessness
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
um as families with children who are
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
living in hotels I have a new neighbor
 
01:38:04.850 --> 01:38:04.860 align:start position:0%
who um with her husband and three
 
01:38:06.649 --> 01:38:06.659 align:start position:0%
children was living in a hotel for over
 
01:38:08.930 --> 01:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
a year and she just recently found a
 
01:38:10.209 --> 01:38:10.219 align:start position:0%
place to live
 
01:38:13.250 --> 01:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
I've also you know heard stories and
 
01:38:15.410 --> 01:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
have friends who are elderly who found
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
out their apartment building was being
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
sold and they were told to leave so that
 
01:38:21.890 --> 01:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
they could renovate the building and
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
raise the rent
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
and she ended up Couchsurfing for a
 
01:38:27.050 --> 01:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
number of years and this is a woman who
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
was living independently who is now in a
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
group of people that are impacted by
 
01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
this are young people usually with low
 
01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
incomes this is their first place that
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
they're living and
 
01:38:46.010 --> 01:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
um they're you know they struggle to pay
 
01:38:48.050 --> 01:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
rent and um
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
they end up living in their cars because
 
01:38:54.290 --> 01:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
they have no place to go the the
 
01:38:56.090 --> 01:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
you know the lucky ones are able to
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
double up people move in with family
 
01:38:58.679 --> 01:39:00.169 align:start position:0%
double up people move in with family
members

01:39:00.169 --> 01:39:00.179 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's very difficult and
 
01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard to keep people who are
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
working in low-income jobs you know
 
01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
people who keep at grocery stores open
 
01:39:10.250 --> 01:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
the people who are working in the
 
01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
nursing homes people who are cleaning
 
01:39:14.689 --> 01:39:14.699 align:start position:0%
the hospital those are the people who
 
01:39:16.610 --> 01:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
are most likely to be impacted by
 
01:39:18.290 --> 01:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
something like this because they don't
 
01:39:19.970 --> 01:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
have any place to go you've heard about
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
the low vacancy rates currently in
 
01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
Manchester in New Hampshire
 
01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
um average earned for a single family
 
01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
apartment is twelve hundred dollars for
 
01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
two pen bedroom it's fifteen hundred
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
dollars a month in the Hillsborough
 
01:39:34.250 --> 01:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
County it's eighteen hundred dollars a
 
01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
month for two bedroom apartment in order
 
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
to get one of those apartments if you
 
01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:40.679 align:start position:0%
can find it because the vacancy rate is
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
so low you have to prove that you have
 
01:39:45.410 --> 01:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
the income to be able to rent that that
 
01:39:47.209 --> 01:39:47.219 align:start position:0%
apartment so for example if you're
 
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
willing to pay 50 of your income for
 
01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
your housing the landlord won't rent to
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
you so it's really difficult it's a real
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
really serious situation that we have in
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester and in other
 
01:40:00.770 --> 01:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
cities around the state and I don't see
 
01:40:04.129 --> 01:40:04.139 align:start position:0%
how this bill will do anything except
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
exacerbate the problem because you're
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
going to have more people who are being
 
01:40:09.890 --> 01:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
evicted more people who can't find
 
01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
housing and more homelessness and when
 
01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
that happens you know we're a Humane
 
01:40:18.110 --> 01:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
Society so we can't abide seeing young
 
01:40:20.450 --> 01:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
families living in cars or on the
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
streets with their children so we put
 
01:40:26.209 --> 01:40:26.219 align:start position:0%
them up in hotels and that the burden of
 
01:40:28.930 --> 01:40:28.940 align:start position:0%
that falls on all of us in the society
 
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
and so I'm opposed to this bill I hope
 
01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
you don't I hope you you declare it in
 
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and I'm happy to
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
take any questions I will say that New
 
01:40:43.490 --> 01:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal aid is coming forward
 
01:40:47.689 --> 01:40:47.699 align:start position:0%
after me so questions about the legality
 
01:40:47.699 --> 01:40:48.950 align:start position:0%
after me so questions about the legality
um

01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:51.530 --> 01:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
um what might better be answered by them
 
01:40:55.970 --> 01:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:57.290 align:start position:0%
 
question

01:40:57.290 --> 01:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:41:00.770 --> 01:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:03.229 --> 01:41:03.239 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
question I didn't catch that percentage
 
01:41:08.209 --> 01:41:08.219 align:start position:0%
but you said if you if
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
tenants rent is such a percentage of
 
01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
income they won't rent to you what is
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
that percentage again
 
01:41:18.290 --> 01:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it's nice to
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
see you again we sat next to each other
 
01:41:22.129 --> 01:41:22.139 align:start position:0%
on organization day
 
01:41:22.139 --> 01:41:23.209 align:start position:0%
on organization day
um

01:41:23.209 --> 01:41:23.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:25.610 --> 01:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
um normally what um like the national
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
low-income housing Association says is
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
that you should be paying 30 of your
 
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
income for for your housing but if you
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
have to pay more than that landlords can
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
say no I'm not going to rent to you and
 
01:41:40.129 --> 01:41:40.139 align:start position:0%
you know there are so many people
 
01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
stacked up for every apartment that they
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
get to choose who's going to live in
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
that apartment
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
finally just aren't enough yes is there
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
a Red Line there okay 30 is a standard
 
01:41:55.070 --> 01:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
requirement but you know does the red
 
01:41:58.129 --> 01:41:58.139 align:start position:0%
line occur when it's forty percent fifty
 
01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
percent higher
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure
 
01:42:03.530 --> 01:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
um I think you know maybe legal aid
 
01:42:05.090 --> 01:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
might be able to answer that question a
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
little bit better but you know there are
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
people who are paying more than their um
 
01:42:11.689 --> 01:42:11.699 align:start position:0%
more than 30 percent of their income for
 
01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
housing if the landlord will allow it
 
01:42:16.850 --> 01:42:16.860 align:start position:0%
but it's difficult to find a landlord
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
who will do that for you
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question are
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
there questions for this Witness
 
01:42:26.570 --> 01:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative thank
 
01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:28.609 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative thank
you

01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:28.619 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you once again for the opportunity
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
to speak to you I introduced myself last
 
01:42:39.890 --> 01:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
last time I advocate for landlords
 
01:42:41.629 --> 01:42:41.639 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
01:42:45.229 --> 01:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
a large readership of around 3 400
 
01:42:47.570 --> 01:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
I believe that I can be fairly quick on
 
01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
this I know we're short on time with
 
01:42:51.410 --> 01:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
lots of bills to consider I want to
 
01:42:54.649 --> 01:42:54.659 align:start position:0%
assure you that as a landlord of 35
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
years and in contact with thousands of
 
01:43:00.410 --> 01:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
landlords that there is no landlord that
 
01:43:02.270 --> 01:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
like gets pleasure out of evicting
 
01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
tenants or wants to evict tenants a
 
01:43:07.370 --> 01:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
landlord does not want to evict a tenant
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's bad business it loses money it
 
01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.050 align:start position:0%
it's bad business it loses money it
creates

01:43:12.050 --> 01:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
creates
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
hardship for the tenant we don't want to
 
01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
do that and it creates hardship for the
 
01:43:19.810 --> 01:43:19.820 align:start position:0%
landlords with more maintenance costs
 
01:43:22.490 --> 01:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
advertising showing the property
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
there's no reason that we want to evict
 
01:43:25.850 --> 01:43:25.860 align:start position:0%
a tenant
 
01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
however as one of the previous speakers
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
did say sometimes there is a tenant that
 
01:43:32.450 --> 01:43:32.460 align:start position:0%
you don't want the tenancy to continue
 
01:43:35.689 --> 01:43:35.699 align:start position:0%
they may be causing a lot of trouble to
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
the neighboring tenants in the property
 
01:43:40.370 --> 01:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
there's quite a number of reasons that
 
01:43:42.649 --> 01:43:42.659 align:start position:0%
you may not want to con to continue a
 
01:43:47.930 --> 01:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
tendency so if this bill were to pass
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
what you would see
 
01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
I predict was that the only people that
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
would be affected by this
 
01:43:56.810 --> 01:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
are those
 
01:44:00.649 --> 01:44:00.659 align:start position:0%
bad tenants that are causing problems
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
or perhaps a friend's situation like was
 
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
mentioned over here that might be hard
 
01:44:09.050 --> 01:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:12.530 --> 01:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
the tenants I mean landlords just don't
 
01:44:19.370 --> 01:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.370 --> 01:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
the bill would as said create an actual
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
end to a lease and that's only
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable you enter a contract there
 
01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
there was a question over here about
 
01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
where's the red line
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
in our company and I think it's common
 
01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
for landlords Redline would be 50 of
 
01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:41.570 align:start position:0%
for landlords Redline would be 50 of
income

01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
like this really hard for someone to to
 
01:44:47.810 --> 01:44:47.820 align:start position:0%
afford to live and make it work in a
 
01:44:50.330 --> 01:44:50.340 align:start position:0%
long-term situation at 50 percent
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
but even in our company we don't say no
 
01:44:54.410 --> 01:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
at 50 percent
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
what we say at that level is if you want
 
01:44:59.810 --> 01:44:59.820 align:start position:0%
to live here and pay 50 or more of your
 
01:45:01.850 --> 01:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
income then you need to prove to us that
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
you can do that right you can submit to
 
01:45:07.129 --> 01:45:07.139 align:start position:0%
us a budget give us your history maybe
 
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
you're the kind of person that is really
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
good on saving and and can budget and
 
01:45:14.689 --> 01:45:14.699 align:start position:0%
make it work maybe you have made it work
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
but when I would say a property owner
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
sees more than 40
 
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
then that's like we're getting iffy here
 
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
can they really do it and 50 is most
 
01:45:26.930 --> 01:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
people can't actually
 
01:45:28.729 --> 01:45:28.739 align:start position:0%
but there's a few that can so we
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say no there
 
01:45:32.830 --> 01:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
I'm very happy to take any questions
 
01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:35.639 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
01:45:37.609 --> 01:45:37.619 align:start position:0%
yes representative Tripp
 
01:45:39.169 --> 01:45:39.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:45:39.179 --> 01:45:41.810 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
uh

01:45:41.810 --> 01:45:41.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.239 --> 01:45:47.410 align:start position:0%
 
what

01:45:47.410 --> 01:45:47.420 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
recourse do you have
 
01:45:53.209 --> 01:45:53.219 align:start position:0%
if other tenants are complaining about a
 
01:45:57.410 --> 01:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
tenant other than to uh
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
tell them they have to move out at the
 
01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
end of the lease it's a very tough
 
01:46:02.810 --> 01:46:02.820 align:start position:0%
situation for a landlord there's very
 
01:46:04.850 --> 01:46:04.860 align:start position:0%
little recourse at all
 
01:46:09.169 --> 01:46:09.179 align:start position:0%
so a landlord could attempt to evict the
 
01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
tenant on bad behavior
 
01:46:14.689 --> 01:46:14.699 align:start position:0%
it's possible that is legally allowed
 
01:46:18.169 --> 01:46:18.179 align:start position:0%
but to go to court to evict a tenant for
 
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
that situation
 
01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
you would have to prove the bad behavior
 
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
and usually I'm saying like almost
 
01:46:29.810 --> 01:46:29.820 align:start position:0%
always there is nobody in the property
 
01:46:31.729 --> 01:46:31.739 align:start position:0%
that's a neighboring tenant that would
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
testify in court and put themselves at
 
01:46:36.410 --> 01:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
risk in that way
 
01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:38.270 align:start position:0%
risk in that way
so

01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's very hard to get rid of a
 
01:46:43.129 --> 01:46:43.139 align:start position:0%
tenant that's causing disturbance or
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
whatever selling drugs or any of the
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
different bad behaviors that are are
 
01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:52.270 align:start position:0%
different bad behaviors that are are
there

01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:55.330 --> 01:46:55.340 align:start position:0%
one other answer to your question is
 
01:46:58.729 --> 01:46:58.739 align:start position:0%
if if you feel like you can't prove the
 
01:47:02.450 --> 01:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
bad behavior in that scenario an option
 
01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
and a lot of landlords will take it is
 
01:47:07.370 --> 01:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
to choose well I'm going to
 
01:47:09.770 --> 01:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
renovate this property into a more High
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
that's a valid reason to to evict a
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
tenant because you want to do a large
 
01:47:18.239 --> 01:47:19.910 align:start position:0%
tenant because you want to do a large
renovation

01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
renovation
 
01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:21.290 align:start position:0%
renovation
and

01:47:21.290 --> 01:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:23.090 --> 01:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
personally I think that's a really sad
 
01:47:25.310 --> 01:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
situation because now what you're doing
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
is you're forcing a landlord to take one
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
of those options that it reduces the
 
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
01:47:35.149 --> 01:47:35.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions for
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:40.729 --> 01:47:40.739 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:47:43.729 --> 01:47:43.739 align:start position:0%
um uh what con I hear you keep using the
 
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
term uh bad tenant and I want to know
 
01:47:49.729 --> 01:47:49.739 align:start position:0%
what constitutes a bad tenant
 
01:47:52.750 --> 01:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
bad tenants could be someone that has
 
01:47:54.830 --> 01:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
animals that they don't take care of
 
01:47:56.750 --> 01:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
their animals they're leaving dog poop
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
around the property and over their beds
 
01:48:01.129 --> 01:48:01.139 align:start position:0%
in the apartment that they haven't
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
cleaned up or strewn throughout the
 
01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
apartment or on the decks there's an
 
01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
example of a bad tenant a bad tenant
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
could be someone that's constantly
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
causing noise disturbance and not giving
 
01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
a place of quiet enjoyment to the
 
01:48:16.010 --> 01:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
neighboring tenants
 
01:48:17.689 --> 01:48:17.699 align:start position:0%
a bad tenant could be someone that's
 
01:48:19.370 --> 01:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
selling drugs and creating a lot of
 
01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
traffic in the building
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
many many other 10 bad tenant could be
 
01:48:25.609 --> 01:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
someone that's busting holes in the
 
01:48:27.649 --> 01:48:27.659 align:start position:0%
walls and creating damage
 
01:48:30.229 --> 01:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
a bad tenant these are things that I
 
01:48:32.450 --> 01:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
know of personally from myself or other
 
01:48:34.850 --> 01:48:34.860 align:start position:0%
landlords a bad tenant could be a tenant
 
01:48:36.290 --> 01:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
that's mad at the landlord for some
 
01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
reason and they turn on all of their
 
01:48:40.189 --> 01:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
Faucets in the apartment and stuff the
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
there's many many kinds of bad tenants
 
01:48:49.370 --> 01:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
way far more bad tenants than bad
 
01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:50.990 align:start position:0%
way far more bad tenants than bad
landlords

01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
landlords
 
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.550 align:start position:0%
landlords
right

01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:48:54.169 --> 01:48:54.179 align:start position:0%
further questions further questions for
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
this Witness
 
01:48:58.189 --> 01:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
yes representative Stapleton
 
01:49:00.169 --> 01:49:00.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
so you have a problem tenant that does
 
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
any number of things that you just
 
01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:07.010 align:start position:0%
any number of things that you just
described

01:49:07.010 --> 01:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
described
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
and the landlord says your route on the
 
01:49:12.770 --> 01:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
termination of the lease or if it's
 
01:49:14.510 --> 01:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
serious enough even before the
 
01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:15.649 align:start position:0%
serious enough even before the
termination

01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:15.659 align:start position:0%
termination
 
01:49:17.689 --> 01:49:17.699 align:start position:0%
and he says I'm and the Tenant says I'm
 
01:49:18.890 --> 01:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
not going
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
so you have a recourse to take your
 
01:49:25.129 --> 01:49:25.139 align:start position:0%
eviction complaint to the court uh how
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
costly and how long does that generally
 
01:49:29.570 --> 01:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
take is that a difficult proposition for
 
01:49:31.850 --> 01:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
a landlord thank you thank you for the
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
question there's two answers to the
 
01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:35.390 align:start position:0%
question there's two answers to the
question

01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
um the eviction process fairly quickly
 
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
devised down in two scenarios one is
 
01:49:41.870 --> 01:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
non-payment of rent
 
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
the other is all other sorts of bad
 
01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:46.070 align:start position:0%
the other is all other sorts of bad
behaviors

01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
behaviors
 
01:49:49.010 --> 01:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
if it's a non-payment of rent that's a
 
01:49:50.990 --> 01:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
fairly simple eviction to win for a
 
01:49:53.810 --> 01:49:53.820 align:start position:0%
landlord actually and that process
 
01:49:56.209 --> 01:49:56.219 align:start position:0%
usually takes about six to eight weeks
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
if the landlord is diligent at following
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
every step you know right after the last
 
01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
step ends and they haven't made any
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
mistakes clerical mistakes on the forms
 
01:50:11.689 --> 01:50:11.699 align:start position:0%
if it's for bad behavior of any of those
 
01:50:14.689 --> 01:50:14.699 align:start position:0%
different things the process takes an
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:22.430 --> 01:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
if you can actually prove those
 
01:50:25.790 --> 01:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
situations in court and usually it's
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
very difficult to prove those types of
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
allegations in court so is it real
 
01:50:33.290 --> 01:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
likely to actually lose the case after
 
01:50:37.250 --> 01:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
all of that in terms of costs the cost
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
of an eviction can run if you're doing
 
01:50:41.090 --> 01:50:41.100 align:start position:0%
it yourself
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
anywhere from maybe around two hundred
 
01:50:46.850 --> 01:50:46.860 align:start position:0%
dollars to four hundred dollars
 
01:50:49.790 --> 01:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
by the time you're done
 
01:50:52.189 --> 01:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of factors that change the
 
01:50:52.199 --> 01:50:53.450 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of factors that change the
cost

01:50:53.450 --> 01:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:51:00.250 --> 01:51:00.260 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
01:51:07.609 --> 01:51:07.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:09.410 --> 01:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you to the committee for
 
01:51:10.729 --> 01:51:10.739 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak my name is Stephen
 
01:51:12.530 --> 01:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
Quine again
 
01:51:14.209 --> 01:51:14.219 align:start position:0%
um I just want to reiterate turnover
 
01:51:16.370 --> 01:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
costs are very expensive for landlords
 
01:51:18.290 --> 01:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
we have to go in clean the apartment
 
01:51:20.330 --> 01:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
many times repaint it sometimes we have
 
01:51:22.189 --> 01:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
to change the flooring we don't want to
 
01:51:23.570 --> 01:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
be in the eviction business we want to
 
01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
be in the renting business and it's very
 
01:51:26.930 --> 01:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
rare we do it
 
01:51:29.870 --> 01:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
second of all under RSA 540 colon 2
 
01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
which is the landlord tenant statute
 
01:51:33.770 --> 01:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
dealing with evictions you have
 
01:51:36.050 --> 01:51:36.060 align:start position:0%
delineated certain things that are
 
01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
grounds for evictions and the problem is
 
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
there are times when you hit that spot
 
01:51:42.350 --> 01:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
where it doesn't meet one of those
 
01:51:44.930 --> 01:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
grounds and this bill gives us an option
 
01:51:47.450 --> 01:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
to get a bad tenant out who's not super
 
01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:48.470 align:start position:0%
to get a bad tenant out who's not super
bad

01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
bad
 
01:51:51.410 --> 01:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
I have one of those situations today I
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
use a management company to run the
 
01:51:55.010 --> 01:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
apartments tenants are supposed to call
 
01:51:57.169 --> 01:51:57.179 align:start position:0%
the management company out of the 40
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
units I have I have one who I never gave
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
a phone number to isn't supposed to call
 
01:52:03.470 --> 01:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
me got it from an old attendant before
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
we turned it over and calls me his next
 
01:52:10.129 --> 01:52:10.139 align:start position:0%
to last phone message starts hi dumb
 
01:52:10.139 --> 01:52:11.450 align:start position:0%
to last phone message starts hi dumb
slumlord

01:52:11.450 --> 01:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
slumlord
 
01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
he calls me threatened to call every day
 
01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
he hasn't he's threatened to contact all
 
01:52:18.770 --> 01:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
my tenants to talk about how bad I am
 
01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
trying to try and deal with me making
 
01:52:24.169 --> 01:52:24.179 align:start position:0%
economic threats against me he's
 
01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
degraded in many of the phone messages
 
01:52:28.250 --> 01:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
our management company
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh he's a pain it's a part of mildly but
 
01:52:33.410 --> 01:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
he doesn't destroy the property I can't
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
prove he's making these phone calls from
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
the property so then I don't have a
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
grounds for eviction that he might be
 
01:52:43.370 --> 01:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
creating or being involved in criminal
 
01:52:46.729 --> 01:52:46.739 align:start position:0%
activity of harassment phone calls and I
 
01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
really am going to have trouble getting
 
01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
him out and I need to get him out for my
 
01:52:52.129 --> 01:52:52.139 align:start position:0%
own peace of mind I finally had to block
 
01:52:54.410 --> 01:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
him sometimes so I could take care of
 
01:52:56.689 --> 01:52:56.699 align:start position:0%
some of my own personal things
 
01:52:58.910 --> 01:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
and the problem is I don't have a good
 
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
ground his lease is coming up we want to
 
01:53:03.649 --> 01:53:03.659 align:start position:0%
get rid of him we have to find something
 
01:53:05.810 --> 01:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
if this bill was in place I would be
 
01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
able to do it another advantage of this
 
01:53:11.149 --> 01:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
bill actually goes to the tenants that
 
01:53:14.209 --> 01:53:14.219 align:start position:0%
in an eviction process the first step is
 
01:53:15.890 --> 01:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
serving the tenant with an eviction
 
01:53:17.930 --> 01:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
notice and in the eviction notice you
 
01:53:20.810 --> 01:53:20.820 align:start position:0%
have to specify the grounds
 
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
non-payment rents easy
 
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
but in other cases we will have to
 
01:53:28.490 --> 01:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
allege if it's bad behavior that bad
 
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
behavior that document is a public
 
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
document any new landlord can get a hold
 
01:53:34.490 --> 01:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
of it any of the reporting Services
 
01:53:36.410 --> 01:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
regarding tenants can get a hold of it
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
and it could make it far harder for that
 
01:53:40.609 --> 01:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
tenant to find other housing in the
 
01:53:43.129 --> 01:53:43.139 align:start position:0%
future an eviction on a tenants record
 
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
is grounds in my mind to reject that
 
01:53:49.129 --> 01:53:49.139 align:start position:0%
tenant so that if we have this in place
 
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
lease is up he knows he has to get out
 
01:53:53.570 --> 01:53:53.580 align:start position:0%
he doesn't want an eviction
 
01:53:56.689 --> 01:53:56.699 align:start position:0%
he's gone helps him helps me
 
01:53:59.149 --> 01:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
and I think it's worth it to have this
 
01:54:02.209 --> 01:54:02.219 align:start position:0%
in place and we don't want to evict I
 
01:54:03.890 --> 01:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
know we're going to hear that landlord
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
is convict if they would be able to
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
evict if they don't like the tenant but
 
01:54:09.229 --> 01:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
it's very expensive it's not something
 
01:54:11.330 --> 01:54:11.340 align:start position:0%
we want to do and just understand I lose
 
01:54:13.070 --> 01:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
a month's rent right up front paying the
 
01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
management company to re-rent it if I do
 
01:54:16.970 --> 01:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
that and many other landlords are in the
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
same position or if you do it yourself
 
01:54:20.930 --> 01:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
you have your time energy screening all
 
01:54:23.209 --> 01:54:23.219 align:start position:0%
that involved so we're not out to evict
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
people we don't make money evicting
 
01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
people we lose money and overfest right
 
01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to testify all
 
01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
right thank you sir questions for this
 
01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
Witnesses yes representative mcbeath
 
01:54:36.649 --> 01:54:36.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Mr chair thank you Mr Klein
 
01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:40.380 align:start position:0%
um I think your testimony said that this
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
bill would allow you to get bad tenants
 
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
out where they didn't fit currently now
 
01:54:46.490 --> 01:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
the good cause
 
01:54:50.689 --> 01:54:50.699 align:start position:0%
um SEC sections are in 542.
 
01:54:50.699 --> 01:54:51.290 align:start position:0%
um SEC sections are in 542.
um

01:54:51.290 --> 01:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know unfortunately the tenant
 
01:54:55.970 --> 01:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
you're referencing you know is a jerk
 
01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
but jerks have rights unfortunately we
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
might not always want them to and um as
 
01:55:04.729 --> 01:55:04.739 align:start position:0%
I think the prime sponsor of this rule
 
01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
said maybe sometimes landlord tenants
 
01:55:08.450 --> 01:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
need to I mean landlords should get
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
legal advice because instead of evicting
 
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
this jerk maybe a civil restraining
 
01:55:15.890 --> 01:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
order which would not cost for 200 to
 
01:55:18.229 --> 01:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
500 would give you peace of a mind but
 
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
it still protects you said he was a good
 
01:55:21.770 --> 01:55:21.780 align:start position:0%
tenant right he said he's paying his
 
01:55:23.209 --> 01:55:23.219 align:start position:0%
bills and he's not bothering anyone
 
01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
there he's just bothering you so that
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
harassment could be
 
01:55:27.119 --> 01:55:27.890 align:start position:0%
harassment could be
um

01:55:27.890 --> 01:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know addressed appropriately
 
01:55:31.129 --> 01:55:31.139 align:start position:0%
through the law and not through trying
 
01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
to evict him yeah I I I looked at 540
 
01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
first of all the reference is 540 colon
 
01:55:39.709 --> 01:55:39.719 align:start position:0%
2 for the the grounds for eviction just
 
01:55:42.350 --> 01:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
to make that clear then we have the I
 
01:55:43.609 --> 01:55:43.619 align:start position:0%
call it the do's and don'ts of land
 
01:55:46.490 --> 01:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant law 540 hyphen a he doesn't
 
01:55:50.570 --> 01:55:50.580 align:start position:0%
fit in my mind the language of 540 hey
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
to give me that and in order to get such
 
01:55:55.070 --> 01:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
a civil restraining order I'd have to go
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
to Superior Court and get an injunction
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
against him which gets very expensive
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not one of these these
 
01:56:03.229 --> 01:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
little civil petitions that we can do in
 
01:56:03.239 --> 01:56:04.790 align:start position:0%
little civil petitions that we can do in
540A

01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
540A
 
01:56:06.649 --> 01:56:06.659 align:start position:0%
so it's it's more difficult than you're
 
01:56:06.659 --> 01:56:09.050 align:start position:0%
so it's it's more difficult than you're
saying

01:56:09.050 --> 01:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much sir
 
01:56:14.159 --> 01:56:14.810 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much sir
um

01:56:14.810 --> 01:56:14.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:26.930 --> 01:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.930 --> 01:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
yes Miss Morgan thank you good morning
 
01:56:32.030 --> 01:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
um Jessica Martinson again and I oppose
 
01:56:33.709 --> 01:56:33.719 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:56:36.890 --> 01:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
um for quite a few reasons I also
 
01:56:38.990 --> 01:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
brought up with me and I would hope
 
01:56:41.689 --> 01:56:41.699 align:start position:0%
everybody would take a look at RSA 540
 
01:56:44.209 --> 01:56:44.219 align:start position:0%
colon 2 or colon 2 termination of
 
01:56:47.330 --> 01:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
tenancy there's a myriad of multiple
 
01:56:49.729 --> 01:56:49.739 align:start position:0%
different ways that they can as they
 
01:56:51.950 --> 01:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
stated have an eviction
 
01:56:54.890 --> 01:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
um many of the ones I listen to there
 
01:56:56.930 --> 01:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
are plenty of reasons and someone asked
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
over here about
 
01:57:02.209 --> 01:57:02.219 align:start position:0%
um when they mentioned a I would like to
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
close my apartment I'm renting it out
 
01:57:05.629 --> 01:57:05.639 align:start position:0%
but I have a relative moving in well
 
01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
whether it's a friend a relative
 
01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that falls under other
 
01:57:11.930 --> 01:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
good cause of Sound business decision if
 
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
it's a sound business decision for you
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
you can evict and it's a horrible fear
 
01:57:19.790 --> 01:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
that tenants live under every day so
 
01:57:22.189 --> 01:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
adding another tool to their box to just
 
01:57:24.649 --> 01:57:24.659 align:start position:0%
casually evict someone in the state that
 
01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
we're in right now would be very
 
01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:28.490 align:start position:0%
we're in right now would be very
devastating

01:57:28.490 --> 01:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
devastating
 
01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:29.810 align:start position:0%
devastating
um

01:57:29.810 --> 01:57:29.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:33.770 --> 01:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
under this one this bill would be very
 
01:57:35.629 --> 01:57:35.639 align:start position:0%
unhealthy for our state it'd be very
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
costly and it creates instability and an
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
already unstable environment as stated
 
01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
previously multiple times like
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
Manchester our vacancy rates 0.3 our
 
01:57:50.810 --> 01:57:50.820 align:start position:0%
County Hillsborough is 0.4 not much
 
01:57:53.390 --> 01:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
better it takes my tenants on average
 
01:57:56.270 --> 01:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
six months to locate an apartment that
 
01:57:59.629 --> 01:57:59.639 align:start position:0%
they can secure those at 30 Ami area
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
median income and up to 50 Ami have way
 
01:58:05.089 --> 01:58:05.099 align:start position:0%
less options out there available to them
 
01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
for renting a lot of them are stuck
 
01:58:09.290 --> 01:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
currently in hotels in our state we have
 
01:58:12.290 --> 01:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
roughly 72 individuals and families in
 
01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
hotels majority of them because they
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
cannot find an apartment I have some
 
01:58:19.850 --> 01:58:19.860 align:start position:0%
clients with vouchers even they just
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
can't find an apartment so we don't want
 
01:58:24.290 --> 01:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
to take a situation as it is where it's
 
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
already hard to be housed and create
 
01:58:28.250 --> 01:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
something harder when we already have
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
plenty of safety
 
01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:31.189 align:start position:0%
plenty of safety
um

01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:33.410 --> 01:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
plenty of reasons in here a landlord
 
01:58:36.050 --> 01:58:36.060 align:start position:0%
could evict from anything from a safety
 
01:58:36.060 --> 01:58:37.430 align:start position:0%
could evict from anything from a safety
reason

01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:58:39.290 --> 01:58:39.300 align:start position:0%
um if the tenants not safe to be in
 
01:58:41.330 --> 01:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
there either to themselves or others if
 
01:58:43.310 --> 01:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
they're creating damage if they won't
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
let them in to do bug remediation
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
there's a myriad of reasons already
 
01:58:49.790 --> 01:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
other than the horrible one of other
 
01:58:53.629 --> 01:58:53.639 align:start position:0%
good cause so I strongly oppose this one
 
01:58:55.370 --> 01:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
let me make sure I'm not missing
 
01:58:55.380 --> 01:58:56.810 align:start position:0%
let me make sure I'm not missing
anything

01:58:56.810 --> 01:58:56.820 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:58:56.820 --> 01:58:58.910 align:start position:0%
anything
um

01:58:58.910 --> 01:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
yeah because if you look over it you'll
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
see rent due damage failure to comply
 
01:59:06.050 --> 01:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
with lease terms on safe Behavior other
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
good cause removal dwelling unit even if
 
01:59:10.250 --> 01:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
they want to just remove the dwelling
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
unit from there so I've seen many
 
01:59:15.290 --> 01:59:15.300 align:start position:0%
tenants that this would affect extremely
 
01:59:18.050 --> 01:59:18.060 align:start position:0%
adversely and it would affect a
 
01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
marginalized portion of the society much
 
01:59:24.050 --> 01:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
worse than another creating strain on
 
01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:25.250 align:start position:0%
worse than another creating strain on
other

01:59:25.250 --> 01:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
resources available to help them
 
01:59:29.570 --> 01:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
such as the homelessness that's been
 
01:59:31.070 --> 01:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
spoken about
 
01:59:34.729 --> 01:59:34.739 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this Witness
 
01:59:37.390 --> 01:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much mayor
 
01:59:48.050 --> 01:59:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
hey it's Brandon Lemay from Manchester
 
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh I am a tenant organizer
 
01:59:53.689 --> 01:59:53.699 align:start position:0%
with writes in democracy uh but speaking
 
01:59:55.790 --> 01:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
of my own behalf right here uh I'm
 
01:59:59.870 --> 01:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
speaking in opposition of Bill 117.
 
02:00:03.169 --> 02:00:03.179 align:start position:0%
uh and I want to put it shortly here I
 
02:00:06.169 --> 02:00:06.179 align:start position:0%
think that this bill would make it so
 
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
more law-abiding and least abiding
 
02:00:11.930 --> 02:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
tenants are going to get evicted
 
02:00:14.589 --> 02:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
and so we've heard some examples here
 
02:00:17.810 --> 02:00:17.820 align:start position:0%
and again we're all innocent until we're
 
02:00:20.109 --> 02:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
proven guilty in a court of law at least
 
02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
and if you can't prove that a crime is
 
02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
being committed and you can't prove that
 
02:00:28.250 --> 02:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
a lease term is being broken then what
 
02:00:30.410 --> 02:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
Merit is there at all
 
02:00:32.990 --> 02:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
again these are just like you can just
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
evict somebody on the suspicion that
 
02:00:37.129 --> 02:00:37.139 align:start position:0%
they might be breaking a law or they
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
might be breaking a lease term I would
 
02:00:41.089 --> 02:00:41.099 align:start position:0%
need to see something much more Concrete
 
02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
in order to justify that
 
02:00:46.729 --> 02:00:46.739 align:start position:0%
and one thing I wanted to add to uh for
 
02:00:48.589 --> 02:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
extra context uh somebody asked here
 
02:00:50.330 --> 02:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
about what landlords generally require
 
02:00:53.330 --> 02:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
for income my landlord requires uh no
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
more than rent to be 25 of my income I
 
02:00:58.550 --> 02:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
usually see it's between that and like
 
02:01:01.310 --> 02:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
one-third of your income and just to
 
02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
clear that up
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
um so yeah this bill would essentially
 
02:01:09.649 --> 02:01:09.659 align:start position:0%
make it would increase evictions at a
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
time when housing is not very available
 
02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
right now it's virtually a zero percent
 
02:01:16.070 --> 02:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
occupation occupancy rate it should be
 
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
about four to eight percent
 
02:01:20.510 --> 02:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh and I also want to add two evictions
 
02:01:22.910 --> 02:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
make it harder to find that next
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
apartment so again we could be evicting
 
02:01:29.330 --> 02:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
more lease and law-abiding tenants and
 
02:01:31.850 --> 02:01:31.860 align:start position:0%
then affect their ability negatively to
 
02:01:34.129 --> 02:01:34.139 align:start position:0%
get an apartment again all because they
 
02:01:35.810 --> 02:01:35.820 align:start position:0%
followed the law they paid the rent on
 
02:01:37.850 --> 02:01:37.860 align:start position:0%
time you know they picked up after their
 
02:01:40.850 --> 02:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
dog poop and you know
 
02:01:44.209 --> 02:01:44.219 align:start position:0%
um for For What and finally you know I I
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to imagine you know what is the
 
02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:49.310 align:start position:0%
wanted to imagine you know what is the
least

02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
least
 
02:01:51.530 --> 02:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say a bad landlord but
 
02:01:55.609 --> 02:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
what if my landlord was a Democrat and I
 
02:01:58.609 --> 02:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
am a Republican and my landlord can look
 
02:02:00.410 --> 02:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
up my registration
 
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
like like could they could they then oh
 
02:02:07.010 --> 02:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry well sorry could I could I
 
02:02:10.370 --> 02:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
could I rephrase that yes let's say my
 
02:02:12.169 --> 02:02:12.179 align:start position:0%
landlord has a different political
 
02:02:17.709 --> 02:02:17.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
this is not about anybody's political
 
02:02:24.410 --> 02:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
party preference and I object could I oh
 
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry sorry
 
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh okay
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
um what if my landlord is a Jets fan and
 
02:02:32.209 --> 02:02:32.219 align:start position:0%
I'm a Patriots fan and they want to
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
evict me just for that because of the
 
02:02:35.810 --> 02:02:35.820 align:start position:0%
sports team that I that I that that I
 
02:02:37.790 --> 02:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
root for
 
02:02:39.050 --> 02:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
I mean that could be a grounds for an
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
eviction under under this law
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
so if you mean if if the term of the
 
02:02:47.149 --> 02:02:47.159 align:start position:0%
lease was up it could be an aggressive
 
02:02:49.010 --> 02:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
yes yes yes
 
02:02:50.570 --> 02:02:50.580 align:start position:0%
um and also I want to say too um there's
 
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
a reference to saying that you know
 
02:02:54.890 --> 02:02:54.900 align:start position:0%
essentially as just cause exists right
 
02:02:58.490 --> 02:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
now leases are in perpetuity
 
02:03:01.129 --> 02:03:01.139 align:start position:0%
in effect but I want to say that housing
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
is a human need and even if my lease is
 
02:03:05.629 --> 02:03:05.639 align:start position:0%
up I still keep living in perpetuity
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
hopefully and I believe this bill would
 
02:03:10.189 --> 02:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
increase homelessness and the and
 
02:03:11.930 --> 02:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
negatively impact the ability of future
 
02:03:14.209 --> 02:03:14.219 align:start position:0%
folks to rent all right questions for
 
02:03:16.490 --> 02:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
this witness yes representative Wallace
 
02:03:18.050 --> 02:03:18.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
02:03:19.250 --> 02:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:03:22.250 --> 02:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
um you alleged that the evictions will
 
02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
um will may go up as a result of this
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
bill because you're having an eviction
 
02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
on your uh tenancy record wouldn't it
 
02:03:31.129 --> 02:03:31.139 align:start position:0%
make more sense for everybody to get
 
02:03:33.169 --> 02:03:33.179 align:start position:0%
along and say hey look the lease is up
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to go always individually
 
02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
and separately separately on our own
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
accord then you don't have the eviction
 
02:03:40.250 --> 02:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
the Orlando doesn't have to go through
 
02:03:41.810 --> 02:03:41.820 align:start position:0%
it and then there's no problems
 
02:03:43.609 --> 02:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
acquiring another property in the future
 
02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't that make more sense yes uh
 
02:03:46.689 --> 02:03:46.699 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:03:49.310 --> 02:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
representative I would say in a normal
 
02:03:51.290 --> 02:03:51.300 align:start position:0%
housing market you know if we had a
 
02:03:54.109 --> 02:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate of eight percent then in
 
02:03:56.089 --> 02:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
effect yeah I believe that could make
 
02:03:57.709 --> 02:03:57.719 align:start position:0%
the most sense for all parties involved
 
02:03:59.930 --> 02:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that tenants want to
 
02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
stay in a place where the landlord does
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
not want them to be there but
 
02:04:06.290 --> 02:04:06.300 align:start position:0%
circumstances virtually you know dictate
 
02:04:08.089 --> 02:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
that it's very hard to find that next
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
apartment and if I get an eviction then
 
02:04:13.550 --> 02:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
you know it like like a previous uh
 
02:04:15.050 --> 02:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
speaker said it could take up to six
 
02:04:16.729 --> 02:04:16.739 align:start position:0%
months to find a new apartment
 
02:04:19.550 --> 02:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
so you know renters are in a bind right
 
02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:21.109 align:start position:0%
so you know renters are in a bind right
now

02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative Perez
 
02:04:24.589 --> 02:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:27.649 --> 02:04:27.659 align:start position:0%
is there not a a difference between an
 
02:04:30.290 --> 02:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
eviction and not renewing your lease
 
02:04:33.530 --> 02:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
I mean it it seems to me that if I don't
 
02:04:35.810 --> 02:04:35.820 align:start position:0%
renew your lease I'm not evicting you
 
02:04:39.290 --> 02:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
I'm just not renewing your lease and if
 
02:04:42.050 --> 02:04:42.060 align:start position:0%
you are a good tenant and you do all the
 
02:04:43.609 --> 02:04:43.619 align:start position:0%
wonderful things that you're supposed to
 
02:04:45.950 --> 02:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
do and paying and picking up and this
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
and that why would and you think it's
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to be because you're a Jets
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:56.169 --> 02:04:56.179 align:start position:0%
I I think that's going a little deep
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
because if I'm a if I'm a landlord I'm
 
02:05:03.050 --> 02:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
not willing to have to put forward the
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
money that I would have to put forward
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
to find someone new just because you
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
don't like the Patriots Yeah
 
02:05:12.649 --> 02:05:12.659 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure well first thank you for
 
02:05:14.510 --> 02:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
the question representative
 
02:05:16.850 --> 02:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
um so I want to make sure that I answer
 
02:05:19.129 --> 02:05:19.139 align:start position:0%
your questions so are you asking is it
 
02:05:21.290 --> 02:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
not an eviction if you don't want to
 
02:05:22.970 --> 02:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
renew the lease
 
02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
so under current definition that is that
 
02:05:27.290 --> 02:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
is an eviction
 
02:05:28.669 --> 02:05:28.679 align:start position:0%
um that's also not good cause right
 
02:05:28.679 --> 02:05:30.050 align:start position:0%
um that's also not good cause right
there

02:05:30.050 --> 02:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:05:30.060 --> 02:05:30.770 align:start position:0%
there
um

02:05:30.770 --> 02:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
and I I want to apologize I don't know
 
02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
if I fully understood the nature of your
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
question there
 
02:05:40.430 --> 02:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to know if you know what
 
02:05:43.609 --> 02:05:43.619 align:start position:0%
do you think would be the the motive of
 
02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
a landlord wanting to
 
02:05:49.850 --> 02:05:49.860 align:start position:0%
not renew your lease if you were all
 
02:05:52.070 --> 02:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
these wonderful you know the perfect
 
02:05:55.550 --> 02:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
tenant I mean do we not assume that that
 
02:05:58.570 --> 02:05:58.580 align:start position:0%
landlord would want to keep you there
 
02:06:01.070 --> 02:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
you know the W no is better than the
 
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
devil you don't or that type of thing
 
02:06:04.970 --> 02:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
okay yeah no thank you for that question
 
02:06:06.169 --> 02:06:06.179 align:start position:0%
and thank you for clarifying and I
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
apologize for my confusion there
 
02:06:10.550 --> 02:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
um I would say yeah like a rationally
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
acting landlord
 
02:06:15.470 --> 02:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
um would conduct in that manner and I
 
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
would hope that most landlords in this
 
02:06:18.350 --> 02:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
room would generally agree with that
 
02:06:20.689 --> 02:06:20.699 align:start position:0%
sentiment unfortunately
 
02:06:22.250 --> 02:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
um the majority of the landlords that
 
02:06:25.129 --> 02:06:25.139 align:start position:0%
you know the the problem landlords
 
02:06:26.570 --> 02:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
um are not necessarily the most rational
 
02:06:30.050 --> 02:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
actors in my opinion there and sometimes
 
02:06:31.970 --> 02:06:31.980 align:start position:0%
just personal disputes just get in the
 
02:06:34.729 --> 02:06:34.739 align:start position:0%
way of a rational business decision
 
02:06:36.770 --> 02:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
02:06:38.810 --> 02:06:38.820 align:start position:0%
greeson thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
for answering our questions the purpose
 
02:06:44.689 --> 02:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
of a contract is to establish mutually
 
02:06:46.669 --> 02:06:46.679 align:start position:0%
agreed terms
 
02:06:49.370 --> 02:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
and they protect both parties it's
 
02:06:51.890 --> 02:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
designed to protect you the tenant and
 
02:06:53.089 --> 02:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
the landlord
 
02:06:56.450 --> 02:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
both parties are supposed to abide by
 
02:06:59.270 --> 02:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
the terms of the contract this bill is
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
only dealing with the end of the
 
02:07:05.330 --> 02:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
contract okay so after the contract is
 
02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:06.890 align:start position:0%
contract okay so after the contract is
up

02:07:06.890 --> 02:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
what obligations does the landlord have
 
02:07:12.770 --> 02:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
to you the tenant
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:19.970 --> 02:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
are is the landlord are you is the
 
02:07:22.430 --> 02:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
landlord still required to abide by
 
02:07:24.649 --> 02:07:24.659 align:start position:0%
whatever those terms of the contract are
 
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
02:07:32.450 --> 02:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
representative um so the answer is both
 
02:07:34.250 --> 02:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
parties are still like their their
 
02:07:35.689 --> 02:07:35.699 align:start position:0%
obligations are still to uphold both
 
02:07:38.270 --> 02:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
ends of the contract so me as a tenant I
 
02:07:40.970 --> 02:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
would then have to keep paying my rent I
 
02:07:42.050 --> 02:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
would have to keep respecting the
 
02:07:44.330 --> 02:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
property the landlord still provides you
 
02:07:46.669 --> 02:07:46.679 align:start position:0%
know a basic quality of housing I would
 
02:07:49.490 --> 02:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
also say two that I want to emphasize
 
02:07:52.669 --> 02:07:52.679 align:start position:0%
that housing is a human need and I would
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
argue too it's a public good so I also
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize too that there are
 
02:07:57.890 --> 02:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
broader implications outside of just
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
this contract but also in again such a
 
02:08:04.430 --> 02:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
low vacancy rate I mean there are
 
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
negative implications for tenants there
 
02:08:07.490 --> 02:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
are negative implications for the
 
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
community at large and sorry about that
 
02:08:13.970 --> 02:08:13.980 align:start position:0%
I'll no go ahead no I I see yeah hang on
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%

Hampshire legal assistance and I'm here
 
02:08:55.250 --> 02:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to this bill I will
 
02:08:57.649 --> 02:08:57.659 align:start position:0%
try my hardest to answer some of the
 
02:08:59.689 --> 02:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
questions regarding a eviction process
 
02:09:02.089 --> 02:09:02.099 align:start position:0%
that seemed to have come up over the
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
past few minutes we've been discussing
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
this and my colleague will be passing
 
02:09:07.370 --> 02:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
around a couple of handouts which
 
02:09:10.729 --> 02:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
include the eviction form that landlords
 
02:09:14.030 --> 02:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
can use when they are seeking to evict a
 
02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
tenant and it lists uh both the reasons
 
02:09:20.810 --> 02:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
and the time frame that's required just
 
02:09:22.189 --> 02:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
so that you have an opportunity to look
 
02:09:23.930 --> 02:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
at what they're working with
 
02:09:26.270 --> 02:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
I want to start by saying that on the
 
02:09:30.169 --> 02:09:30.179 align:start position:0%
face of this bill it looks pretty benign
 
02:09:32.810 --> 02:09:32.820 align:start position:0%
I think that if we were living in a time
 
02:09:35.510 --> 02:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
and a place where there was sufficient
 
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
housing all landlords were good actors
 
02:09:40.490 --> 02:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
and landlords and tenants had equal
 
02:09:42.050 --> 02:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
bargaining power
 
02:09:43.490 --> 02:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
I think that many of us would be
 
02:09:45.770 --> 02:09:45.780 align:start position:0%
hard-pressed to disagree but we're not
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
living in that time and place
 
02:09:50.470 --> 02:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
we're living in a time and place when
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
housing prices are at an all-time high
 
02:09:55.310 --> 02:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
vacancy is at an all-time low you've
 
02:09:56.810 --> 02:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
heard the statistic so I won't go
 
02:09:59.570 --> 02:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
through them again the one I will add is
 
02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
that over 30 000 households in New
 
02:10:04.609 --> 02:10:04.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are spending over half their
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh half their income on rent
 
02:10:10.189 --> 02:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
it is harder to get an apartment right
 
02:10:13.970 --> 02:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
now which makes it easier for a landlord
 
02:10:16.129 --> 02:10:16.139 align:start position:0%
to require a greater income
 
02:10:18.109 --> 02:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
so let's say a tenant has been renting
 
02:10:21.890 --> 02:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:23.570 --> 02:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
and when they got that apartment there
 
02:10:25.850 --> 02:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
was a much higher vacancy rate a healthy
 
02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
a healthy housing economy has about a
 
02:10:31.189 --> 02:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
five percent vacancy rate that's a rate
 
02:10:33.589 --> 02:10:33.599 align:start position:0%
in which people are able to move
 
02:10:36.109 --> 02:10:36.119 align:start position:0%
relatively seamlessly from one place to
 
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
another without disrupting their lives
 
02:10:40.970 --> 02:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
as you've heard we have a basic a 0.5 to
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
a point three percent vacancy rate in
 
02:10:44.810 --> 02:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right now
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
so four or five years ago you could get
 
02:10:49.790 --> 02:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
an apartment with having you know fifty
 
02:10:52.490 --> 02:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
percent of your income going toward your
 
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
rent that's not possible anymore
 
02:10:57.050 --> 02:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
so a person who was able to get that
 
02:10:59.089 --> 02:10:59.099 align:start position:0%
apartment has been able to make that
 
02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
work has been paying their rent has been
 
02:11:04.129 --> 02:11:04.139 align:start position:0%
complying with lease terms has been a
 
02:11:07.310 --> 02:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
good neighbor this bill would make it
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
possible for them to be evicted for
 
02:11:12.470 --> 02:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
doing nothing wrong and then place them
 
02:11:15.410 --> 02:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
in a housing market where they're simply
 
02:11:17.209 --> 02:11:17.219 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to find a place to
 
02:11:17.219 --> 02:11:18.109 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to find a place to
go

02:11:18.109 --> 02:11:18.119 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
I have clients who have looked for
 
02:11:23.390 --> 02:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
apartments for six months to a year and
 
02:11:24.890 --> 02:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
then ended up leaving the state because
 
02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
they couldn't find anything
 
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
in the last three weeks I've had two
 
02:11:30.890 --> 02:11:30.900 align:start position:0%
clients tell me that they're not going
 
02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
to bother looking because they can't
 
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
the good cause law that was passed and
 
02:11:40.970 --> 02:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
that was used in the case that was
 
02:11:43.970 --> 02:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
referenced uh and that was the formation
 
02:11:46.850 --> 02:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
of this bill was meant to balance the
 
02:11:49.089 --> 02:11:49.099 align:start position:0%
risks and
 
02:11:52.669 --> 02:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
the rights of both the the interests and
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
harms of both the property owners and
 
02:11:58.070 --> 02:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
the tenants it was to find a way for
 
02:12:00.410 --> 02:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
tenants to have some rights and some
 
02:12:02.209 --> 02:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
protection some stability
 
02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
and also allow Property Owners the
 
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
for good reason be able to use their
 
02:12:11.930 --> 02:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
property in a way that they desire
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
which is why good cause exists because
 
02:12:17.570 --> 02:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
any legitimate business reason economic
 
02:12:17.580 --> 02:12:18.370 align:start position:0%
any legitimate business reason economic
reason

02:12:18.370 --> 02:12:18.380 align:start position:0%
reason
 
02:12:20.930 --> 02:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
constitutes good costs if you want to
 
02:12:23.570 --> 02:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
take the it off the housing market you
 
02:12:25.790 --> 02:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
can do that if you want to rent to your
 
02:12:29.410 --> 02:12:29.420 align:start position:0%
uh your your daughter you can do that
 
02:12:32.750 --> 02:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
there are very many reasons that you can
 
02:12:34.729 --> 02:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
evict a tenant
 
02:12:37.550 --> 02:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
this is just making it so that you don't
 
02:12:40.970 --> 02:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:42.830 --> 02:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
Cornell you're you're kind of over your
 
02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
time so can you can I ask you to sum up
 
02:12:48.950 --> 02:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:51.050 --> 02:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
in an effort not to reiterate what
 
02:12:53.930 --> 02:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
others have said I'll just say that this
 
02:12:56.569 --> 02:12:56.579 align:start position:0%
bill will essentially create a practice
 
02:12:59.270 --> 02:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
or could create a practice of a series
 
02:13:01.250 --> 02:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
of six months
 
02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
tendencies that are essentially
 
02:13:03.119 --> 02:13:04.609 align:start position:0%
tendencies that are essentially
probationary

02:13:04.609 --> 02:13:04.619 align:start position:0%
probationary
 
02:13:07.069 --> 02:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
a stable housing is not going to become
 
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
available for folks who are not
 
02:13:10.669 --> 02:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to own property in this
 
02:13:12.649 --> 02:13:12.659 align:start position:0%
state and that the detrimental to
 
02:13:14.750 --> 02:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
low-income tenants and a detrimental to
 
02:13:16.189 --> 02:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
renters overall
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions that the
 
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
committee may have questions for this
 
02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:21.709 align:start position:0%
committee may have questions for this
Witness

02:13:21.709 --> 02:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
02:13:25.490 --> 02:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
under the current law couldn't a
 
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
landlord just
 
02:13:32.810 --> 02:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
raise the cost of the rent exponentially
 
02:13:34.850 --> 02:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
to make the tenant leave anyway if they
 
02:13:36.770 --> 02:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
wanted them to leave yes
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
they have to give 30 days notice for a
 
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
rental increase
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
as the law currently stands
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:13:47.330 --> 02:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
other question representative Greece
 
02:13:48.890 --> 02:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
Greece okay
 
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:13:52.010 --> 02:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
answering our questions
 
02:13:55.510 --> 02:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
if the landlord wants to raise the rent
 
02:13:58.550 --> 02:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
when are they allowed to raise the rent
 
02:14:00.530 --> 02:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
they are allowed to raise the rent
 
02:14:03.050 --> 02:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
outside of a rental period so let's say
 
02:14:05.390 --> 02:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
that the termination say there's a
 
02:14:08.030 --> 02:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
12-month lease and that 12-month lease
 
02:14:11.390 --> 02:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
is up in January so and this goes to the
 
02:14:14.030 --> 02:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
perpetuity issue as well so it is true
 
02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
that it's a contract for 12 months the
 
02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
terms of that contract renegotiated at
 
02:14:22.189 --> 02:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
the 12-month Mark so if you're 12 months
 
02:14:24.109 --> 02:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
is up in January you can say to the
 
02:14:26.330 --> 02:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
tenant if you want to stay I want you to
 
02:14:28.310 --> 02:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
sign a new lease and the new lease calls
 
02:14:31.550 --> 02:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
for this amount of rent and the Tenant
 
02:14:33.950 --> 02:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
can say okay I'll pay that amount in
 
02:14:35.689 --> 02:14:35.699 align:start position:0%
brand or any other lease provision you
 
02:14:38.450 --> 02:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
may want to add or or change or they can
 
02:14:41.569 --> 02:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
say no and they can move on on their way
 
02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
without having to go through the court
 
02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:43.910 align:start position:0%
without having to go through the court
process

02:14:43.910 --> 02:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
follow up please sir yes follow and and
 
02:14:48.350 --> 02:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
with that though what what you've
 
02:14:50.990 --> 02:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
omitted is the fact that if the tenant
 
02:14:53.450 --> 02:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
you you say if if the tenant agrees they
 
02:14:55.609 --> 02:14:55.619 align:start position:0%
can stay they can sign the new lease or
 
02:14:58.669 --> 02:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
they could say no and they can move out
 
02:15:00.649 --> 02:15:00.659 align:start position:0%
but that's the end of the of the of the
 
02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
lease agreement what if the tenant just
 
02:15:03.589 --> 02:15:03.599 align:start position:0%
says I don't want to sign a new lease
 
02:15:05.810 --> 02:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to go and that's what
 
02:15:07.609 --> 02:15:07.619 align:start position:0%
this is dealing with the the landlord
 
02:15:09.890 --> 02:15:09.900 align:start position:0%
does not have any way of saying I don't
 
02:15:11.390 --> 02:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
want you to stay I don't want to renew
 
02:15:13.729 --> 02:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
the lease why do I have to provide a
 
02:15:15.709 --> 02:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
different reason other than we're at the
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
end of the lease and there are no terms
 
02:15:20.209 --> 02:15:20.219 align:start position:0%
by which I want to sign a new lease
 
02:15:22.069 --> 02:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
I mean I got lost at the end of your
 
02:15:24.589 --> 02:15:24.599 align:start position:0%
question there's no terms that so you as
 
02:15:26.330 --> 02:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
the landlord I can't raise I can't raise
 
02:15:28.609 --> 02:15:28.619 align:start position:0%
the rent until the end of the of the of
 
02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
the of the lease yes I can't change any
 
02:15:32.330 --> 02:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
of the terms of the lease during the
 
02:15:34.189 --> 02:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
term of the lease correct so I have to
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
wait until the end of the lease period
 
02:15:38.089 --> 02:15:38.099 align:start position:0%
to do anything at all the only thing I
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
can't do
 
02:15:41.689 --> 02:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
is kick you out at the end of the lease
 
02:15:43.490 --> 02:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
period because it's up so to be clear
 
02:15:47.330 --> 02:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
you can evict a tenant for cause Okay
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
this bill is only dealing with the end
 
02:15:56.229 --> 02:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:58.729 --> 02:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
you're talking over each other so you've
 
02:16:00.229 --> 02:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
asked a question I apologize finish your
 
02:16:02.330 --> 02:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
answer all right so this yes this is
 
02:16:04.490 --> 02:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
about the ending of a lease term at the
 
02:16:05.810 --> 02:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
end of a lease term at the end of any
 
02:16:07.850 --> 02:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
contract you can renegotiate terms
 
02:16:09.290 --> 02:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
there's a distinction between
 
02:16:11.689 --> 02:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
renegotiating terms and ending the
 
02:16:14.089 --> 02:16:14.099 align:start position:0%
contract there are reasons that you can
 
02:16:16.850 --> 02:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
end the contract and so far as this that
 
02:16:21.589 --> 02:16:21.599 align:start position:0%
are provided by in RSA 542 if you want
 
02:16:22.910 --> 02:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
to raise the rent if you want to
 
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
renovate if you want to do any of those
 
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
economic reasons you can terminate the
 
02:16:29.089 --> 02:16:29.099 align:start position:0%
contract if the tenant won't agree to
 
02:16:31.129 --> 02:16:31.139 align:start position:0%
the raise fund the attendant doesn't
 
02:16:32.690 --> 02:16:32.700 align:start position:0%
have to agree to you being able to
 
02:16:34.969 --> 02:16:34.979 align:start position:0%
renovate the property there are many
 
02:16:37.549 --> 02:16:37.559 align:start position:0%
ways that you have the ability if you
 
02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599 align:start position:0%
have a valid reason for wanting that
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
tenant out if you don't have a reason
 
02:16:44.089 --> 02:16:44.099 align:start position:0%
it's true because tenants need some
 
02:16:46.250 --> 02:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
rights also they need to have some
 
02:16:48.530 --> 02:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
protection that if they're doing what
 
02:16:50.150 --> 02:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to do if they're being
 
02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
a good tenant as keeps being referred to
 
02:16:54.410 --> 02:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
they have some protection and under the
 
02:16:56.330 --> 02:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
law to ensure that they're going to be
 
02:16:58.250 --> 02:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
able to keep their job keep their kid in
 
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
the same school district live a stable
 
02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
life that everybody I believe deserves
 
02:17:05.810 --> 02:17:05.820 align:start position:0%
to have
 
02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
question representative Horgan
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
you mentioned tenants are moving out of
 
02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:11.929 align:start position:0%
you mentioned tenants are moving out of
States

02:17:11.929 --> 02:17:11.939 align:start position:0%
States
 
02:17:11.939 --> 02:17:12.589 align:start position:0%
States
um

02:17:12.589 --> 02:17:12.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:15.049 --> 02:17:15.059 align:start position:0%
rather because of the housing crisis so
 
02:17:16.250 --> 02:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
where are some of the other places
 
02:17:19.370 --> 02:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
they're going uh I've had tenants
 
02:17:20.629 --> 02:17:20.639 align:start position:0%
telling me that they're moving to
 
02:17:22.750 --> 02:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania to Maryland
 
02:17:25.209 --> 02:17:25.219 align:start position:0%
many of them are moving to Massachusetts
 
02:17:27.589 --> 02:17:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh had a couple tell me they're going to
 
02:17:30.410 --> 02:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
Maine so it's kind of I think either
 
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
where they can find a place or where
 
02:17:33.950 --> 02:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
maybe they have another family member
 
02:17:35.389 --> 02:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
someone who can help them get a place
 
02:17:37.730 --> 02:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
there all right so there's a follow-up
 
02:17:39.770 --> 02:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
so they're so desperate they're willing
 
02:17:42.110 --> 02:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
to forego the fact we're ranked number
 
02:17:44.030 --> 02:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
one for Freedom have no income or sales
 
02:17:47.509 --> 02:17:47.519 align:start position:0%
tax is that a question yes so they're
 
02:17:49.549 --> 02:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
willing to foregro all the wonderful
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
things we like to talk about here in New
 
02:17:53.870 --> 02:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in order to live in one of
 
02:17:56.089 --> 02:17:56.099 align:start position:0%
those States I would say that they're
 
02:17:57.530 --> 02:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
put in a position where they have to
 
02:18:00.009 --> 02:18:00.019 align:start position:0%
forego not that they are willing to
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth you had a
 
02:18:04.129 --> 02:18:04.139 align:start position:0%
question I believe thank you
 
02:18:06.049 --> 02:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I just
 
02:18:08.089 --> 02:18:08.099 align:start position:0%
want to be clear regarding your
 
02:18:11.209 --> 02:18:11.219 align:start position:0%
testimony the um the bill would not
 
02:18:14.089 --> 02:18:14.099 align:start position:0%
remove landlord's requirement to find
 
02:18:16.730 --> 02:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
good cause not only in the 13th month of
 
02:18:18.650 --> 02:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
the end of the lease but from the 13th
 
02:18:18.660 --> 02:18:19.549 align:start position:0%
the end of the lease but from the 13th
month

02:18:19.549 --> 02:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
month
 
02:18:21.230 --> 02:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
to as long as the tenant was in the
 
02:18:24.770 --> 02:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
building that's correct so a good any of
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
the enumerated reasons for eviction or
 
02:18:31.669 --> 02:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
good cause has to be given at the in any
 
02:18:33.290 --> 02:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
circumstance whether or not there's a
 
02:18:35.209 --> 02:18:35.219 align:start position:0%
lease the way the law functions now is
 
02:18:37.009 --> 02:18:37.019 align:start position:0%
that if nothing happens at the end of a
 
02:18:38.810 --> 02:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
lease term then it presumes a
 
02:18:40.490 --> 02:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
month-to-month tendency thereafter the
 
02:18:42.110 --> 02:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
same lease terms as were originally
 
02:18:44.570 --> 02:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
agreed to continue to apply as do the
 
02:18:45.889 --> 02:18:45.899 align:start position:0%
same requirements under the eviction
 
02:18:48.169 --> 02:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
statute thank you other questions for
 
02:18:50.270 --> 02:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
this Witness
 
02:18:53.330 --> 02:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry a representative
 
02:18:55.669 --> 02:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
yeah and thanks for taking the questions
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh this has brought up something
 
02:18:57.120 --> 02:18:58.429 align:start position:0%
uh this has brought up something
interesting

02:18:58.429 --> 02:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
02:19:00.830 --> 02:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
um I think in the preview from what I've
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
heard from previous uh Witnesses
 
02:19:06.410 --> 02:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
this there's been a lot of talk about
 
02:19:09.349 --> 02:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
that this law would basically preclude
 
02:19:11.690 --> 02:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
the need for an eviction
 
02:19:13.190 --> 02:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
um and that there would be no eviction
 
02:19:15.049 --> 02:19:15.059 align:start position:0%
put on record
 
02:19:15.059 --> 02:19:16.250 align:start position:0%
put on record
um

02:19:16.250 --> 02:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding if I read this is that
 
02:19:22.790 --> 02:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
this is predicated on a tenant that does
 
02:19:25.849 --> 02:19:25.859 align:start position:0%
not want to go voluntarily at the end of
 
02:19:28.969 --> 02:19:28.979 align:start position:0%
their their lease term and so
 
02:19:31.610 --> 02:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
is this creating a new cause for
 
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
eviction or is it removing eviction
 
02:19:37.310 --> 02:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
because it seems like even if this were
 
02:19:39.709 --> 02:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
in place you would still need to go
 
02:19:40.969 --> 02:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
through an eviction process because
 
02:19:42.709 --> 02:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
you've still got a tenant that doesn't
 
02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
want to leave is that correct yes that's
 
02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
correct so the way that the eviction law
 
02:19:49.730 --> 02:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire works is that you can
 
02:19:51.170 --> 02:19:51.180 align:start position:0%
negotiate with the tenant which I always
 
02:19:53.090 --> 02:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
encourage all of my clients to do to
 
02:19:55.310 --> 02:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
come to an agreement if the tenant does
 
02:19:57.050 --> 02:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
not want to leave and the landlord wants
 
02:19:58.370 --> 02:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
them to leave they have to use the
 
02:20:01.130 --> 02:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
lawful eviction process which requires a
 
02:20:03.710 --> 02:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
notice depend of a period of time
 
02:20:05.889 --> 02:20:05.899 align:start position:0%
depending on the reason for the eviction
 
02:20:08.450 --> 02:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
and then if the tenant has not vacated
 
02:20:10.370 --> 02:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
at the end of that notice period Then
 
02:20:12.710 --> 02:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
the court process begins and that's when
 
02:20:14.929 --> 02:20:14.939 align:start position:0%
an eviction goes on a tenant's record so
 
02:20:16.969 --> 02:20:16.979 align:start position:0%
can I ask one quick quality of course so
 
02:20:18.830 --> 02:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
in the form that you gave out which
 
02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
lists the existing reasons for eviction
 
02:20:23.929 --> 02:20:23.939 align:start position:0%
would this in would there need to be an
 
02:20:26.090 --> 02:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
additional step where this actually gets
 
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
added as a further
 
02:20:32.330 --> 02:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
um cause for this form so that you could
 
02:20:33.469 --> 02:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
say all right these are the other
 
02:20:35.450 --> 02:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
reasons you could evict and now the new
 
02:20:38.330 --> 02:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
cause is the lease is lapsed or
 
02:20:39.650 --> 02:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
something like that so yeah it would as
 
02:20:41.690 --> 02:20:41.700 align:start position:0%
it would as a cause it would add a cause
 
02:20:43.730 --> 02:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
for eviction
 
02:20:46.550 --> 02:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
um at the end of a lease term
 
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay because I'm not sure that I
 
02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
understand that that that's what's in
 
02:20:52.370 --> 02:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:56.090 --> 02:20:56.100 align:start position:0%

02:21:48.410 --> 02:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
together of a lot of landlord and tenant
 
02:21:50.330 --> 02:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
interests to create that stabilization
 
02:21:52.969 --> 02:21:52.979 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
02:21:54.889 --> 02:21:54.899 align:start position:0%
um and so we feel like we've played a
 
02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
role in making sure that the kind of
 
02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
business of being a landlord uh stayed a
 
02:22:01.610 --> 02:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
very strong business throughout the
 
02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
pandemic and we avoided that
 
02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
um perfect storm or the eviction tsunami
 
02:22:09.889 --> 02:22:09.899 align:start position:0%
that so many experts were predicting
 
02:22:09.899 --> 02:22:10.670 align:start position:0%
that so many experts were predicting
um

02:22:10.670 --> 02:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:13.070 --> 02:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
as these programs are starting to wind
 
02:22:16.910 --> 02:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
down now we urge policy makers to avoid
 
02:22:19.309 --> 02:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
making any policy changes that would
 
02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
exacerbate as you know a very fragile
 
02:22:25.490 --> 02:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
housing landscape in our state
 
02:22:28.250 --> 02:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
um I had the opportunity to have a kind
 
02:22:31.730 --> 02:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
of preview of the new housing Statewide
 
02:22:34.490 --> 02:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
needs assessment that has been funded
 
02:22:37.610 --> 02:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
and I will say that all the data here is
 
02:22:39.650 --> 02:22:39.660 align:start position:0%
just the the new set of numbers coming
 
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
out are much worse the the data is very
 
02:22:44.450 --> 02:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
sobering there's virtually no rental
 
02:22:47.450 --> 02:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
housing available for the typical renter
 
02:22:50.030 --> 02:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
near the job centers and so we believe
 
02:22:52.429 --> 02:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
that a policy like this as policymakers
 
02:22:55.190 --> 02:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
kind of putting your finger on this and
 
02:22:58.570 --> 02:22:58.580 align:start position:0%
and opening up a new door for evictions
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
will undoubtedly challenge the New
 
02:23:02.809 --> 02:23:02.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy and increase
 
02:23:02.819 --> 02:23:04.550 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy and increase
homelessness

02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
02:23:06.830 --> 02:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
and has been said many times you know
 
02:23:09.650 --> 02:23:09.660 align:start position:0%
RSA 540 already protects a lot of
 
02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
landlords interests now note that the
 
02:23:15.290 --> 02:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
chairman articulated
 
02:23:17.870 --> 02:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
um you know a desire to overturn
 
02:23:21.830 --> 02:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
established precedent and and as um New
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance just
 
02:23:25.969 --> 02:23:25.979 align:start position:0%
testified on its face there there seems
 
02:23:27.950 --> 02:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
to be it seems to be benign there seems
 
02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
to be a sense of fairness a sense of
 
02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
contract law we entered into this
 
02:23:34.429 --> 02:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
agreement it came to the end
 
02:23:38.210 --> 02:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
um but as you also noted Mr chair
 
02:23:40.730 --> 02:23:40.740 align:start position:0%
um there are practical implications to
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
to this and we even heard practitioners
 
02:23:46.610 --> 02:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
in the field say that they would use
 
02:23:49.250 --> 02:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
this law to open the door to evicting
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
tenants that they just don't like and so
 
02:23:55.130 --> 02:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
we don't encourage our policy makers to
 
02:23:57.469 --> 02:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
be making this chain change particularly
 
02:23:59.929 --> 02:23:59.939 align:start position:0%
at this time of crisis
 
02:24:02.389 --> 02:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
you know inexpedient to legislate is a
 
02:24:06.230 --> 02:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
term of art but it does seem like now is
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
really not the time to change uh the law
 
02:24:11.809 --> 02:24:11.819 align:start position:0%
given the crisis that our state is
 
02:24:13.849 --> 02:24:13.859 align:start position:0%
facing thank you I'll conclude my
 
02:24:15.469 --> 02:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
testimony happy to take any questions
 
02:24:18.290 --> 02:24:18.300 align:start position:0%
for this Witness
 
02:24:22.190 --> 02:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:25.070 --> 02:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who desires to
 
02:24:29.090 --> 02:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
testify on HP 117.
 
02:24:31.010 --> 02:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
 
02:24:34.130 --> 02:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
hearing on that and we will turn to the
 
02:24:39.530 --> 02:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:50.210 --> 02:24:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:53.630 --> 02:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
give me one second tap right and
 
02:24:53.640 --> 02:25:14.590 align:start position:0%
give me one second tap right and
um

02:25:14.590 --> 02:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:48.050 --> 02:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:50.210 --> 02:25:50.220 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair and thank you members
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
of the Judiciary Committee
 
02:26:03.830 --> 02:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Charlotte dilorenzo I
 
02:26:06.710 --> 02:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
am from Newmarket and I represent new
 
02:26:09.889 --> 02:26:09.899 align:start position:0%
marketer newfields uh in Rockingham
 
02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
District 10.
 
02:26:14.510 --> 02:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
so the bill that we have before us
 
02:26:19.010 --> 02:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
is to establish a commission to study
 
02:26:21.010 --> 02:26:21.020 align:start position:0%
the expansion of the landlord tenant
 
02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
mediation program in circuit courts
 
02:26:27.530 --> 02:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
Now The Spill
 
02:26:27.540 --> 02:26:28.429 align:start position:0%
Now The Spill
um

02:26:28.429 --> 02:26:28.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:31.670 --> 02:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
has come back we um
 
02:26:34.130 --> 02:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
it was heard
 
02:26:37.730 --> 02:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
last session and um
 
02:26:41.630 --> 02:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
as formerly SB 216
 
02:26:44.450 --> 02:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
and it was voted voted ought to pass on
 
02:26:47.210 --> 02:26:47.220 align:start position:0%
a senate floor on a Voice vote
 
02:26:49.190 --> 02:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
and house Judiciary Committee it was
 
02:26:52.969 --> 02:26:52.979 align:start position:0%
voted itl 11 to 9 on the house floor the
 
02:26:56.330 --> 02:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
the vote was itl on a Voice vote
 
02:26:58.190 --> 02:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
now this bill would create a commission
 
02:27:00.469 --> 02:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
to study the landlord and tenant
 
02:27:02.990 --> 02:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
mediation pilot program that has been
 
02:27:05.570 --> 02:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
ongoing in the circuit courts the
 
02:27:07.190 --> 02:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
program was developed by the circuit
 
02:27:08.929 --> 02:27:08.939 align:start position:0%
courts to help landlords and tenants
 
02:27:11.929 --> 02:27:11.939 align:start position:0%
work through issues to avoid an eviction
 
02:27:14.690 --> 02:27:14.700 align:start position:0%
mediation is not mandatory in both the
 
02:27:17.389 --> 02:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
landlord and tenant must agree to
 
02:27:20.270 --> 02:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
mediation the pilot program has been a
 
02:27:23.090 --> 02:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
great success and has kept 80 percent of
 
02:27:26.030 --> 02:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
tenants facing eviction in their homes
 
02:27:27.950 --> 02:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
the study commission would provide the
 
02:27:29.929 --> 02:27:29.939 align:start position:0%
general court in all relevant
 
02:27:32.210 --> 02:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
stakeholders with an appropriate venue
 
02:27:34.910 --> 02:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
to analyze a program
 
02:27:37.969 --> 02:27:37.979 align:start position:0%
assess what has and has not worked in
 
02:27:40.730 --> 02:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
recommend changes going forward the
 
02:27:42.590 --> 02:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
mediation approach is conciliatory
 
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
rather than punitive and could lead to
 
02:27:47.150 --> 02:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
preservation of tenancy and prevent
 
02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:49.790 align:start position:0%
preservation of tenancy and prevent
homelessness

02:27:49.790 --> 02:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
02:27:52.190 --> 02:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
in short the landlord tenant mediation
 
02:27:54.590 --> 02:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
program was a temporary Circuit Court
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
pilot program in conjunction with the
 
02:28:00.830 --> 02:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
office of mediation and arbitration and
 
02:28:03.889 --> 02:28:03.899 align:start position:0%
implemented as an emergency
 
02:28:06.530 --> 02:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
Leyland tenant mediation pilot pro
 
02:28:09.170 --> 02:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
project in Concord in the Claremont
 
02:28:10.670 --> 02:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
district courts
 
02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
mediation cases in which the tenant
 
02:28:14.570 --> 02:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
files and appearance were referred to
 
02:28:17.710 --> 02:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
mediation on or before the trial date
 
02:28:20.450 --> 02:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
the pilot program was very successful
 
02:28:22.910 --> 02:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
and benefited landlords and tenants
 
02:28:25.250 --> 02:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
02:28:28.550 --> 02:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
of 36 cases that reached mediation 79
 
02:28:30.230 --> 02:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
percent were settled
 
02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
under mediation for non-payment of rent
 
02:28:35.270 --> 02:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
cases the parties work out a payment
 
02:28:37.910 --> 02:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
agreement to pay the current monthly
 
02:28:40.610 --> 02:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
rent in to pay their average over a
 
02:28:42.650 --> 02:28:42.660 align:start position:0%
limited time period
 
02:28:45.050 --> 02:28:45.060 align:start position:0%
tenants eligible for emergency rental
 
02:28:46.670 --> 02:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
assistance are referred to social
 
02:28:49.910 --> 02:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
service agencies in agency payments are
 
02:28:52.309 --> 02:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
paid directly to the landlord
 
02:28:54.530 --> 02:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
do the success of the pilot program I
 
02:28:56.389 --> 02:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
would like to see it placed into statute
 
02:28:59.270 --> 02:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
and establish a
 
02:29:01.190 --> 02:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
02:29:03.530 --> 02:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
study commission will help with shape
 
02:29:08.270 --> 02:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:10.429 --> 02:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
the vote for this bill is for a study
 
02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
committee only
 
02:29:15.230 --> 02:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
it does not change any statutes at this
 
02:29:15.240 --> 02:29:16.010 align:start position:0%
it does not change any statutes at this
point

02:29:16.010 --> 02:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:29:18.490 --> 02:29:18.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm open for questions
 
02:29:22.010 --> 02:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh questions uh for representative di
 
02:29:24.770 --> 02:29:24.780 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo uh representative Wallace thank
 
02:29:26.330 --> 02:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thanks for taking my
 
02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
question this uh pilot program was this
 
02:29:34.070 --> 02:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:37.309 --> 02:29:37.319 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you other questions for
 
02:29:38.690 --> 02:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
this witness representative Alexander
 
02:29:39.950 --> 02:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you my friend
 
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:29:44.389 --> 02:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
um so it seems to me like this program
 
02:29:48.050 --> 02:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
like with the pilot program works I mean
 
02:29:50.809 --> 02:29:50.819 align:start position:0%
if you're looking 80 like settle
 
02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
why aren't you putting in a bill just to
 
02:29:54.650 --> 02:29:54.660 align:start position:0%
fund it why are we studying it again
 
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
number one and why is it a commission
 
02:29:59.929 --> 02:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
instead of a study committee I
 
02:30:01.429 --> 02:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
understand that commissions typically
 
02:30:03.770 --> 02:30:03.780 align:start position:0%
cost more money and like why aren't we
 
02:30:04.910 --> 02:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
just funding it
 
02:30:07.370 --> 02:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
well I just uh use the term commission
 
02:30:09.590 --> 02:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
and committee interchangeably and I may
 
02:30:11.809 --> 02:30:11.819 align:start position:0%
be in error on that
 
02:30:11.819 --> 02:30:12.590 align:start position:0%
be in error on that
um

02:30:12.590 --> 02:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:15.050 --> 02:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
we wanted the study committee we wanted
 
02:30:17.330 --> 02:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
to evaluate you know
 
02:30:20.690 --> 02:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
um what the successes were and what the
 
02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
failures were
 
02:30:26.150 --> 02:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
so I've actually worked on the initial
 
02:30:29.990 --> 02:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
bill with uh Senator Perkins qualca so
 
02:30:33.290 --> 02:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
this was initially her bill and it was
 
02:30:35.210 --> 02:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
she and I together that decided we
 
02:30:37.790 --> 02:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
wanted a study Commission
 
02:30:40.130 --> 02:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
follow-up do you mind no but please go
 
02:30:42.469 --> 02:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
ahead would you be opposed of just doing
 
02:30:44.330 --> 02:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
a legislative study committee on that
 
02:30:45.830 --> 02:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
instead of a commission I understand it
 
02:30:47.690 --> 02:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
costs more absolutely and I know that
 
02:30:50.210 --> 02:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
we're having a committee on commissions
 
02:30:52.010 --> 02:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
and about how there's a lot of
 
02:30:53.870 --> 02:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessary commissions that the general
 
02:30:56.090 --> 02:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
Corps passes so would this be something
 
02:30:58.010 --> 02:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
where you know you and I and maybe a
 
02:30:59.330 --> 02:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
couple people could sit down this summer
 
02:31:01.429 --> 02:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
and talk about in the housing area and
 
02:31:02.630 --> 02:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
maybe come up with solution that way
 
02:31:04.429 --> 02:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
well I wanted
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
um some stakeholders to weigh in
 
02:31:10.790 --> 02:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
because it does involve landlords and
 
02:31:13.250 --> 02:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
property owners and we want to get their
 
02:31:16.010 --> 02:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
their take it involves um
 
02:31:18.290 --> 02:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
Legal Services Community we'd like to
 
02:31:21.110 --> 02:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
get their take so we want it to be sort
 
02:31:23.690 --> 02:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
of like an inclusive process thank you
 
02:31:25.429 --> 02:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
yeah and I completely agree I think we
 
02:31:27.710 --> 02:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
have landlords stakeholders we have the
 
02:31:30.110 --> 02:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
court system in the back
 
02:31:32.270 --> 02:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
would you be opposed to changing it just
 
02:31:35.590 --> 02:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:38.690 --> 02:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
uh could you I don't understand you a
 
02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:44.150 --> 02:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know I need to think about that
 
02:31:46.550 --> 02:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Smith if you
 
02:31:48.650 --> 02:31:48.660 align:start position:0%
have a question I just if I could just
 
02:31:50.990 --> 02:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative Alexander's
 
02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:52.969 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative Alexander's
suggestion

02:31:52.969 --> 02:31:52.979 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
um uh if in fact there was language that
 
02:31:56.160 --> 02:31:57.950 align:start position:0%
um uh if in fact there was language that
indicated

02:31:57.950 --> 02:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
02:32:01.570 --> 02:32:01.580 align:start position:0%
um that the intention was to include
 
02:32:05.570 --> 02:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh stakeholders in the process of
 
02:32:07.969 --> 02:32:07.979 align:start position:0%
evaluation and deciding where to go from
 
02:32:10.910 --> 02:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
here would you then feel
 
02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
um that you would be able to support
 
02:32:13.439 --> 02:32:14.330 align:start position:0%
um that you would be able to support
that

02:32:14.330 --> 02:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:32:18.170 --> 02:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
yes thank you absolutely other questions
 
02:32:19.790 --> 02:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
for this Witness
 
02:32:23.210 --> 02:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez thank you
 
02:32:26.510 --> 02:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
how were people referred to the study
 
02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh the mediation program how were they
 
02:32:30.830 --> 02:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
referred to the mediation program do you
 
02:32:30.840 --> 02:32:33.290 align:start position:0%
referred to the mediation program do you
know

02:32:33.290 --> 02:32:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:35.270 --> 02:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
oh how would they get referrals right
 
02:32:38.690 --> 02:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
how did this this these 30 some odd
 
02:32:41.270 --> 02:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
people 36 cases how did they get into
 
02:32:42.889 --> 02:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
this through the circuit courts through
 
02:32:44.929 --> 02:32:44.939 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court yes so if it was
 
02:32:47.210 --> 02:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
expanded to
 
02:32:50.090 --> 02:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
more circuit courts you'd see a lot more
 
02:32:52.250 --> 02:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
people come in sure it would be part of
 
02:32:56.210 --> 02:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
like a um landlord tenant intake during
 
02:32:59.690 --> 02:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
the court process and
 
02:33:01.670 --> 02:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:33:04.070 --> 02:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
the court would offer mediation for the
 
02:33:08.150 --> 02:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
landlord and the tenant at no cost and
 
02:33:10.790 --> 02:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
there are services available for
 
02:33:13.130 --> 02:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
attendance like if um
 
02:33:15.110 --> 02:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
let's say it's a non-payment or rent
 
02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
issue and perhaps it's a child's they're
 
02:33:20.809 --> 02:33:20.819 align:start position:0%
not receiving child support then the
 
02:33:24.889 --> 02:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
mediate made it mediator could refer the
 
02:33:28.130 --> 02:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
tenant to services to
 
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
get that Charlotte support money so they
 
02:33:32.150 --> 02:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
can pay the rent thank you all right
 
02:33:33.650 --> 02:33:33.660 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
02:33:33.660 --> 02:33:34.969 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
Macbeth

02:33:34.969 --> 02:33:34.979 align:start position:0%
Macbeth
 
02:33:37.010 --> 02:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:33:38.270 --> 02:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my question
 
02:33:40.610 --> 02:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
we have to look around that speaker
 
02:33:43.010 --> 02:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
um so my question the expansion I'm
 
02:33:45.950 --> 02:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
curious if um your intentions of
 
02:33:47.750 --> 02:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
expanding it across the state and maybe
 
02:33:49.670 --> 02:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
put a priority in for Rockingham County
 
02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
I had heard I was on a CLE last week and
 
02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
I heard how great this program is
 
02:33:57.290 --> 02:33:57.300 align:start position:0%
landlords and tenants and as far as
 
02:33:59.210 --> 02:33:59.220 align:start position:0%
referring it usually happens that day of
 
02:34:01.250 --> 02:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
the hearing um where the people come to
 
02:34:03.650 --> 02:34:03.660 align:start position:0%
court and they're resolving issues right
 
02:34:07.670 --> 02:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
in the lobby so um so is the expansion
 
02:34:09.110 --> 02:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
you're thinking going to be Statewide
 
02:34:10.910 --> 02:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
and is there a priority for Rockingham
 
02:34:13.490 --> 02:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
County I would think for all of the um
 
02:34:16.730 --> 02:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
02:34:22.070 --> 02:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan
 
02:34:22.080 --> 02:34:22.969 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan
um

02:34:22.969 --> 02:34:22.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:24.530 --> 02:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll make this quick because
 
02:34:26.210 --> 02:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a would you believe but
 
02:34:27.889 --> 02:34:27.899 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I'm also a
 
02:34:29.870 --> 02:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the bill and then I think
 
02:34:32.809 --> 02:34:32.819 align:start position:0%
the inclusion of the court system and
 
02:34:33.889 --> 02:34:33.899 align:start position:0%
these other and these outside
 
02:34:33.899 --> 02:34:35.990 align:start position:0%
these other and these outside
stakeholders

02:34:35.990 --> 02:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
02:34:38.270 --> 02:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
um improves the bill and also that this
 
02:34:39.889 --> 02:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
commission is in fact extremely
 
02:34:42.590 --> 02:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
necessary it's not it's not a commission
 
02:34:44.630 --> 02:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's dealing it's not it's not an
 
02:34:46.190 --> 02:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
outmoded commission that hasn't done
 
02:34:48.230 --> 02:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
anything in years but this is a new
 
02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
commission and it's a very timely topic
 
02:34:55.490 --> 02:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
uh yes I believe it all right are there
 
02:34:57.349 --> 02:34:57.359 align:start position:0%

02:36:38.110 --> 02:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
little couple more pieces of information
 
02:36:42.190 --> 02:36:42.200 align:start position:0%
that are recent that may also influence
 
02:36:46.429 --> 02:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
your decision on on this bill one is
 
02:36:48.830 --> 02:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
um so this bill is set up there two
 
02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
phases to the landlord tenant mediation
 
02:36:54.190 --> 02:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
one is a pre-filing process in which
 
02:36:57.650 --> 02:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
the parties are notified of a pre-filing
 
02:37:00.370 --> 02:37:00.380 align:start position:0%
eviction a mediation process
 
02:37:03.110 --> 02:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
through various forms that have been
 
02:37:05.030 --> 02:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
created that identify specifically this
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
process we've reached out or I'm sorry
 
02:37:10.910 --> 02:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
in in the course of that process in 2020
 
02:37:14.210 --> 02:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
uh end of 2021 through calendar year
 
02:37:14.220 --> 02:37:15.969 align:start position:0%
uh end of 2021 through calendar year
2022

02:37:15.969 --> 02:37:15.979 align:start position:0%
2022
 
02:37:20.150 --> 02:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
729 parties contacted the courts of
 
02:37:23.330 --> 02:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
those 199 went into mediation pre-suit
 
02:37:25.910 --> 02:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
we don't yet have data on the successor
 
02:37:28.910 --> 02:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
failure of that 199. there's the second
 
02:37:32.510 --> 02:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
part of it is uh is in Concord and I'm
 
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
sorry in in Nashua in Manchester that's
 
02:37:38.929 --> 02:37:38.939 align:start position:0%
a post-filing mediation program in that
 
02:37:42.230 --> 02:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
program there have been 120 mediations
 
02:37:45.530 --> 02:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
um in those two courts 75 percent of
 
02:37:47.330 --> 02:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
those have settled so that's more
 
02:37:49.010 --> 02:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
updated that's calendar year through
 
02:37:51.770 --> 02:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
calendar year 2022.
 
02:37:51.780 --> 02:37:52.429 align:start position:0%
calendar year 2022.
um

02:37:52.429 --> 02:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:56.090 --> 02:37:56.100 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of this is that we have
 
02:37:59.809 --> 02:37:59.819 align:start position:0%
uh retained uh resolution systems
 
02:38:02.690 --> 02:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
Institute to do an evaluation of this
 
02:38:04.910 --> 02:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
program so they are undertaking a
 
02:38:06.770 --> 02:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
process evaluation of the entire program
 
02:38:09.590 --> 02:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
at this point and that's new
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
um that is we're expecting a report for
 
02:38:14.809 --> 02:38:14.819 align:start position:0%
that not until October of 2023 end of
 
02:38:17.150 --> 02:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
October beginning in November
 
02:38:20.090 --> 02:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
um so that would not inform a committee
 
02:38:22.190 --> 02:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
if it was established it may be just
 
02:38:25.070 --> 02:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
this may be a year too early because
 
02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
this may provide important information
 
02:38:28.610 --> 02:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
we would of course be happy to share
 
02:38:31.910 --> 02:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
that with the legislature as to what the
 
02:38:33.710 --> 02:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
findings are of that but we are
 
02:38:35.690 --> 02:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
undertaking sort of a detailed process
 
02:38:38.809 --> 02:38:38.819 align:start position:0%
evaluation of our program it's a program
 
02:38:40.370 --> 02:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
we're very proud of we wanted to
 
02:38:43.309 --> 02:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
continue the other aspect that is also
 
02:38:45.410 --> 02:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
very recent is we have received
 
02:38:47.870 --> 02:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
additional Federal grant funds to
 
02:38:49.969 --> 02:38:49.979 align:start position:0%
continue this we anticipate that would
 
02:38:52.130 --> 02:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
continue the program for another two
 
02:38:52.140 --> 02:38:52.969 align:start position:0%
continue the program for another two
years

02:38:52.969 --> 02:38:52.979 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:38:56.809 --> 02:38:56.819 align:start position:0%
so our existing uh coveted related money
 
02:38:59.570 --> 02:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
would expire mid mid year this year and
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
then I think we have another two years
 
02:39:03.110 --> 02:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
of funding now available through this
 
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
new grant that we have obtained and with
 
02:39:07.849 --> 02:39:07.859 align:start position:0%
that I'll conclude my comments but would
 
02:39:08.929 --> 02:39:08.939 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions
 
02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
02:39:17.270 --> 02:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:20.150 --> 02:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
oh I guess I'm just trying to figure out
 
02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
why with all the activity
 
02:39:24.590 --> 02:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
we just don't have a program
 
02:39:28.250 --> 02:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
why are we continuing to study it when
 
02:39:30.889 --> 02:39:30.899 align:start position:0%
it appears that there is a mechanism
 
02:39:30.899 --> 02:39:32.090 align:start position:0%
it appears that there is a mechanism
it's

02:39:32.090 --> 02:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:39:34.670 --> 02:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
reasonably successful
 
02:39:37.610 --> 02:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
yet we're trying to keep to study this
 
02:39:40.730 --> 02:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
now is that coming out of your office or
 
02:39:43.010 --> 02:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
or what
 
02:39:44.990 --> 02:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question no I
 
02:39:47.690 --> 02:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
mean our office is implementing the
 
02:39:49.429 --> 02:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
existing program we have a Statewide
 
02:39:53.929 --> 02:39:53.939 align:start position:0%
pre-suit and we have the two courts that
 
02:39:55.670 --> 02:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
are that are doing the post Suite
 
02:39:58.309 --> 02:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
mediation program we've implemented that
 
02:40:00.770 --> 02:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to continue it we are
 
02:40:02.990 --> 02:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
evaluating it to make sure that we're
 
02:40:05.270 --> 02:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
doing it well that we don't need to make
 
02:40:09.309 --> 02:40:09.319 align:start position:0%
process changes in in our in our program
 
02:40:13.309 --> 02:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
so the the the further study of it is is
 
02:40:16.490 --> 02:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
being done internally to make sure that
 
02:40:19.010 --> 02:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
we're doing it properly and that that we
 
02:40:21.110 --> 02:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
have we couldn't you know that that
 
02:40:22.670 --> 02:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
either more improvements to be made
 
02:40:24.950 --> 02:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to learn about that in in
 
02:40:26.750 --> 02:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
this process whether or not the
 
02:40:29.030 --> 02:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to have its own study
 
02:40:32.030 --> 02:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
we you know we're obviously proud of it
 
02:40:33.830 --> 02:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
we're happy to talk about it but it's
 
02:40:35.570 --> 02:40:35.580 align:start position:0%
not original donating from us
 
02:40:35.580 --> 02:40:37.130 align:start position:0%
not original donating from us
necessarily

02:40:37.130 --> 02:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
02:40:39.530 --> 02:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
yes representative divine
 
02:40:41.090 --> 02:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
02:40:43.670 --> 02:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question when it
 
02:40:46.309 --> 02:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
comes to the Federal grant funds that
 
02:40:49.130 --> 02:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
are supporting this commission
 
02:40:49.140 --> 02:40:50.030 align:start position:0%
are supporting this commission
um

02:40:50.030 --> 02:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:52.010 --> 02:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
how is that being spent and how is that
 
02:40:54.050 --> 02:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
being utilized and you did say it was
 
02:40:57.910 --> 02:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
being you um you had funds up until 2024
 
02:41:02.990 --> 02:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
is that keeping this going just to
 
02:41:05.570 --> 02:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
utilize those funds or should we be
 
02:41:08.270 --> 02:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
making you know passing this and saying
 
02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay we have we have a good set
 
02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:12.710 align:start position:0%
okay we have we have a good set
um

02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:15.889 align:start position:0%
um
uh

02:41:15.889 --> 02:41:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:19.370 --> 02:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
a very good Set uh implementation of
 
02:41:21.469 --> 02:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
mediation if you already have it in
 
02:41:24.590 --> 02:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
place so so uh we think we have funding
 
02:41:26.510 --> 02:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
through 2025
 
02:41:29.210 --> 02:41:29.220 align:start position:0%
um and the so we would get through the
 
02:41:30.889 --> 02:41:30.899 align:start position:0%
current year or mid-year this year with
 
02:41:32.630 --> 02:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
the existing funding and the new Grant
 
02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
would go another two years
 
02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:35.750 align:start position:0%
would go another two years
um

02:41:35.750 --> 02:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:38.990 --> 02:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of of
 
02:41:41.450 --> 02:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
I guess maybe I don't understand fully
 
02:41:42.830 --> 02:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:45.730 align:start position:0%
the the
foreign

02:41:45.730 --> 02:41:45.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:48.349 --> 02:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering how this the the
 
02:41:51.410 --> 02:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
federal money is being used to keep it
 
02:41:55.130 --> 02:41:55.140 align:start position:0%
going so um the federal monies in in the
 
02:41:57.290 --> 02:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
current upper monies are being used uh
 
02:41:59.809 --> 02:41:59.819 align:start position:0%
in two ways one is we fully fund the
 
02:42:02.630 --> 02:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
mediators themselves so the the cost of
 
02:42:04.490 --> 02:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
the mediators is being funded through
 
02:42:07.309 --> 02:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
the program and then we also have
 
02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
um a court staff who uh coordinates the
 
02:42:12.230 --> 02:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
mediations and and scheduling and making
 
02:42:14.330 --> 02:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
sure parties are aware of it and also
 
02:42:17.510 --> 02:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
doing Outreach and uh and making sure
 
02:42:19.610 --> 02:42:19.620 align:start position:0%
the availability of this mediation
 
02:42:23.570 --> 02:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
program is uh is known
 
02:42:25.490 --> 02:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this one
 
02:42:27.590 --> 02:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
02:42:28.910 --> 02:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Mr head for taking
 
02:42:29.929 --> 02:42:29.939 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:42:31.849 --> 02:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
um so it seems to me so you're funded
 
02:42:33.830 --> 02:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
through 2025
 
02:42:36.290 --> 02:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
um through Federal grant funding um and
 
02:42:38.270 --> 02:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
you're already studying it through the
 
02:42:39.650 --> 02:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
judicial branch it's already doing their
 
02:42:41.510 --> 02:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
internal investigation on that
 
02:42:43.490 --> 02:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
um based on your current
 
02:42:43.500 --> 02:42:44.630 align:start position:0%
um based on your current
um

02:42:44.630 --> 02:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:46.130 --> 02:42:46.140 align:start position:0%
the way you see this program already
 
02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
would you come back maybe in 2025
 
02:42:50.990 --> 02:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
request to fully fund this program based
 
02:42:53.630 --> 02:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
on its success initially so that's a at
 
02:42:55.190 --> 02:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
least a possibility
 
02:42:56.809 --> 02:42:56.819 align:start position:0%
um it would depend on whether or not
 
02:42:58.309 --> 02:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
additional funding is available through
 
02:43:00.830 --> 02:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
grants through federal grants um so we
 
02:43:02.570 --> 02:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
would probably continue to apply for
 
02:43:04.490 --> 02:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
federal grants but
 
02:43:06.889 --> 02:43:06.899 align:start position:0%
um it may also become a future budget
 
02:43:06.899 --> 02:43:08.450 align:start position:0%
um it may also become a future budget
request

02:43:08.450 --> 02:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:43:10.730 --> 02:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
representative Manos
 
02:43:12.349 --> 02:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
02:43:19.730 --> 02:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:24.410 --> 02:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
action to enforce the party's agreement
 
02:43:26.690 --> 02:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
uh so thank you for the question any
 
02:43:28.730 --> 02:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
sort of agreement
 
02:43:31.309 --> 02:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
um is itself sort of a contract so those
 
02:43:34.670 --> 02:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
by by their nature settlement Agreements
 
02:43:39.349 --> 02:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
are executed and and ultimately become
 
02:43:41.090 --> 02:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
an enforceable agreement between the
 
02:43:41.100 --> 02:43:44.090 align:start position:0%
an enforceable agreement between the
parties

02:43:44.090 --> 02:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:46.969 --> 02:43:46.979 align:start position:0%
but does the court schedule a follow-up
 
02:43:49.130 --> 02:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
how does the court does the court retain
 
02:43:52.250 --> 02:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and or is it necessary for
 
02:43:54.650 --> 02:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
the landlord to come back for example or
 
02:43:56.929 --> 02:43:56.939 align:start position:0%
the tenant if the agreement isn't
 
02:43:59.090 --> 02:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
followed um so thank you so you know the
 
02:44:01.670 --> 02:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
the mediation would conclude that open
 
02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:03.110 align:start position:0%
the mediation would conclude that open
case

02:44:03.110 --> 02:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:44:04.969 --> 02:44:04.979 align:start position:0%
um and that that would be the settlement
 
02:44:06.950 --> 02:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
would be the end of that case and if
 
02:44:08.510 --> 02:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
there's any further proceedings a new
 
02:44:10.670 --> 02:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
case would get filed
 
02:44:12.170 --> 02:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
other questions for this week yes
 
02:44:13.490 --> 02:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
representative tur
 
02:44:16.370 --> 02:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
yeah uh thanks and and thanks for uh
 
02:44:18.349 --> 02:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
providing the Insight from from within
 
02:44:19.790 --> 02:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
your uh Branch
 
02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:20.570 align:start position:0%
your uh Branch
um

02:44:20.570 --> 02:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:22.790 --> 02:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm wondering is in what in
 
02:44:25.190 --> 02:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
what you've said recently would you
 
02:44:28.730 --> 02:44:28.740 align:start position:0%
clarify whether or not you think this is
 
02:44:31.070 --> 02:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh in some way redundant to the work
 
02:44:34.429 --> 02:44:34.439 align:start position:0%
that you're doing internally or ready to
 
02:44:36.170 --> 02:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
um study and evaluate the program this
 
02:44:38.450 --> 02:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
looks like it brings together a variety
 
02:44:41.510 --> 02:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
of of different stakeholders and parties
 
02:44:45.410 --> 02:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
and I understand the the the interest in
 
02:44:46.790 --> 02:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
sort of understanding what parts of the
 
02:44:48.170 --> 02:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
program are working well and what parts
 
02:44:51.610 --> 02:44:51.620 align:start position:0%
maybe aren't is is is is is this
 
02:44:54.290 --> 02:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
duplicative or interfering or do you
 
02:44:56.809 --> 02:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
feel it adds to what you're working on
 
02:44:58.309 --> 02:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question I I
 
02:44:59.570 --> 02:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
would not
 
02:45:01.790 --> 02:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
um just it wouldn't necessarily be
 
02:45:04.429 --> 02:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
duplicative the the evaluation we're
 
02:45:08.210 --> 02:45:08.220 align:start position:0%
doing now is uh entirely internal
 
02:45:10.190 --> 02:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
um just in terms of of How It's Working
 
02:45:12.349 --> 02:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
internally to the extent a committee or
 
02:45:14.450 --> 02:45:14.460 align:start position:0%
commission reformed that had additional
 
02:45:16.370 --> 02:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
parties brought in
 
02:45:18.110 --> 02:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
um that would be a different process
 
02:45:21.050 --> 02:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
than what we're currently undertaking
 
02:45:23.809 --> 02:45:23.819 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness I guess
 
02:45:26.630 --> 02:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
I just had one uh representative Mr head
 
02:45:29.270 --> 02:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
is the um am I understanding correctly
 
02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
that both the priesthood and the post
 
02:45:32.640 --> 02:45:33.670 align:start position:0%
that both the priesthood and the post
suit

02:45:33.670 --> 02:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
suit
 
02:45:36.230 --> 02:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
mediation are those are entirely
 
02:45:37.969 --> 02:45:37.979 align:start position:0%
voluntary in other words both sides have
 
02:45:40.070 --> 02:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
to agree absolutely absolutely it's
 
02:45:43.130 --> 02:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
entirely voluntary or so I guess I I
 
02:45:44.990 --> 02:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
have to sort of follow up on I think on
 
02:45:47.090 --> 02:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
rep representative Alexander's question
 
02:45:50.690 --> 02:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
and and I I completely understand and
 
02:45:53.030 --> 02:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
applaud representative De Lorenzo for
 
02:45:55.550 --> 02:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
for the sort of go slow be careful
 
02:45:57.170 --> 02:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
approach I think that's that's entirely
 
02:46:00.110 --> 02:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate but I'm wondering if
 
02:46:02.750 --> 02:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
if this is completely voluntary
 
02:46:05.330 --> 02:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
and if nobody and I don't you know I
 
02:46:08.210 --> 02:46:08.220 align:start position:0%
haven't seen anybody hear from the
 
02:46:10.429 --> 02:46:10.439 align:start position:0%
landlord Community for example or the
 
02:46:12.650 --> 02:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
tenant Community coming saying that this
 
02:46:16.910 --> 02:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
is a bad idea I'm sort of wondering
 
02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
putting the funding issue aside for the
 
02:46:22.910 --> 02:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
moment I'm sort of wondering why we need
 
02:46:25.730 --> 02:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
any study whether it's legislative or
 
02:46:27.770 --> 02:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
broader why don't we just
 
02:46:30.230 --> 02:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
yeah why don't we just say let's expand
 
02:46:32.990 --> 02:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
this program I'm uh again subject to
 
02:46:35.870 --> 02:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
funding United Finance you know is is
 
02:46:38.450 --> 02:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
cursing Down on Me Maybe but but why not
 
02:46:40.610 --> 02:46:40.620 align:start position:0%
I mean in terms of the policy issue it
 
02:46:43.130 --> 02:46:43.140 align:start position:0%
sounds like to me every nobody seems to
 
02:46:44.990 --> 02:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
sees a problem why don't we just do it
 
02:46:47.510 --> 02:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
and so thank you for the question one is
 
02:46:49.910 --> 02:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
um I agree the feedback we get is
 
02:46:52.070 --> 02:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
positive from both sides so landlords
 
02:46:54.530 --> 02:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
and tenants have provided positive
 
02:46:56.330 --> 02:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
feedback on the process it's a way of
 
02:46:58.849 --> 02:46:58.859 align:start position:0%
resolving disputes
 
02:47:01.790 --> 02:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
um as to making a permanent or or
 
02:47:04.130 --> 02:47:04.140 align:start position:0%
expanding it we are interested in doing
 
02:47:06.230 --> 02:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
that we want to do it efficiently so
 
02:47:07.610 --> 02:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
let's we'll look at what we're doing we
 
02:47:11.150 --> 02:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
started this to make sure on a on on a
 
02:47:14.050 --> 02:47:14.060 align:start position:0%
well we've expanded the pre to Statewide
 
02:47:17.270 --> 02:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
and then the post is is primarily in
 
02:47:20.809 --> 02:47:20.819 align:start position:0%
those two courts and the goal ultimately
 
02:47:23.270 --> 02:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
is to expand it let's make sure through
 
02:47:25.190 --> 02:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
this internal evaluation we're doing it
 
02:47:27.349 --> 02:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
right and then and then look to to
 
02:47:29.570 --> 02:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
expand it to the other courts I may have
 
02:47:31.550 --> 02:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
gotten a text that tells me one thing
 
02:47:34.969 --> 02:47:34.979 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for that I did not never
 
02:47:34.979 --> 02:47:36.770 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for that I did not never
mind

02:47:36.770 --> 02:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
mind
 
02:47:39.170 --> 02:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
right right that's a good point that's a
 
02:47:41.690 --> 02:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
good point okay yeah
 
02:47:44.929 --> 02:47:44.939 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes you were you I'm done
 
02:47:46.370 --> 02:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
you're done okay all right other
 
02:47:48.410 --> 02:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness yes
 
02:47:50.150 --> 02:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative greeson thank you Mr
 
02:47:51.349 --> 02:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you sir for answering
 
02:47:54.590 --> 02:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
our questions uh the
 
02:47:56.990 --> 02:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
the current program for the two years
 
02:47:59.590 --> 02:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
was 733
 
02:48:04.130 --> 02:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
490.58 what is the new funding that I
 
02:48:06.170 --> 02:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
mean according to
 
02:48:07.910 --> 02:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm assuming that's the appropriate
 
02:48:10.309 --> 02:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know information I don't know
 
02:48:11.389 --> 02:48:11.399 align:start position:0%
the answer to actually how much the
 
02:48:13.790 --> 02:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
current whatever that was how much is
 
02:48:16.849 --> 02:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
the current funding for the next two
 
02:48:20.570 --> 02:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
years and does that seem like a
 
02:48:23.630 --> 02:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount going forward so that
 
02:48:26.330 --> 02:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
uh if we were to expand it
 
02:48:28.969 --> 02:48:28.979 align:start position:0%
permanently uh we wouldn't get the
 
02:48:30.889 --> 02:48:30.899 align:start position:0%
ticking Time Bomb of it costing 10 times
 
02:48:32.210 --> 02:48:32.220 align:start position:0%
as much
 
02:48:33.710 --> 02:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question the the
 
02:48:36.830 --> 02:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
next Grant is roughly and and to hold me
 
02:48:38.270 --> 02:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
specifically to this number somewhere in
 
02:48:41.410 --> 02:48:41.420 align:start position:0%
the 500 to 600 000 range I think
 
02:48:41.420 --> 02:48:42.050 align:start position:0%
the 500 to 600 000 range I think
[Music]

02:48:42.050 --> 02:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:48:42.060 --> 02:48:43.370 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:48:43.370 --> 02:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
whether you know and and that includes
 
02:48:47.750 --> 02:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide in the pre
 
02:48:49.490 --> 02:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
um and more restricted in the in the
 
02:48:50.990 --> 02:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
post filing
 
02:48:53.150 --> 02:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
um sort of what the cost is Statewide I
 
02:48:55.250 --> 02:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
don't have an answer to that but it is
 
02:48:57.710 --> 02:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
something that given the experience we
 
02:49:00.590 --> 02:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
have I think we would have the ability
 
02:49:02.990 --> 02:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
to to provide a pretty
 
02:49:06.410 --> 02:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
uh accurate estimate of of the cost to
 
02:49:08.690 --> 02:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
go Statewide if we if we go there and
 
02:49:10.130 --> 02:49:10.140 align:start position:0%
again if there are additional Grant
 
02:49:11.990 --> 02:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
funds available we would seek those out
 
02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:12.950 align:start position:0%
funds available we would seek those out
also

02:49:12.950 --> 02:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
right other questions for this Witness
 
02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:17.520 align:start position:0%

02:49:58.910 --> 02:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
one of those gems
 
02:50:00.830 --> 02:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
um one of the Silver Linings and so we
 
02:50:03.349 --> 02:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
too have heard really good feedback on
 
02:50:07.070 --> 02:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
the program if you if you uh feel the
 
02:50:08.630 --> 02:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
legislature should have a commission
 
02:50:10.730 --> 02:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
that brings in interested parties or
 
02:50:12.650 --> 02:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
committee that invites interested
 
02:50:14.929 --> 02:50:14.939 align:start position:0%
parties to testify it's also really good
 
02:50:16.730 --> 02:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
to learn that there's a formal
 
02:50:19.190 --> 02:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
evaluation if you feel that the
 
02:50:21.830 --> 02:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
legislature has a role in formalizing
 
02:50:24.950 --> 02:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
that review to establish some education
 
02:50:28.070 --> 02:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
but for hopefully you know budgetary
 
02:50:31.550 --> 02:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
item is proposed next budget cycle to
 
02:50:34.190 --> 02:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
support sustaining such a successful
 
02:50:37.670 --> 02:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
program I would say we're flexible and
 
02:50:40.130 --> 02:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
appreciate your consideration
 
02:50:42.469 --> 02:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
02:50:45.110 --> 02:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much ma'am is
 
02:50:47.690 --> 02:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who wishes to testify
 
02:50:51.530 --> 02:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 235
 
02:50:53.510 --> 02:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
I've seen none I'm going to close the
 
02:50:56.450 --> 02:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 235
 
02:50:56.460 --> 02:50:58.309 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 235
um

02:50:58.309 --> 02:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:00.650 --> 02:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
all right I'm gonna turn then and we're
 
02:51:02.990 --> 02:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
I know we're behind I'm gonna turn to
 
02:51:06.050 --> 02:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
house bill 261.
 
02:51:06.060 --> 02:51:07.969 align:start position:0%
house bill 261.
um

02:51:07.969 --> 02:51:07.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:10.070 --> 02:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
and hang on one second
 
02:51:15.349 --> 02:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:17.750 --> 02:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh authorizing residential tenants to
 
02:51:20.030 --> 02:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
terminate their lease uh in instances of
 
02:51:21.530 --> 02:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
domestic violence or following a
 
02:51:24.230 --> 02:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
disability uh a disabling illness or
 
02:51:26.630 --> 02:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
accident and I will turn to uh
 
02:51:29.570 --> 02:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
representative Reed for uh the prime
 
02:51:31.790 --> 02:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the Bill thank you again Mr
 
02:51:35.450 --> 02:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
chair and honorable members uh 50
 
02:51:37.910 --> 02:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
through after this with me
 
02:51:40.670 --> 02:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
so um this is pretty straightforward
 
02:51:43.790 --> 02:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
it's allowing victims of domestic
 
02:51:45.830 --> 02:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
violence as well as stalking
 
02:51:50.389 --> 02:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
to be able to leave situations that are
 
02:51:53.690 --> 02:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
a danger to them by releasing them from
 
02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
their lease obligations it also is
 
02:51:58.910 --> 02:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
saying that if a tenant develops a new
 
02:52:01.910 --> 02:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
disability that makes the enjoyment of
 
02:52:04.849 --> 02:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
the property impossible so for example
 
02:52:07.550 --> 02:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
if someone's living in a third floor
 
02:52:10.370 --> 02:52:10.380 align:start position:0%
walk up and then loses their legs in a
 
02:52:12.769 --> 02:52:12.779 align:start position:0%
tragic accident that they would also be
 
02:52:14.330 --> 02:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
able to leave their lease without
 
02:52:14.340 --> 02:52:15.670 align:start position:0%
able to leave their lease without
penalty

02:52:15.670 --> 02:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
02:52:18.050 --> 02:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
so there are real world examples for
 
02:52:20.809 --> 02:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
both of these both are
 
02:52:23.750 --> 02:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
well it's modeled I originally put it in
 
02:52:25.429 --> 02:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
modeled after a Tennessee law that
 
02:52:28.610 --> 02:52:28.620 align:start position:0%
passed I'm originally from Tennessee and
 
02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'm friends with a couple Tennessee
 
02:52:32.269 --> 02:52:32.279 align:start position:0%
legislators that had worked on this and
 
02:52:34.130 --> 02:52:34.140 align:start position:0%
and you know when I heard that they had
 
02:52:37.010 --> 02:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
said that I wanted to to put to figure
 
02:52:38.809 --> 02:52:38.819 align:start position:0%
out if this was already happening in New
 
02:52:41.389 --> 02:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if not put it in
 
02:52:43.969 --> 02:52:43.979 align:start position:0%
um after I put it in a not just a
 
02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
constituent but actually a neighbor of
 
02:52:47.210 --> 02:52:47.220 align:start position:0%
mine who lives in the apartment complex
 
02:52:49.070 --> 02:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
I live in
 
02:52:52.130 --> 02:52:52.140 align:start position:0%
um did in fact acquire a new disability
 
02:52:55.309 --> 02:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
the loss of her legs she is on the third
 
02:52:58.610 --> 02:52:58.620 align:start position:0%
floor of the building next to me and
 
02:53:00.410 --> 02:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
um she's been working with legal
 
02:53:03.050 --> 02:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
assistants to try to to get out of that
 
02:53:04.309 --> 02:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
situation but she's essentially
 
02:53:07.370 --> 02:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
homebound so these are based on real
 
02:53:10.190 --> 02:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
world situations I've
 
02:53:11.870 --> 02:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
um and by the way in the bill that
 
02:53:13.610 --> 02:53:13.620 align:start position:0%
requires documentation for both you
 
02:53:15.230 --> 02:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
don't just say that you're a victim you
 
02:53:17.450 --> 02:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
have to have police reports or a order
 
02:53:19.550 --> 02:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
of protection from a judge that has
 
02:53:21.950 --> 02:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
declared after hearing that you are in
 
02:53:24.290 --> 02:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
fact a victim of stalking or domestic
 
02:53:24.300 --> 02:53:25.610 align:start position:0%
fact a victim of stalking or domestic
violence

02:53:25.610 --> 02:53:25.620 align:start position:0%
violence
 
02:53:27.889 --> 02:53:27.899 align:start position:0%
um and obviously medical documentation
 
02:53:29.929 --> 02:53:29.939 align:start position:0%
in the case of a new disability that
 
02:53:32.230 --> 02:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
you've acquired since signing the lease
 
02:53:36.469 --> 02:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
so that's the basics of the bill I have
 
02:53:39.349 --> 02:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
struggled internally about presenting
 
02:53:40.330 --> 02:53:40.340 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:53:44.090 --> 02:53:44.100 align:start position:0%
in terms of how much do I say because I
 
02:53:45.950 --> 02:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
have a story to tell
 
02:53:48.530 --> 02:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
but I haven't been public in terms of my
 
02:53:49.969 --> 02:53:49.979 align:start position:0%
life at the State House in the last six
 
02:53:52.790 --> 02:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
years about it I am from Tennessee I
 
02:53:55.190 --> 02:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
grew up in the in South Memphis a very
 
02:53:57.050 --> 02:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
poor neighborhood and I was pretty
 
02:53:59.630 --> 02:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
isolated and not
 
02:54:02.269 --> 02:54:02.279 align:start position:0%
really socialized into what red flags
 
02:54:05.269 --> 02:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
would be for a relationship and so at
 
02:54:07.010 --> 02:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
the age of 17 when a boy took interest
 
02:54:08.630 --> 02:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
in me and I just thought the world of
 
02:54:10.910 --> 02:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
him I got involved in my first serious
 
02:54:12.769 --> 02:54:12.779 align:start position:0%
relationship he turned out to be
 
02:54:15.830 --> 02:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
extremely abusive had multiple warrants
 
02:54:17.750 --> 02:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
in other states
 
02:54:20.450 --> 02:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
um he held me captive for three days he
 
02:54:24.050 --> 02:54:24.060 align:start position:0%
hit me with a car the FBI FBI got
 
02:54:26.630 --> 02:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
involved at one point when after I got
 
02:54:28.730 --> 02:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
out he continued to stalk me for 16
 
02:54:30.650 --> 02:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
years and sent death threats across
 
02:54:32.450 --> 02:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
state lines
 
02:54:35.630 --> 02:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
um he finally stopped in 2016 when he
 
02:54:37.969 --> 02:54:37.979 align:start position:0%
committed suicide uh the year I got
 
02:54:37.979 --> 02:54:39.290 align:start position:0%
committed suicide uh the year I got
elected

02:54:39.290 --> 02:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
elected
 
02:54:43.370 --> 02:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
when I got when I escaped from him I had
 
02:54:44.630 --> 02:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
nowhere to go
 
02:54:48.469 --> 02:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
and was forced into a series of kind of
 
02:54:50.510 --> 02:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
like shacking up with different friends
 
02:54:53.389 --> 02:54:53.399 align:start position:0%
and and relatives and things
 
02:54:56.030 --> 02:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'm glad that I didn't I wasn't on the
 
02:54:57.830 --> 02:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
lease the original lease because I would
 
02:54:59.630 --> 02:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
have had an impossible time finally
 
02:55:03.469 --> 02:55:03.479 align:start position:0%
finding renting rental housing which I
 
02:55:05.510 --> 02:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
was able to find because I didn't have a
 
02:55:08.690 --> 02:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
history of an eviction on my record but
 
02:55:11.030 --> 02:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
if I had been on that lease I would have
 
02:55:14.269 --> 02:55:14.279 align:start position:0%
been forced into an impossible situation
 
02:55:16.309 --> 02:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
I would have been forced to stay with my
 
02:55:19.309 --> 02:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
captor or have an eviction on my or have
 
02:55:20.530 --> 02:55:20.540 align:start position:0%
a um
 
02:55:23.690 --> 02:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
essentially be evicted or have the the
 
02:55:25.570 --> 02:55:25.580 align:start position:0%
non-payment on my history and being
 
02:55:29.830 --> 02:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
unable to find a place to live
 
02:55:34.849 --> 02:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
so that's my piece of the story and why
 
02:55:36.530 --> 02:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
when I found out that my Tennessee
 
02:55:38.450 --> 02:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
legislator friends had put it in I
 
02:55:40.670 --> 02:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
really wanted to make sure this got in
 
02:55:42.650 --> 02:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
but as I said it's pretty
 
02:55:44.630 --> 02:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
straightforward you have to have legal
 
02:55:46.550 --> 02:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
documentation of either the domestic
 
02:55:48.710 --> 02:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
violence or stalking or the medical
 
02:55:51.790 --> 02:55:51.800 align:start position:0%
documentation of a new disability
 
02:55:54.410 --> 02:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
and it just lets you leave without
 
02:55:57.610 --> 02:55:57.620 align:start position:0%
penalty so that you're not forced into
 
02:56:00.530 --> 02:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
essentially into a situation a
 
02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
relationship that can lead to you dying
 
02:56:05.269 --> 02:56:05.279 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should penalize people
 
02:56:07.010 --> 02:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
for for surviving
 
02:56:09.410 --> 02:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
and that's what I have and I'm happy to
 
02:56:11.389 --> 02:56:11.399 align:start position:0%
take questions questions representative
 
02:56:11.399 --> 02:56:13.010 align:start position:0%
take questions questions representative
page

02:56:13.010 --> 02:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:56:14.750 --> 02:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and thank you
 
02:56:16.849 --> 02:56:16.859 align:start position:0%
for sharing your stories as hard as it
 
02:56:17.870 --> 02:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
might be
 
02:56:20.929 --> 02:56:20.939 align:start position:0%
I have a question that relates to and my
 
02:56:23.110 --> 02:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the federal
 
02:56:26.210 --> 02:56:26.220 align:start position:0%
laws in this area are minimal at best so
 
02:56:28.010 --> 02:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
bear with me you're probably much more
 
02:56:30.710 --> 02:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
expert than I am I doubt it
 
02:56:33.230 --> 02:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is a federal uh
 
02:56:35.210 --> 02:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
similar law that applies to public
 
02:56:38.150 --> 02:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
housing situations that has a lower
 
02:56:40.670 --> 02:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
standard than this bill would propose in
 
02:56:41.889 --> 02:56:41.899 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
02:56:44.750 --> 02:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
providing documentation or reason and I
 
02:56:47.389 --> 02:56:47.399 align:start position:0%
think itself attestation
 
02:56:50.929 --> 02:56:50.939 align:start position:0%
um so my question is could you if you
 
02:56:53.389 --> 02:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
know about that what that would look
 
02:56:56.150 --> 02:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
like self-attestation in terms of making
 
02:56:59.990 --> 02:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
sure there's um a unanimity across
 
02:57:02.870 --> 02:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
private and public housing situations
 
02:57:05.870 --> 02:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
for these same situations so what would
 
02:57:08.990 --> 02:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
that look like for uh private leases and
 
02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:10.070 align:start position:0%
that look like for uh private leases and
then

02:57:10.070 --> 02:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:57:11.870 --> 02:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
um second second to that on the
 
02:57:14.830 --> 02:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
protective order piece uh that this bill
 
02:57:17.990 --> 02:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
requires could you describe how that
 
02:57:19.730 --> 02:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
might implicate the landlord would the
 
02:57:22.429 --> 02:57:22.439 align:start position:0%
landlord be a witness to this that sort
 
02:57:25.429 --> 02:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
of thing so so do you see my my point I
 
02:57:27.170 --> 02:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
think in terms of the two-tier kind of
 
02:57:29.809 --> 02:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
idea let me yes I do and let me try to
 
02:57:32.330 --> 02:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
address those in reverse order so
 
02:57:35.210 --> 02:57:35.220 align:start position:0%
so no in fact the reason the bill is a
 
02:57:36.410 --> 02:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
little bit longer than you would expect
 
02:57:38.450 --> 02:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
is because there's a piece of privacy
 
02:57:41.750 --> 02:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
that landlord's not abled once a tenant
 
02:57:43.910 --> 02:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
says this is the reason I have to leave
 
02:57:47.630 --> 02:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
my lease you can't penalize me
 
02:57:50.809 --> 02:57:50.819 align:start position:0%
um they give that documentation but the
 
02:57:53.210 --> 02:57:53.220 align:start position:0%
landlord then is basically has to hold
 
02:57:56.990 --> 02:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
that as confidential so the landlord
 
02:57:59.150 --> 02:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't enter into the picture
 
02:58:01.490 --> 02:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
I mean unless for other reasons that you
 
02:58:02.990 --> 02:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
would right like if there's some reason
 
02:58:04.370 --> 02:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
if the landlord happened to be present
 
02:58:06.170 --> 02:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
and witness something then anyway
 
02:58:08.269 --> 02:58:08.279 align:start position:0%
regardless of this bill you might want
 
02:58:09.889 --> 02:58:09.899 align:start position:0%
to call them in as a witness but there's
 
02:58:11.570 --> 02:58:11.580 align:start position:0%
no reason that the with this bill that
 
02:58:13.250 --> 02:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
the landlord enters the picture before
 
02:58:14.809 --> 02:58:14.819 align:start position:0%
the order of protection either the
 
02:58:16.910 --> 02:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
emergency order of protection or the
 
02:58:19.490 --> 02:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
hearing so that it's just it's not part
 
02:58:20.870 --> 02:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
you would get that order of protection
 
02:58:23.090 --> 02:58:23.100 align:start position:0%
first and then give it to the to the
 
02:58:25.550 --> 02:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
landlord for the other piece so I'm like
 
02:58:26.929 --> 02:58:26.939 align:start position:0%
I said I modeled this after the
 
02:58:30.530 --> 02:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
Tennessee law and the Tennessee law is
 
02:58:31.969 --> 02:58:31.979 align:start position:0%
probably a little bit
 
02:58:34.849 --> 02:58:34.859 align:start position:0%
um less aggressive in terms of
 
02:58:37.670 --> 02:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
protecting tenants than maybe the
 
02:58:41.210 --> 02:58:41.220 align:start position:0%
federal standard so me wanting to just
 
02:58:43.070 --> 02:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
get something passed I went with what I
 
02:58:44.450 --> 02:58:44.460 align:start position:0%
thought would be the easier thing to
 
02:58:46.130 --> 02:58:46.140 align:start position:0%
pass but
 
02:58:48.110 --> 02:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
um it does make sense to match the
 
02:58:50.870 --> 02:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
public housing piece so if the committee
 
02:58:54.769 --> 02:58:54.779 align:start position:0%
were so inclined to match that level in
 
02:58:57.769 --> 02:58:57.779 align:start position:0%
terms of attestation I understand it is
 
02:58:58.730 --> 02:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
something along the lines of an
 
02:59:01.250 --> 02:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
affidavit it so I'm signing I'm telling
 
02:59:03.889 --> 02:59:03.899 align:start position:0%
you you know that this is a a legally
 
02:59:06.769 --> 02:59:06.779 align:start position:0%
true statement that I have been a victim
 
02:59:09.950 --> 02:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence for example so
 
02:59:13.130 --> 02:59:13.140 align:start position:0%
um so yeah so that's a is a lower bar if
 
02:59:14.570 --> 02:59:14.580 align:start position:0%
this committee were so inclined we could
 
02:59:16.849 --> 02:59:16.859 align:start position:0%
go to that and make it uniform between
 
02:59:19.550 --> 02:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
public housing and private
 
02:59:21.349 --> 02:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
um but what is before you right now is
 
02:59:24.530 --> 02:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
the easier ask once again
 
02:59:26.809 --> 02:59:26.819 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
02:59:29.870 --> 02:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative D Lorenzo
 
02:59:31.870 --> 02:59:31.880 align:start position:0%
my question um
 
02:59:34.849 --> 02:59:34.859 align:start position:0%
while representative page was speaking I
 
02:59:34.859 --> 02:59:36.170 align:start position:0%
while representative page was speaking I
was

02:59:36.170 --> 02:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:59:38.150 --> 02:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
distracted a little bit uh because
 
02:59:42.349 --> 02:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
someone sent me a text but I wanted to
 
02:59:44.990 --> 02:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
know if you are aware that um the
 
02:59:47.690 --> 02:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
Violence Against Woman Act
 
02:59:50.330 --> 02:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
um applies to any husband with federal
 
02:59:50.340 --> 02:59:52.250 align:start position:0%
um applies to any husband with federal
funds

02:59:52.250 --> 02:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:59:54.110 --> 02:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
so I think that's probably similar to
 
02:59:56.690 --> 02:59:56.700 align:start position:0%
what was just brought up but again
 
02:59:58.429 --> 02:59:58.439 align:start position:0%
housing with federal funds is different
 
03:00:01.309 --> 03:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
than all all rentals in this state so
 
03:00:03.410 --> 03:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
that's this is again modeling after
 
03:00:05.870 --> 03:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
Tennessee and other states that have
 
03:00:09.170 --> 03:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
passed this would apply to all housing
 
03:00:10.370 --> 03:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
03:00:11.929 --> 03:00:11.939 align:start position:0%
thank you another question
 
03:00:11.939 --> 03:00:13.429 align:start position:0%
thank you another question
representative

03:00:13.429 --> 03:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:00:15.349 --> 03:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks and and thanks uh
 
03:00:16.910 --> 03:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative Reed uh I just want to
 
03:00:19.250 --> 03:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
draw out sort of underlying purpose um
 
03:00:20.990 --> 03:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
it seems as though like with the
 
03:00:22.790 --> 03:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
examples and such I wasn't totally clear
 
03:00:25.550 --> 03:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
is one of the underlying causes for
 
03:00:29.389 --> 03:00:29.399 align:start position:0%
something like this the ability to
 
03:00:29.399 --> 03:00:29.990 align:start position:0%
something like this the ability to
um

03:00:29.990 --> 03:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:34.070 --> 03:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
remove the uh knowledge of that person's
 
03:00:37.730 --> 03:00:37.740 align:start position:0%
address from sort of the the abusers
 
03:00:40.929 --> 03:00:40.939 align:start position:0%
um uh awareness so basically the
 
03:00:43.130 --> 03:00:43.140 align:start position:0%
breaking your lease essentially because
 
03:00:45.889 --> 03:00:45.899 align:start position:0%
just having knowledge of where you live
 
03:00:48.410 --> 03:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
is a danger to you through the stalking
 
03:00:50.150 --> 03:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
piece for the stocking person correct
 
03:00:52.490 --> 03:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
yes right
 
03:00:55.250 --> 03:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness thank
 
03:00:57.710 --> 03:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
you very much ma'am thank you so much
 
03:01:02.330 --> 03:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:04.309 --> 03:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
03:01:07.070 --> 03:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
committee my name is David Klein I'm not
 
03:01:09.290 --> 03:01:09.300 align:start position:0%
against I'm speaking against the bill
 
03:01:11.090 --> 03:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
but it's more of a structural issue than
 
03:01:12.530 --> 03:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
03:01:12.540 --> 03:01:13.130 align:start position:0%
anything else
um

03:01:13.130 --> 03:01:13.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:15.110 --> 03:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
as a practical matter if we have a
 
03:01:18.050 --> 03:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
tenant that is in the situation of the
 
03:01:20.210 --> 03:01:20.220 align:start position:0%
type that are alluded to that that being
 
03:01:22.610 --> 03:01:22.620 align:start position:0%
stalked or a victim and they can't live
 
03:01:22.620 --> 03:01:23.630 align:start position:0%
stalked or a victim and they can't live
there

03:01:23.630 --> 03:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:01:26.570 --> 03:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
those problems will permeate through the
 
03:01:28.969 --> 03:01:28.979 align:start position:0%
whole building incidents may happen it's
 
03:01:30.650 --> 03:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
in our interest as a landlord for them
 
03:01:32.929 --> 03:01:32.939 align:start position:0%
to go also perfectly willing to work
 
03:01:33.889 --> 03:01:33.899 align:start position:0%
with them
 
03:01:35.389 --> 03:01:35.399 align:start position:0%
and what I do like about the way the
 
03:01:37.790 --> 03:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
bill is worked now set up now in the
 
03:01:39.769 --> 03:01:39.779 align:start position:0%
first section is that it's clear
 
03:01:43.309 --> 03:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
documentation we have a 173b action
 
03:01:45.290 --> 03:01:45.300 align:start position:0%
where a judge rules that there is a
 
03:01:47.450 --> 03:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
problem or you have a real police
 
03:01:50.030 --> 03:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
department report with criminal action
 
03:01:52.550 --> 03:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
may be brought against stalker
 
03:01:56.570 --> 03:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
or or the perpetrator of the abuse so
 
03:01:58.010 --> 03:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
that we have some protections from the
 
03:01:59.809 --> 03:01:59.819 align:start position:0%
landlord so we know that this tenant is
 
03:02:02.450 --> 03:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
real where I'm having problems is the
 
03:02:05.210 --> 03:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
second half of the bill would be dealing
 
03:02:07.849 --> 03:02:07.859 align:start position:0%
with the person who's disabled if you
 
03:02:09.349 --> 03:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
look at it it doesn't say medical
 
03:02:12.650 --> 03:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
provider it just says documentation it's
 
03:02:15.830 --> 03:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
very unclear as to what's going on or
 
03:02:19.610 --> 03:02:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:21.769 --> 03:02:21.779 align:start position:0%
and also the standard the rental
 
03:02:24.650 --> 03:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
property is no longer enjoyable for use
 
03:02:26.690 --> 03:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
of the tenant I don't know what that
 
03:02:28.130 --> 03:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
term is supposed to mean and I think
 
03:02:29.809 --> 03:02:29.819 align:start position:0%
that term has to be Rewritten and
 
03:02:32.690 --> 03:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
thought out doesn't mean they don't like
 
03:02:34.190 --> 03:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
the color of the bathroom paint so it's
 
03:02:36.290 --> 03:02:36.300 align:start position:0%
no longer enjoyable
 
03:02:38.570 --> 03:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
and obviously if someone is disabled and
 
03:02:40.130 --> 03:02:40.140 align:start position:0%
not working cannot afford the apartment
 
03:02:42.110 --> 03:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
the best is for everybody for this
 
03:02:44.090 --> 03:02:44.100 align:start position:0%
person to leave avoid any of the
 
03:02:46.309 --> 03:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
eviction process don't even have to deal
 
03:02:48.889 --> 03:02:48.899 align:start position:0%
with mediation although that's not
 
03:02:50.389 --> 03:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
mandatory but you know this is the type
 
03:02:51.290 --> 03:02:51.300 align:start position:0%
of thing that would work out in
 
03:02:51.300 --> 03:02:52.370 align:start position:0%
of thing that would work out in
mediation

03:02:52.370 --> 03:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
mediation
 
03:02:55.849 --> 03:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
so what I'm suggesting to the
 
03:02:58.309 --> 03:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
um committee is that
 
03:03:00.410 --> 03:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
have this the second half of this bill
 
03:03:02.750 --> 03:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
Rewritten make it so that there are some
 
03:03:04.550 --> 03:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
real standards that we can hang our hat
 
03:03:07.610 --> 03:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
on and understand that this person is
 
03:03:10.370 --> 03:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
disabled not just someone coming in and
 
03:03:13.130 --> 03:03:13.140 align:start position:0%
saying hey I got in a car accident I
 
03:03:15.830 --> 03:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
can't walk and no doctor is opining on
 
03:03:15.840 --> 03:03:16.730 align:start position:0%
can't walk and no doctor is opining on
it

03:03:16.730 --> 03:03:16.740 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:03:19.309 --> 03:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
and get some medical and get some real
 
03:03:21.410 --> 03:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
reasons that there's a causal connection
 
03:03:23.929 --> 03:03:23.939 align:start position:0%
between the injury and the inability to
 
03:03:25.610 --> 03:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
use the apartment
 
03:03:27.410 --> 03:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak on
 
03:03:28.849 --> 03:03:28.859 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:03:31.429 --> 03:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
thank you sir questions for this Witness
 
03:03:36.710 --> 03:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:39.530 --> 03:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of the uh of the case of a
 
03:03:42.590 --> 03:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh friend of mine a fellow rep who
 
03:03:45.050 --> 03:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
moved to a uh one of the large rental
 
03:03:46.849 --> 03:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
communities out on the Heights and I
 
03:03:48.889 --> 03:03:48.899 align:start position:0%
don't think she had any problems working
 
03:03:51.769 --> 03:03:51.779 align:start position:0%
things out with her landlord but she was
 
03:03:53.990 --> 03:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
her disability became
 
03:03:56.030 --> 03:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
worse over the several years as she's
 
03:03:58.849 --> 03:03:58.859 align:start position:0%
living there and in the last uh
 
03:04:00.889 --> 03:04:00.899 align:start position:0%
that she she was in that case the
 
03:04:02.210 --> 03:04:02.220 align:start position:0%
apartment had some handicapped
 
03:04:04.910 --> 03:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
accessible uh units and they they placed
 
03:04:08.870 --> 03:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
her at once so like uh with this bill
 
03:04:11.809 --> 03:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
would this bill make it easier for a
 
03:04:14.210 --> 03:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
tendon whose landlord has
 
03:04:17.330 --> 03:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
handicapped accessible units to uh
 
03:04:19.670 --> 03:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
you know be on the have higher priority
 
03:04:23.090 --> 03:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
for moving into one of those when um if
 
03:04:24.950 --> 03:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
he or she becomes disabled while living
 
03:04:24.960 --> 03:04:26.510 align:start position:0%
he or she becomes disabled while living
there

03:04:26.510 --> 03:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:04:28.190 --> 03:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
I don't think the bill does I mean
 
03:04:30.230 --> 03:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
because the the op the option for the
 
03:04:32.929 --> 03:04:32.939 align:start position:0%
tenant is to terminate if if you know
 
03:04:34.670 --> 03:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
once we set up the standards of what it
 
03:04:36.590 --> 03:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
is now if the landlord has an apartment
 
03:04:39.170 --> 03:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
or office it of course it's up to the
 
03:04:40.610 --> 03:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
negotiation between the landlord and
 
03:04:43.610 --> 03:04:43.620 align:start position:0%
tenant but the only thing in the bill is
 
03:04:45.349 --> 03:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
termination that's the only option
 
03:04:47.929 --> 03:04:47.939 align:start position:0%
that's given
 
03:04:50.150 --> 03:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
yes uh I think representative De Lorenzo
 
03:04:51.370 --> 03:04:51.380 align:start position:0%
was next and I'll get to Europe
 
03:04:54.410 --> 03:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
representative Lorenzo thank you Mr here
 
03:04:56.450 --> 03:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question Mr
 
03:04:56.460 --> 03:04:57.590 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question Mr
Klein

03:04:57.590 --> 03:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
Klein
 
03:04:59.330 --> 03:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned
 
03:05:02.769 --> 03:05:02.779 align:start position:0%
um said a verification of disability
 
03:05:08.570 --> 03:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
for a tenant who wants a change right so
 
03:05:10.370 --> 03:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
there is a federal reasonable
 
03:05:14.269 --> 03:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
accommodation form that's um used for
 
03:05:16.670 --> 03:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
housing and that would be in the house
 
03:05:19.130 --> 03:05:19.140 align:start position:0%
HUD handbook I could get it online but
 
03:05:21.110 --> 03:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
that has the right the right questions
 
03:05:23.929 --> 03:05:23.939 align:start position:0%
to ask and the right standards and it
 
03:05:25.910 --> 03:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
goes to a person's health care
 
03:05:28.370 --> 03:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
professional generally a doctor or a
 
03:05:31.429 --> 03:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
nurse or whatever thank you
 
03:05:33.889 --> 03:05:33.899 align:start position:0%
all right a representative page I think
 
03:05:35.570 --> 03:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
you had a question yeah thank you thank
 
03:05:36.889 --> 03:05:36.899 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thanks for taking my
 
03:05:36.899 --> 03:05:38.150 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thanks for taking my
question

03:05:38.150 --> 03:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:05:40.429 --> 03:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
um I have a question related to the
 
03:05:43.130 --> 03:05:43.140 align:start position:0%
verification it's the question I was
 
03:05:44.630 --> 03:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
asking representative Reed earlier on
 
03:05:46.790 --> 03:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
the federal standard which seems to be a
 
03:05:49.130 --> 03:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
lower standard let me just and bear with
 
03:05:49.140 --> 03:05:49.969 align:start position:0%
lower standard let me just and bear with
me

03:05:49.969 --> 03:05:49.979 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
um and that required for cases of sexual
 
03:05:54.710 --> 03:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
violence and domestic abuse that require
 
03:05:56.750 --> 03:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
basically the person to sign an
 
03:05:59.870 --> 03:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
affidavit and you had mentioned that you
 
03:06:02.150 --> 03:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
thought that a strength of the bill was
 
03:06:05.090 --> 03:06:05.100 align:start position:0%
that verification requirement I'm
 
03:06:07.809 --> 03:06:07.819 align:start position:0%
wondering if you would agree with me
 
03:06:12.469 --> 03:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
that the chances are probably low that
 
03:06:15.290 --> 03:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
someone would sign an affidavit on their
 
03:06:15.300 --> 03:06:16.630 align:start position:0%
someone would sign an affidavit on their
own

03:06:16.630 --> 03:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
own
 
03:06:19.490 --> 03:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
claiming to be victims of sexual
 
03:06:22.370 --> 03:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
violence or domestic abuse in order to
 
03:06:24.769 --> 03:06:24.779 align:start position:0%
get out of a lease would that be fair no
 
03:06:27.170 --> 03:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
I disagree with you
 
03:06:29.929 --> 03:06:29.939 align:start position:0%
and thank you all right all right other
 
03:06:33.290 --> 03:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
questions on that Mr chairman just
 
03:06:37.250 --> 03:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
briefly very briefly I didn't
 
03:06:39.050 --> 03:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
um I'm retired now but it did represent
 
03:06:40.610 --> 03:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
a number of people in divorce actions
 
03:06:43.670 --> 03:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
when I was practicing law and there were
 
03:06:46.010 --> 03:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
a number of instances where to gain
 
03:06:47.690 --> 03:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
advantage on custody and things like
 
03:06:49.610 --> 03:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
that people would sign affidavits even
 
03:06:51.349 --> 03:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
though it was perjury
 
03:06:54.230 --> 03:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh to get that Advantage so I can see
 
03:06:55.730 --> 03:06:55.740 align:start position:0%
somebody once out of a lease just doing
 
03:06:58.010 --> 03:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
that all right very easily other
 
03:06:59.809 --> 03:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
03:07:02.990 --> 03:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir
 
03:07:06.590 --> 03:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
all right uh uh Pamela Kiley and Rachel
 
03:07:06.600 --> 03:07:20.290 align:start position:0%
all right uh uh Pamela Kiley and Rachel
Duffy

03:07:20.290 --> 03:07:20.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:23.030 --> 03:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair and members of
 
03:07:25.309 --> 03:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Pamela kylig
 
03:07:27.349 --> 03:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
and I am the public policy specialist at
 
03:07:28.610 --> 03:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Coalition against
 
03:07:30.950 --> 03:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual Violence uh the
 
03:07:32.809 --> 03:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
Coalition is the umbrella Organization
 
03:07:34.790 --> 03:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
for our 12 community-based crisis
 
03:07:36.590 --> 03:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
centers who provide free and
 
03:07:39.170 --> 03:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
confidential services to nearly 15 000
 
03:07:41.090 --> 03:07:41.100 align:start position:0%
survivors of sexual and domestic
 
03:07:44.630 --> 03:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
violence annually I'm here to speak in
 
03:07:47.210 --> 03:07:47.220 align:start position:0%
support of HB 261 but have some
 
03:07:49.010 --> 03:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
recommendations for some amendments that
 
03:07:52.130 --> 03:07:52.140 align:start position:0%
we would like the committee to consider
 
03:07:54.230 --> 03:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
um and I'm also here with my colleague
 
03:07:56.570 --> 03:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
Rachel Duffy who is the coalition's
 
03:07:58.730 --> 03:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
housing and economic Justice manager who
 
03:08:00.490 --> 03:08:00.500 align:start position:0%
can provide some educational background
 
03:08:03.530 --> 03:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
in terms of housing rights for survivors
 
03:08:05.870 --> 03:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
and protections for survivors
 
03:08:07.790 --> 03:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
um so again we support the overall
 
03:08:10.849 --> 03:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
intent of this legislation but some
 
03:08:12.410 --> 03:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
similar to some of the points that have
 
03:08:13.910 --> 03:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
already been brought up by the committee
 
03:08:15.349 --> 03:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
we just want to make sure that the
 
03:08:18.290 --> 03:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
standard is the same regardless of the
 
03:08:19.790 --> 03:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
type of housing that a survive driver
 
03:08:21.769 --> 03:08:21.779 align:start position:0%
lives in and so that we're not having a
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
two-tiered system when it comes to those
 
03:08:26.269 --> 03:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
rights regardless of whether someone is
 
03:08:28.730 --> 03:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
in public or private housing
 
03:08:32.630 --> 03:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
um and so I I think just briefly um and
 
03:08:34.790 --> 03:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
then I'll let my colleagues speak
 
03:08:36.950 --> 03:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
um we feel that
 
03:08:36.960 --> 03:08:37.550 align:start position:0%
um we feel that
um

03:08:37.550 --> 03:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:41.030 --> 03:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
we'll just we feel that the um the
 
03:08:43.070 --> 03:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
threshold is really high right now and
 
03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
again goes against the standard on the
 
03:08:46.849 --> 03:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
federal level we're worried about
 
03:08:48.950 --> 03:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
potential confidentiality or safety
 
03:08:51.290 --> 03:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
risks that could come with this policy
 
03:08:54.230 --> 03:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
as written and there's a couple tweaks
 
03:08:56.330 --> 03:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
for the definition section that we feel
 
03:08:59.090 --> 03:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed just to make sure
 
03:09:00.469 --> 03:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
everything is aligned with current
 
03:09:00.479 --> 03:09:04.130 align:start position:0%
everything is aligned with current
statute

03:09:04.130 --> 03:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:05.809 --> 03:09:05.819 align:start position:0%

03:09:18.590 --> 03:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
particular interest in HB 261 as we

03:09:59.330 --> 03:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
their own homes and Advocates know and
 
03:10:01.190 --> 03:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
understand that when housing survivors
 
03:10:02.630 --> 03:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
there are exceptional considerations
 
03:10:05.450 --> 03:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
that need to to be made including safety
 
03:10:07.130 --> 03:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
and confidentiality
 
03:10:09.910 --> 03:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
so as previously mentioned
 
03:10:12.530 --> 03:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
there are some current federal housing
 
03:10:14.870 --> 03:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
Protections in place specifically for
 
03:10:17.570 --> 03:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
those who are in public housing and that
 
03:10:19.910 --> 03:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
is uh vawa and I'd like to speak a
 
03:10:21.889 --> 03:10:21.899 align:start position:0%
little bit more to how that was
 
03:10:25.130 --> 03:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
structured So currently survivors of
 
03:10:26.929 --> 03:10:26.939 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual Violence who reside
 
03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
in Housing Programs have protections
 
03:10:31.030 --> 03:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
through vawa such as
 
03:10:35.450 --> 03:10:35.460 align:start position:0%
bifurcation of lease they are able to
 
03:10:38.469 --> 03:10:38.479 align:start position:0%
break their lease and request
 
03:10:40.969 --> 03:10:40.979 align:start position:0%
essentially a transfer to a different
 
03:10:43.670 --> 03:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
apartment through a public housing
 
03:10:43.680 --> 03:10:44.830 align:start position:0%
apartment through a public housing
agency

03:10:44.830 --> 03:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
agency
 
03:10:48.110 --> 03:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
as mentioned too there's also the
 
03:10:52.010 --> 03:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
ability to provide a self-attestation So
 
03:10:55.969 --> 03:10:55.979 align:start position:0%
within this this particular bill it is
 
03:10:59.230 --> 03:10:59.240 align:start position:0%
requesting for a police report or
 
03:11:02.450 --> 03:11:02.460 align:start position:0%
potential restraining order and many
 
03:11:04.969 --> 03:11:04.979 align:start position:0%
Survivor situations don't actually rise
 
03:11:06.889 --> 03:11:06.899 align:start position:0%
to the situation where a protective
 
03:11:11.210 --> 03:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
order order may be granted and so we
 
03:11:12.950 --> 03:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
just feel that that threshold is quite
 
03:11:16.510 --> 03:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
High vawa really is the standard
 
03:11:21.530 --> 03:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
of housing practice and it was created
 
03:11:23.210 --> 03:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
through the extensive input and
 
03:11:25.010 --> 03:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
collaboration between victim Advocate
 
03:11:25.020 --> 03:11:25.990 align:start position:0%
collaboration between victim Advocate
Community

03:11:25.990 --> 03:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
Community
 
03:11:28.610 --> 03:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
survivors housing Advocates as well as
 
03:11:31.490 --> 03:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
government agencies such as HUD so we
 
03:11:34.190 --> 03:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
really do feel that there should be an
 
03:11:37.309 --> 03:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
alignment between the state and federal
 
03:11:37.319 --> 03:11:40.070 align:start position:0%
alignment between the state and federal
policy

03:11:40.070 --> 03:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
policy
 
03:11:42.170 --> 03:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
um additionally I would like to talk
 
03:11:42.180 --> 03:11:43.429 align:start position:0%
um additionally I would like to talk
about

03:11:43.429 --> 03:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:11:43.439 --> 03:11:44.650 align:start position:0%
about
um

03:11:44.650 --> 03:11:44.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:47.450 --> 03:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
no no go ahead but just bear in mind
 
03:11:49.670 --> 03:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
we're kind of getting close on time okay
 
03:11:51.290 --> 03:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
yep thank you
 
03:11:53.809 --> 03:11:53.819 align:start position:0%
um I think to summarize we also you know
 
03:11:56.630 --> 03:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
to the point uh part two section uh B
 
03:11:59.389 --> 03:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
just on the amount of time that it takes
 
03:12:01.610 --> 03:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
or sorry the amount of time that a uh
 
03:12:04.070 --> 03:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
Survivor has to provide notice um it's
 
03:12:06.710 --> 03:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
60 days that the crime had to have
 
03:12:09.950 --> 03:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
occurred within this bill and um a lot
 
03:12:11.450 --> 03:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
of times survivors just need a lot more
 
03:12:13.670 --> 03:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
time to accumulate evidence and they
 
03:12:15.410 --> 03:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
need to seek additional Services before
 
03:12:20.210 --> 03:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
that they can move forward uh to um to
 
03:12:23.030 --> 03:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
go through this process and HP 261
 
03:12:25.809 --> 03:12:25.819 align:start position:0%
doesn't clearly Define
 
03:12:27.950 --> 03:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
confidentiality policies to the extent
 
03:12:29.750 --> 03:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
that vawa does and so we would ask that
 
03:12:32.950 --> 03:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
that be taken into consideration
 
03:12:35.090 --> 03:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
I'm charged or something else yeah just
 
03:12:36.650 --> 03:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
one more thing I'm sorry thank you Mr
 
03:12:36.660 --> 03:12:37.730 align:start position:0%
one more thing I'm sorry thank you Mr
chair

03:12:37.730 --> 03:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:12:39.410 --> 03:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
um just again just to speak to those
 
03:12:41.389 --> 03:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
definitions um we're concerned that the
 
03:12:42.950 --> 03:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
definition of household isn't broad
 
03:12:44.570 --> 03:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
enough to consider roommate or
 
03:12:47.630 --> 03:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
cohabitation situations if in cases of
 
03:12:49.730 --> 03:12:49.740 align:start position:0%
stalking by a neighbor where only one
 
03:12:52.010 --> 03:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
roommate the victim would be eligible to
 
03:12:53.750 --> 03:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
break the lease and that could cause
 
03:12:55.870 --> 03:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
housing Jeopardy and then additionally
 
03:12:58.790 --> 03:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
we just ask that the committee consider
 
03:13:01.429 --> 03:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
using the definitions that's already in
 
03:13:04.969 --> 03:13:04.979 align:start position:0%
statute under RSA 540 when referring to
 
03:13:08.809 --> 03:13:08.819 align:start position:0%
domestic violence in in RSA 173b there
 
03:13:11.389 --> 03:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
is actually no definition for victim of
 
03:13:13.370 --> 03:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse they're defining the
 
03:13:15.530 --> 03:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
crime of domestic violence so we just
 
03:13:16.849 --> 03:13:16.859 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that everything is in
 
03:13:18.950 --> 03:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
alignment thank you so much questions
 
03:13:20.269 --> 03:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
representative pay
 
03:13:22.070 --> 03:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
03:13:23.450 --> 03:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:13:24.950 --> 03:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
um this relates to the affidavit or
 
03:13:26.929 --> 03:13:26.939 align:start position:0%
self-attestation requirement
 
03:13:28.429 --> 03:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
um in your experience and I'm assuming
 
03:13:30.910 --> 03:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
you have experience with the federal law
 
03:13:33.469 --> 03:13:33.479 align:start position:0%
to what extent or what degree or what
 
03:13:37.250 --> 03:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
percentage would you say when a person
 
03:13:39.889 --> 03:13:39.899 align:start position:0%
is coming to you and willing to sign a
 
03:13:42.050 --> 03:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
affidavit indicating they're a victim of
 
03:13:45.290 --> 03:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse or sexual assault what
 
03:13:47.690 --> 03:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
percentage of those do you believe are
 
03:13:51.110 --> 03:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
truly cases that sexual assault or
 
03:13:53.809 --> 03:13:53.819 align:start position:0%
domestic violence well I would say just
 
03:13:55.910 --> 03:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
from the coalition's perspective we
 
03:13:58.670 --> 03:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
always believe survivors we work the ad
 
03:14:00.610 --> 03:14:00.620 align:start position:0%
Advocates that work directly with
 
03:14:00.620 --> 03:14:03.010 align:start position:0%
Advocates that work directly with
survivors

03:14:03.010 --> 03:14:03.020 align:start position:0%
survivors
 
03:14:07.610 --> 03:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
we we take their word
 
03:14:09.610 --> 03:14:09.620 align:start position:0%
um and we
 
03:14:11.990 --> 03:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
oftentimes work with them to develop
 
03:14:14.330 --> 03:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
different types of evidence that they
 
03:14:16.670 --> 03:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
can put forward such as a letter of
 
03:14:19.010 --> 03:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
support from an um a domestic violence
 
03:14:23.210 --> 03:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
agency or a medical provider or
 
03:14:27.830 --> 03:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
um you know a therapist for example so
 
03:14:31.429 --> 03:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
um if it's not you know exactly a police
 
03:14:32.990 --> 03:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
report or restraining order there are
 
03:14:37.309 --> 03:14:37.319 align:start position:0%
other forms of self attestation but yeah
 
03:14:39.849 --> 03:14:39.859 align:start position:0%
we come from the perspective of yeah
 
03:14:42.410 --> 03:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Smith
 
03:14:44.150 --> 03:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you do you think it would be
 
03:14:46.670 --> 03:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
possible before the end of the week for
 
03:14:49.190 --> 03:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
you to provide this committee with
 
03:14:51.950 --> 03:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
specific language
 
03:14:56.269 --> 03:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
um that you will believe would put this
 
03:15:00.590 --> 03:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
legislation in line uh in such a ways to
 
03:15:02.510 --> 03:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
answer your concerns
 
03:15:04.550 --> 03:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
I believe that we could do that and we
 
03:15:07.849 --> 03:15:07.859 align:start position:0%
are able to submit some documentation
 
03:15:09.969 --> 03:15:09.979 align:start position:0%
just around vawa and also with the soft
 
03:15:13.010 --> 03:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
attestation of vowel looks like just so
 
03:15:15.230 --> 03:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
that we can thank you instructure other
 
03:15:17.990 --> 03:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness I I I'm sorry
 
03:15:20.929 --> 03:15:20.939 align:start position:0%
did I no so I do have a couple of
 
03:15:20.939 --> 03:15:22.309 align:start position:0%
did I no so I do have a couple of
questions

03:15:22.309 --> 03:15:22.319 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:15:25.309 --> 03:15:25.319 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you could you tell us
 
03:15:28.670 --> 03:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
anything about
 
03:15:28.680 --> 03:15:29.690 align:start position:0%
anything about
um

03:15:29.690 --> 03:15:29.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:33.230 --> 03:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
your knowledge of it strikes me I could
 
03:15:34.670 --> 03:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
be wrong but but it strikes me
 
03:15:36.590 --> 03:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
particularly giving
 
03:15:40.849 --> 03:15:40.859 align:start position:0%
the housing situation right now where a
 
03:15:42.950 --> 03:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
landlord is not going to have any
 
03:15:44.690 --> 03:15:44.700 align:start position:0%
trouble finding a new tenant because
 
03:15:46.550 --> 03:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
there's such a
 
03:15:49.130 --> 03:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
can you give me some
 
03:15:52.130 --> 03:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
some indication of how often does it
 
03:15:55.730 --> 03:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
happen that a tenant wants to break a
 
03:15:57.590 --> 03:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
lease for domestic violence and the
 
03:16:00.590 --> 03:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
landlord says no
 
03:16:04.690 --> 03:16:04.700 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think it it's something that
 
03:16:07.790 --> 03:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
the state currently does have the um
 
03:16:09.349 --> 03:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
those protections that you know once
 
03:16:11.210 --> 03:16:11.220 align:start position:0%
provided a restraining order
 
03:16:12.170 --> 03:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that I can provide
 
03:16:14.630 --> 03:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
specific statistics on like the for the
 
03:16:16.250 --> 03:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
survivors that may not be able to
 
03:16:18.469 --> 03:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
provide that proof but I will say that
 
03:16:21.170 --> 03:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
we work with thousands of survivors a
 
03:16:23.990 --> 03:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
year that are needing to move and break
 
03:16:25.550 --> 03:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
leases and we're needing to navigate
 
03:16:25.560 --> 03:16:27.170 align:start position:0%
leases and we're needing to navigate
that

03:16:27.170 --> 03:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
um right but you know what I just want
 
03:16:30.170 --> 03:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
to make sure I'm understanding are are
 
03:16:31.910 --> 03:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
you saying
 
03:16:36.469 --> 03:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
um that even with private housing there
 
03:16:39.290 --> 03:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
is something in the law now that says if
 
03:16:42.830 --> 03:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
you provide some proof of domestic
 
03:16:46.010 --> 03:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
violence you can break your lease I from
 
03:16:47.870 --> 03:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding I believe it needs to
 
03:16:50.150 --> 03:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
to be a protective order or a police
 
03:16:52.070 --> 03:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
report of something but does that apply
 
03:16:54.950 --> 03:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
to private housing if you have a
 
03:16:57.230 --> 03:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
protective order you that you can break
 
03:17:01.910 --> 03:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:04.490 --> 03:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
um right now I believe that with a with
 
03:17:06.230 --> 03:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
a restraining order or police report
 
03:17:08.570 --> 03:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
provided to the landlord right now in
 
03:17:10.910 --> 03:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
private housing that's that's the case
 
03:17:14.330 --> 03:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
but yeah I know in statute there is a
 
03:17:16.309 --> 03:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
provision around evictions specifically
 
03:17:18.110 --> 03:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
in domestic violence sexual assault or
 
03:17:20.090 --> 03:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
stalking but we can definitely Circle
 
03:17:21.650 --> 03:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
back with the committee to make sure
 
03:17:25.190 --> 03:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
that any new uh Provisions would be in
 
03:17:27.650 --> 03:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
line with state law I we believe this is
 
03:17:28.670 --> 03:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
a gap
 
03:17:30.410 --> 03:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
um currently in state law
 
03:17:33.050 --> 03:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
okay because I I mean I have to say I I
 
03:17:35.330 --> 03:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
was not aware of that for private
 
03:17:37.250 --> 03:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
housing and I guess the other question
 
03:17:40.010 --> 03:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
that that raises is
 
03:17:44.630 --> 03:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
you say there's a gap but I'm not if if
 
03:17:47.030 --> 03:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
the law now is that if you're the victim
 
03:17:49.790 --> 03:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence you can break your
 
03:17:52.130 --> 03:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
lease even with private housing then I'm
 
03:17:53.809 --> 03:17:53.819 align:start position:0%
kind of questioning what do we need this
 
03:17:56.750 --> 03:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
for yeah no I think um I apologize for
 
03:17:58.969 --> 03:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
the miscommunication I know in fact that
 
03:18:02.389 --> 03:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
the RSA 540 refers to eviction
 
03:18:04.309 --> 03:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
um protections for domestic violence
 
03:18:07.130 --> 03:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
survivors in eviction cases I do not
 
03:18:09.290 --> 03:18:09.300 align:start position:0%
believe it's currently in statute so we
 
03:18:11.450 --> 03:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
apologize for the confusion around that
 
03:18:13.370 --> 03:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
okay all right and then I just have one
 
03:18:14.870 --> 03:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
one final question the other question
 
03:18:17.690 --> 03:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not clear on or I guess I have a
 
03:18:19.610 --> 03:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
question about is to the extent you're
 
03:18:22.670 --> 03:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
trying to draw an analogy between
 
03:18:25.070 --> 03:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
public at what the law is with regard to
 
03:18:28.429 --> 03:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
public housing and private housing I
 
03:18:28.439 --> 03:18:29.750 align:start position:0%
public housing and private housing I
guess

03:18:29.750 --> 03:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
guess
 
03:18:31.790 --> 03:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
I have a question about whether that
 
03:18:33.710 --> 03:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
analogy really sort of should hold
 
03:18:37.010 --> 03:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
because if it's one thing to say
 
03:18:40.370 --> 03:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
the public as a landlord should bear the
 
03:18:41.809 --> 03:18:41.819 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
03:18:44.269 --> 03:18:44.279 align:start position:0%
of you know someone who has to break a
 
03:18:46.670 --> 03:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
lease because of domestic violence it's
 
03:18:48.710 --> 03:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
another thing to say that a private
 
03:18:50.510 --> 03:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
landlord should have to bear that cost
 
03:18:50.520 --> 03:18:52.190 align:start position:0%
landlord should have to bear that cost
and

03:18:52.190 --> 03:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:18:54.349 --> 03:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
um particularly I mean the landlord
 
03:18:56.389 --> 03:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
presumably is not at fault any more than
 
03:18:59.450 --> 03:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
the victim is at fault so I guess my
 
03:19:02.150 --> 03:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
quest why should why should the landlord
 
03:19:05.090 --> 03:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
bear that risk
 
03:19:07.969 --> 03:19:07.979 align:start position:0%
um and should we have should we provide
 
03:19:10.309 --> 03:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
some Public Funding for that when the
 
03:19:13.070 --> 03:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
landlord has to uh lose money because of
 
03:19:15.590 --> 03:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
breaking of a lease being broken
 
03:19:18.530 --> 03:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
the we all should pay for it as opposed
 
03:19:20.030 --> 03:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
to just the landlord
 
03:19:21.889 --> 03:19:21.899 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for that question and
 
03:19:23.929 --> 03:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
I think that's a really um good thing
 
03:19:26.330 --> 03:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
good question to unpack our position is
 
03:19:29.330 --> 03:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
just that that the policy be standard
 
03:19:31.309 --> 03:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
across so that survivors regardless of
 
03:19:33.590 --> 03:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
their situation have the same rights
 
03:19:35.030 --> 03:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
afforded to them
 
03:19:37.130 --> 03:19:37.140 align:start position:0%
um but we can we'd be more than happy to
 
03:19:40.610 --> 03:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
discuss um that exact issue
 
03:19:42.290 --> 03:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
um so thank you thank you other
 
03:19:44.389 --> 03:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
03:19:46.309 --> 03:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you thank you
 
03:19:47.929 --> 03:19:47.939 align:start position:0%
both very much
 
03:19:54.590 --> 03:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:56.630 --> 03:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:19:58.849 --> 03:19:58.859 align:start position:0%
thank you again for letting for
 
03:20:01.309 --> 03:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
providing me the opportunity to speak I
 
03:20:02.990 --> 03:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
will attempt to be brief I know our time
 
03:20:04.070 --> 03:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
is short
 
03:20:06.170 --> 03:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
my David Klein already mentioned several
 
03:20:09.530 --> 03:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
things that are our concerns
 
03:20:11.570 --> 03:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
I want to point out that there's two
 
03:20:15.469 --> 03:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
sections in this bill one is for victims
 
03:20:17.690 --> 03:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
of domestic abuse and stalking and
 
03:20:20.150 --> 03:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
violence and so forth and the other one
 
03:20:23.090 --> 03:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
is disabling illnesses or accidents and
 
03:20:25.010 --> 03:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
the provisions in those two sections are
 
03:20:25.020 --> 03:20:26.030 align:start position:0%
the provisions in those two sections are
different

03:20:26.030 --> 03:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:20:28.309 --> 03:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
if you notice that in the disabling
 
03:20:31.610 --> 03:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
illness or accident section a tenant
 
03:20:34.790 --> 03:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
could give as little as one day's notice
 
03:20:37.610 --> 03:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
and and satisfy the con the condition
 
03:20:40.269 --> 03:20:40.279 align:start position:0%
there uh we think that's you know
 
03:20:42.469 --> 03:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
completely unreasonable
 
03:20:45.769 --> 03:20:45.779 align:start position:0%
and I agree exactly with you Mr chairman
 
03:20:48.469 --> 03:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
that we don't see why it is that the
 
03:20:51.590 --> 03:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
landlord should pay the the cost for
 
03:20:51.600 --> 03:20:53.090 align:start position:0%
landlord should pay the the cost for
providing

03:20:53.090 --> 03:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
providing
 
03:20:56.750 --> 03:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
you know for for this situation and if
 
03:20:59.150 --> 03:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
there is a cost we do think that there
 
03:21:00.889 --> 03:21:00.899 align:start position:0%
should be some kind of Public Funding to
 
03:21:03.110 --> 03:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
support that
 
03:21:03.120 --> 03:21:04.010 align:start position:0%
support that
um

03:21:04.010 --> 03:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:07.550 --> 03:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
we are very sympathetic to victims of
 
03:21:09.469 --> 03:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and stalking and all
 
03:21:11.990 --> 03:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
these other situations I just don't feel
 
03:21:14.510 --> 03:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
like it should fall necessarily on the
 
03:21:16.969 --> 03:21:16.979 align:start position:0%
landlord to pay the the costs
 
03:21:19.370 --> 03:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
there are certain costs that a property
 
03:21:22.910 --> 03:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
owner inquire and incurs like paying for
 
03:21:25.250 --> 03:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
a management fee to place a tenant
 
03:21:27.769 --> 03:21:27.779 align:start position:0%
turnover cost to get the apartment ready
 
03:21:29.809 --> 03:21:29.819 align:start position:0%
and those need to be advertised over a
 
03:21:29.819 --> 03:21:32.389 align:start position:0%
and those need to be advertised over a
year

03:21:32.389 --> 03:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:34.790 --> 03:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
at least we should be saying that the
 
03:21:36.590 --> 03:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
tenant should be required to cover the
 
03:21:38.870 --> 03:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
vacancy or if the tenant can't cover the
 
03:21:41.290 --> 03:21:41.300 align:start position:0%
vacancy then have the public
 
03:21:45.469 --> 03:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
housing or city or or some other agency
 
03:21:47.690 --> 03:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
cover that
 
03:21:51.530 --> 03:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
there's the tremendous
 
03:21:54.590 --> 03:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
ambiguity about what's enjoyable
 
03:21:56.809 --> 03:21:56.819 align:start position:0%
I think that's
 
03:21:56.819 --> 03:21:57.769 align:start position:0%
I think that's
yeah

03:21:57.769 --> 03:21:57.779 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:22:00.469 --> 03:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
how can you have something like that in
 
03:22:04.250 --> 03:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
the law I do absolutely believe that we
 
03:22:06.349 --> 03:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
have to be very careful that we don't
 
03:22:08.090 --> 03:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
put into law
 
03:22:10.910 --> 03:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
situations that give tenants rights to
 
03:22:13.070 --> 03:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
abuse the situation
 
03:22:16.910 --> 03:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
and you will see unquestionably tenants
 
03:22:20.269 --> 03:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
take the law and abuse it for their own
 
03:22:22.849 --> 03:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
purpose I think that was asked over here
 
03:22:25.250 --> 03:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
we definitely see that so I wouldn't
 
03:22:28.370 --> 03:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
want to set up a system that so lacks
 
03:22:31.429 --> 03:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
the tenant just hands in a document to
 
03:22:33.710 --> 03:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
the the landlord and then their leases
 
03:22:38.570 --> 03:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:41.750 --> 03:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know right now if someone wants to
 
03:22:44.510 --> 03:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
break their lease for any reason they
 
03:22:46.550 --> 03:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
can just leave
 
03:22:48.830 --> 03:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
they leave there's nothing really a
 
03:22:51.830 --> 03:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
landlord can do about that
 
03:22:55.190 --> 03:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
in fact if they leave then there is a
 
03:22:57.230 --> 03:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
small provision for abandonment which
 
03:22:59.389 --> 03:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
maybe they could take the apartment back
 
03:23:01.910 --> 03:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
and re-rent it but small claims and
 
03:23:03.830 --> 03:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
going after a person if they just break
 
03:23:05.330 --> 03:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
their release and leave we call it a
 
03:23:07.190 --> 03:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
midnight move out there's practically no
 
03:23:12.290 --> 03:23:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:12.300 --> 03:23:13.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:23:13.130 --> 03:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:15.650 --> 03:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
so I guess I would oh there's a couple
 
03:23:15.660 --> 03:23:17.330 align:start position:0%
so I guess I would oh there's a couple
questions

03:23:17.330 --> 03:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:23:17.340 --> 03:23:20.510 align:start position:0%
questions
um

03:23:20.510 --> 03:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:22.610 --> 03:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
now I guess what we covered it I'm happy
 
03:23:24.830 --> 03:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
to take any questions any questions for
 
03:23:26.630 --> 03:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
this Witness
 
03:23:28.370 --> 03:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
uh I'm gonna I guess I oh I'm sorry
 
03:23:30.349 --> 03:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo
 
03:23:32.030 --> 03:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:23:36.229 --> 03:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr Norman so um
 
03:23:39.229 --> 03:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
when a tenant abandons an apartment
 
03:23:41.570 --> 03:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you use the security deposit to
 
03:23:43.429 --> 03:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
cover some of the vacancy
 
03:23:45.950 --> 03:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
you can use the security deposit but
 
03:23:49.070 --> 03:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
it's far below the cost
 
03:23:51.110 --> 03:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
when our tenant abandons an apartment
 
03:23:53.389 --> 03:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
you're likely to have turnover costs
 
03:23:55.969 --> 03:23:55.979 align:start position:0%
repainting maybe replacing some flooring
 
03:23:58.570 --> 03:23:58.580 align:start position:0%
freshening the department up
 
03:24:01.790 --> 03:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
you may have to start an eviction
 
03:24:04.130 --> 03:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
on a vacant apartment just to get legal
 
03:24:06.170 --> 03:24:06.180 align:start position:0%
control over it because the state does
 
03:24:08.330 --> 03:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
not give us any method for retaking an
 
03:24:10.610 --> 03:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
apartment that's been abandoned except
 
03:24:12.410 --> 03:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
for this tiny little window of
 
03:24:15.830 --> 03:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
conditions that's fairly hard to meet so
 
03:24:17.750 --> 03:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
very likely you start an eviction so
 
03:24:19.849 --> 03:24:19.859 align:start position:0%
there's the eviction cost that also
 
03:24:22.010 --> 03:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
probably means two months vacancy
 
03:24:25.610 --> 03:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
so it's a large loss that the landlord
 
03:24:27.830 --> 03:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
Bears when a tenant just does a midnight
 
03:24:29.269 --> 03:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
move out
 
03:24:32.090 --> 03:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
thank you representative page thank you
 
03:24:33.410 --> 03:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:24:35.389 --> 03:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
question we heard prior testimony that
 
03:24:37.849 --> 03:24:37.859 align:start position:0%
in situations like that involve domestic
 
03:24:40.190 --> 03:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
abuse or sexual Survivor systems there's
 
03:24:42.710 --> 03:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
there's a cost to the landlord when that
 
03:24:44.330 --> 03:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
situation remains in the building or the
 
03:24:46.309 --> 03:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
or that is that correct that is true
 
03:24:48.050 --> 03:24:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you in fact it's in the interest
 
03:24:50.570 --> 03:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
of the landlord usually to work with
 
03:24:53.510 --> 03:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
that tenant to to find a way to to make
 
03:24:55.729 --> 03:24:55.739 align:start position:0%
it work and that's usually what happens
 
03:24:57.950 --> 03:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
someone says I've got domestic violence
 
03:25:00.110 --> 03:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
situation come on and so the land how
 
03:25:02.809 --> 03:25:02.819 align:start position:0%
can we make this work let's work out a
 
03:25:05.269 --> 03:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
deal you cover the cost let's have you
 
03:25:06.950 --> 03:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
leave we'll start searching for a new
 
03:25:09.830 --> 03:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
tenant you know that would be usually
 
03:25:12.290 --> 03:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
the case there would be I I can't
 
03:25:12.300 --> 03:25:13.490 align:start position:0%
the case there would be I I can't
imagine

03:25:13.490 --> 03:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
any landlord saying no I want you to
 
03:25:19.790 --> 03:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
stay in that violent situation
 
03:25:23.269 --> 03:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:26.630 --> 03:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
other question yes
 
03:25:28.729 --> 03:25:28.739 align:start position:0%
but can I say that
 
03:25:30.769 --> 03:25:30.779 align:start position:0%
um would it
 
03:25:34.010 --> 03:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
do many victims of domestic violence
 
03:25:39.130 --> 03:25:39.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:41.630 --> 03:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
are you asking do they have to leave
 
03:25:41.640 --> 03:25:43.670 align:start position:0%
are you asking do they have to leave
immediately

03:25:43.670 --> 03:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
03:25:46.250 --> 03:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
face that situation where
 
03:25:49.370 --> 03:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
um you've had a person that has been in
 
03:25:51.769 --> 03:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
that situation and they had to meet to
 
03:25:53.870 --> 03:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
leave immediately yes yeah I've been
 
03:25:57.290 --> 03:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
managing for 35 years I've seen a lot
 
03:26:00.050 --> 03:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
03:26:02.750 --> 03:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir
 
03:26:08.150 --> 03:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:11.750 --> 03:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:15.170 --> 03:26:15.180 align:start position:0%
I'm talking one more time oh that's fine
 
03:26:18.530 --> 03:26:18.540 align:start position:0%
um Karen pokorny from Derek and
 
03:26:19.790 --> 03:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
um I hadn't originally planned on
 
03:26:22.070 --> 03:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
speaking on this one but I saw it when I
 
03:26:24.050 --> 03:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
arrived this morning and just felt like
 
03:26:26.450 --> 03:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
it was needed to humanize this a little
 
03:26:28.610 --> 03:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
bit where when you find yourself in a
 
03:26:31.670 --> 03:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
situation where you're in abuse and you
 
03:26:33.710 --> 03:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
finally have The Bravery to say okay I
 
03:26:36.110 --> 03:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
need to get out first that that takes so
 
03:26:38.929 --> 03:26:38.939 align:start position:0%
much bravery to say okay I need to leave
 
03:26:40.610 --> 03:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
because a lot of the time in these
 
03:26:42.710 --> 03:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
situations the person that is being
 
03:26:45.729 --> 03:26:45.739 align:start position:0%
affected there's the psychological
 
03:26:48.530 --> 03:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
manipulation of that no you're worthless
 
03:26:50.269 --> 03:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
no you're you're you can't do it without
 
03:26:52.849 --> 03:26:52.859 align:start position:0%
me no you can't and just understanding
 
03:26:55.370 --> 03:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
that I know you say that landlords of
 
03:26:56.570 --> 03:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
course want to help but there's a
 
03:26:59.330 --> 03:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
difference between the empathy of
 
03:27:01.670 --> 03:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
understanding this person's at their
 
03:27:03.830 --> 03:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
last string they've decided okay it's
 
03:27:05.510 --> 03:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
gone too far I really need to get out
 
03:27:08.389 --> 03:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
right now and having the ability to do
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
so I think it's our responsibility as a
 
03:27:12.769 --> 03:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
state and as a society say we're going
 
03:27:14.750 --> 03:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
to limit the red tape around how they do
 
03:27:17.809 --> 03:27:17.819 align:start position:0%
that and the cost to landlords shouldn't
 
03:27:19.849 --> 03:27:19.859 align:start position:0%
Trump the safety and protection of the
 
03:27:21.710 --> 03:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
people that are being faced with this
 
03:27:23.690 --> 03:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
problem and I I find it kind of
 
03:27:25.969 --> 03:27:25.979 align:start position:0%
laughable that you're saying the The
 
03:27:29.150 --> 03:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
Empty Apartment is more so important
 
03:27:31.130 --> 03:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
than the safety of a woman's life or a
 
03:27:33.650 --> 03:27:33.660 align:start position:0%
man's life or a child's life and I think
 
03:27:36.769 --> 03:27:36.779 align:start position:0%
the limiting the red tape that is needed
 
03:27:38.269 --> 03:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
to be able to get yourself out of that
 
03:27:38.279 --> 03:27:39.469 align:start position:0%
to be able to get yourself out of that
situation

03:27:39.469 --> 03:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
situation
 
03:27:41.330 --> 03:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
I think it's our responsibility to do
 
03:27:42.889 --> 03:27:42.899 align:start position:0%
everything that we can to make that as
 
03:27:45.469 --> 03:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
easy as possible for them I'll keep it
 
03:27:47.809 --> 03:27:47.819 align:start position:0%
short I just wanted to kind of humanize
 
03:27:49.010 --> 03:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
this a little bit these are people's
 
03:27:51.349 --> 03:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
lives and these are people who want it
 
03:27:54.050 --> 03:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
it takes a ton of excuse me
 
03:27:58.130 --> 03:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
um it takes a ton of Bravery to get to
 
03:27:59.450 --> 03:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
the point where you're saying okay I I
 
03:28:02.210 --> 03:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
need to leave and having the state be on
 
03:28:04.910 --> 03:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
your side in that I think is vital and
 
03:28:06.710 --> 03:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
not having to worry oh I'm going to have
 
03:28:08.570 --> 03:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
an eviction on my notice or I'm going to
 
03:28:11.150 --> 03:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
have this legal cut back if I do decide
 
03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
to leave just having that even on your
 
03:28:14.929 --> 03:28:14.939 align:start position:0%
mind you could be that one step that
 
03:28:16.309 --> 03:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
prevents you from getting yourself out
 
03:28:17.870 --> 03:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
of that situation and your kids out of
 
03:28:20.030 --> 03:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
that situation so I just hope you keep
 
03:28:21.950 --> 03:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
that in mind and I'm in support of this
 
03:28:24.229 --> 03:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
03:28:27.769 --> 03:28:27.779 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir thank you uh uh
 
03:28:37.330 --> 03:28:37.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:39.650 --> 03:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
uh yes my name is Brandon Lemay from
 
03:28:41.389 --> 03:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire representing
 
03:28:44.210 --> 03:28:44.220 align:start position:0%
myself uh and I'm just here speaking in
 
03:28:46.670 --> 03:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
favor of House Bill 261. I'm going to be
 
03:28:48.110 --> 03:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
really brief I think a lot of others
 
03:28:49.490 --> 03:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
have already gone over a lot of great
 
03:28:51.729 --> 03:28:51.739 align:start position:0%
points particularly from the Coalition
 
03:28:53.870 --> 03:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
so I just want to reiterate what they
 
03:28:56.809 --> 03:28:56.819 align:start position:0%
said or just kind of um acknowledge that
 
03:28:58.670 --> 03:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
you know the concerns that they have are
 
03:29:02.090 --> 03:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
very similar concerns as to what I have
 
03:29:03.889 --> 03:29:03.899 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to point out two quick
 
03:29:06.830 --> 03:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
things one is that when we're talking
 
03:29:06.840 --> 03:29:08.690 align:start position:0%
things one is that when we're talking
about

03:29:08.690 --> 03:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:29:10.610 --> 03:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
um what I like to call Ma and PAW
 
03:29:12.950 --> 03:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
landlords I feel like the landlords that
 
03:29:15.590 --> 03:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
we've heard speak today are the type
 
03:29:17.750 --> 03:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
that you know look their tenants in the
 
03:29:19.729 --> 03:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
eyes and have real conversations with
 
03:29:22.250 --> 03:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
people but I also want to mind that we
 
03:29:23.870 --> 03:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
have an increasing number of corporate
 
03:29:26.210 --> 03:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
landlords that are very much by the book
 
03:29:28.910 --> 03:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
and are not able to really give much
 
03:29:31.610 --> 03:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
leeway when it comes to things like this
 
03:29:32.630 --> 03:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to want to follow the
 
03:29:33.650 --> 03:29:33.660 align:start position:0%
lease they're going to want to follow
 
03:29:35.389 --> 03:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
the law they're are not going to want to
 
03:29:37.849 --> 03:29:37.859 align:start position:0%
make many exceptions so I just kind of
 
03:29:39.110 --> 03:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize that like somebody
 
03:29:41.750 --> 03:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
renting from again a big Corporation
 
03:29:44.750 --> 03:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
I've rented from a place like Colonial
 
03:29:46.910 --> 03:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
Village and there's just not a lot of
 
03:29:48.650 --> 03:29:48.660 align:start position:0%
leeway that you can do when it comes to
 
03:29:51.110 --> 03:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
smaller landlords
 
03:29:52.910 --> 03:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
um the second point I want to make two I
 
03:29:54.830 --> 03:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
just really want to emphasize the
 
03:29:57.370 --> 03:29:57.380 align:start position:0%
following disability illness or accident
 
03:30:00.469 --> 03:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
I feel like that's really important we
 
03:30:03.410 --> 03:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
are all at risk of becoming disabled if
 
03:30:06.590 --> 03:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
we're not already either through birth I
 
03:30:09.010 --> 03:30:09.020 align:start position:0%
believe it's birth accident or age
 
03:30:11.690 --> 03:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
so I've particularly worked with a
 
03:30:14.269 --> 03:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
tenant who had a stroke
 
03:30:17.030 --> 03:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago and he was on a third
 
03:30:19.070 --> 03:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
floor walk-up and a walk-up just means
 
03:30:20.389 --> 03:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
there's no elevator
 
03:30:22.670 --> 03:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
and it was really difficult for him to
 
03:30:25.550 --> 03:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
be able to navigate his situation there
 
03:30:27.349 --> 03:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
he was told that the fire department
 
03:30:29.389 --> 03:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
could pick him up three flights of
 
03:30:31.490 --> 03:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
stairs every time he wants to go back
 
03:30:33.410 --> 03:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
into his house
 
03:30:35.450 --> 03:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
um and thankfully after a little bit
 
03:30:37.309 --> 03:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
more stress than what was necessary he
 
03:30:38.389 --> 03:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
was able to work something out this
 
03:30:40.490 --> 03:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
landlord but again if he was renting
 
03:30:42.349 --> 03:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
from a corporate landlord they might not
 
03:30:44.389 --> 03:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
have been able to give the exception
 
03:30:46.610 --> 03:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
that he needs in order to get out of
 
03:30:48.889 --> 03:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
that lease thankfully he had a good
 
03:30:51.710 --> 03:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
landlord but I like to think of tenants
 
03:30:54.229 --> 03:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
who may not have you know
 
03:30:56.570 --> 03:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
I think you know compassionate people as
 
03:30:59.570 --> 03:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
landlords or people actually
 
03:31:01.790 --> 03:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
so I'll keep that short um and I'll open
 
03:31:03.469 --> 03:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
up to any questions
 
03:31:05.690 --> 03:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
for this Witness
 
03:31:07.910 --> 03:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir thank you uh
 
03:31:12.229 --> 03:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:16.250 --> 03:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
or Newark Newark I guess sorry
 
03:31:18.790 --> 03:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative Jody Newell actually
 
03:31:21.110 --> 03:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
I need to improve my handwriting we'll
 
03:31:22.309 --> 03:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
put it that way
 
03:31:24.229 --> 03:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
um I think I'm last I like going last
 
03:31:26.150 --> 03:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
because everyone else uh I got to cross
 
03:31:28.790 --> 03:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
off my entire checklist of points that I
 
03:31:30.170 --> 03:31:30.180 align:start position:0%
wanted to make so I'll keep it very very
 
03:31:33.650 --> 03:31:33.660 align:start position:0%
brief I just want to Echo the difficulty
 
03:31:37.250 --> 03:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
and the importance of reducing barriers
 
03:31:39.229 --> 03:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
excuse me reducing barriers for people
 
03:31:41.630 --> 03:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
leaving domestic violence situations and
 
03:31:45.050 --> 03:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
how easy someone can fall into a
 
03:31:47.030 --> 03:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
financial tailspin I work at a
 
03:31:49.910 --> 03:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
transitional housing shelter and there
 
03:31:51.110 --> 03:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
are a lot of people who come in there
 
03:31:52.550 --> 03:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
who are dealing with domestic violence
 
03:31:55.309 --> 03:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
situations and people who have become
 
03:31:58.309 --> 03:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
handicapped and can no longer work so I
 
03:31:59.750 --> 03:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
I just think it's it's important to
 
03:32:01.910 --> 03:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
remember that on a human level people
 
03:32:05.389 --> 03:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
fall into this very quickly and as much
 
03:32:08.030 --> 03:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
as we can do to reduce barriers to
 
03:32:09.769 --> 03:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
people being able to make that move when
 
03:32:12.110 --> 03:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
they need to as soon as they need to I
 
03:32:14.809 --> 03:32:14.819 align:start position:0%
think it's really important and I Echo
 
03:32:16.370 --> 03:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
everyone else before me
 
03:32:17.809 --> 03:32:17.819 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much questions
 
03:32:20.030 --> 03:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
for this Witness
 
03:32:22.910 --> 03:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
03:32:25.370 --> 03:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who desires to
 
03:32:29.210 --> 03:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 261.
 
03:32:30.830 --> 03:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
 
03:32:33.590 --> 03:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
hearing on that bill and um we're going
 
03:32:36.590 --> 03:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
to the next bill up is 283 which is
 
03:32:39.110 --> 03:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
scheduled for one o'clock I'm gonna in

order to give members of the committee
 
03:32:42.769 --> 03:32:42.779 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to get some lunch I'm
 
03:32:46.190 --> 03:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
going to uh uh res I'm going to postpone
 
03:32:50.630 --> 03:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
that hearing until 1 15 uh pm and that
 
03:32:52.370 --> 03:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
should give everybody at least at least
 
03:32:53.990 --> 03:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
some some reasonable time to get
 
03:32:56.389 --> 03:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
launched uh thank you all very much
 
04:17:51.650 --> 04:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:52.910 --> 04:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:17:56.389 --> 04:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
um it's uh one
 
04:17:58.969 --> 04:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
it's 1 17. I said we're going to start
 
04:18:02.809 --> 04:18:02.819 align:start position:0%
at 1 15 so we're going to start
 
04:18:04.490 --> 04:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the public hearing on
 
04:18:08.510 --> 04:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 283 and represent recognize
 
04:18:11.330 --> 04:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
representative uh Reed the prime sponsor
 
04:18:18.710 --> 04:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:20.750 --> 04:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
04:18:22.969 --> 04:18:22.979 align:start position:0%
welcome Mr chair and honorable members
 
04:18:27.530 --> 04:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
for 75 through my bills for today anyway
 
04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
um so this is a super simple uh Bill the
 
04:18:33.950 --> 04:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh there was a bill last year that was
 
04:18:36.290 --> 04:18:36.300 align:start position:0%
more complex and
 
04:18:40.910 --> 04:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
um objectionable but this simply limits
 
04:18:42.650 --> 04:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
and there's an extra piece that I will
 
04:18:44.870 --> 04:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
speak to but this limits the application
 
04:18:47.870 --> 04:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
fees that landlords charge for
 
04:18:51.530 --> 04:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
prospective tenants to 35 or the cost of
 
04:18:52.910 --> 04:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
running the background check whichever
 
04:18:54.950 --> 04:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
is less
 
04:18:57.229 --> 04:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
um 15 at least 15. I think there might
 
04:18:59.450 --> 04:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
be more now other states have passed
 
04:19:04.550 --> 04:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
similar uh similar laws ranging from
 
04:19:09.229 --> 04:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
like 10 or 25 dollars to like 55 dollars
 
04:19:11.809 --> 04:19:11.819 align:start position:0%
so 35 was really a good in between
 
04:19:13.309 --> 04:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
there's some states that don't that
 
04:19:15.610 --> 04:19:15.620 align:start position:0%
absolutely prohibit
 
04:19:17.990 --> 04:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
application fees the reason that this is
 
04:19:19.849 --> 04:19:19.859 align:start position:0%
a problem now
 
04:19:22.429 --> 04:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
is because of the situation the housing
 
04:19:25.389 --> 04:19:25.399 align:start position:0%
crisis once again there's really
 
04:19:29.929 --> 04:19:29.939 align:start position:0%
no uh real reason that someone even has
 
04:19:31.729 --> 04:19:31.739 align:start position:0%
to rent out their property at this point
 
04:19:34.370 --> 04:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
because there are credit or not credit
 
04:19:36.590 --> 04:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
but application fees that are going into
 
04:19:38.570 --> 04:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
the hundreds of dollars and if you have
 
04:19:40.429 --> 04:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
some pretty pictures of a property up
 
04:19:43.250 --> 04:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
online you can just sit back and take in
 
04:19:46.490 --> 04:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
those application fees and be happy as a
 
04:19:48.050 --> 04:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
clan without ever having to worry about
 
04:19:50.090 --> 04:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
a tenant or anything else in fact
 
04:19:52.250 --> 04:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
there's anecdotal stories of this very
 
04:19:55.070 --> 04:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
thing happening so really simple just
 
04:19:56.929 --> 04:19:56.939 align:start position:0%
limited at 35 are the cost of the
 
04:19:58.309 --> 04:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
background check a lot of other states
 
04:20:00.830 --> 04:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
have have limited to it to cost as well
 
04:20:03.349 --> 04:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
so I just did an either or situation
 
04:20:05.210 --> 04:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
to kind of kind of get right in the
 
04:20:06.849 --> 04:20:06.859 align:start position:0%
middle of what other states are doing
 
04:20:10.809 --> 04:20:10.819 align:start position:0%
then there was a last minute Edition
 
04:20:13.429 --> 04:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
because I and I think we'll have
 
04:20:15.530 --> 04:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
testimony speaking to this but I became
 
04:20:18.229 --> 04:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
aware of a phenomenon that's been
 
04:20:20.450 --> 04:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
happening recently
 
04:20:23.389 --> 04:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
um of holding fees so holding fees are
 
04:20:25.849 --> 04:20:25.859 align:start position:0%
in addition to the application fee and
 
04:20:29.210 --> 04:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
can be from what I understand north of
 
04:20:32.389 --> 04:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
even a thousand dollars and talk about
 
04:20:34.309 --> 04:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
not having to rent out your property at
 
04:20:38.150 --> 04:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
all so the holding fees are not only
 
04:20:41.570 --> 04:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
exorbitant and increasingly so but also
 
04:20:45.170 --> 04:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
um not refundable so what I said is that
 
04:20:47.330 --> 04:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
any additional fee so you know whether
 
04:20:48.530 --> 04:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
you call it holding fee or whatever
 
04:20:50.870 --> 04:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
other fee you might call it any
 
04:20:53.030 --> 04:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
additional fee is capped at 250 and has
 
04:20:54.650 --> 04:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
to be refundable but the actual
 
04:20:57.349 --> 04:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
application fee is not refundable that's
 
04:20:59.150 --> 04:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
a major difference between my bill and
 
04:21:01.250 --> 04:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
the previous bill
 
04:21:04.490 --> 04:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
um having said that short simple sweet
 
04:21:07.389 --> 04:21:07.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take questions
 
04:21:09.950 --> 04:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
for this week representative Alexander
 
04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:21:14.090 --> 04:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
representative I'm looking at so I know
 
04:21:15.950 --> 04:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
the 35 or cost of conducting a
 
04:21:17.330 --> 04:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
background check does the background
 
04:21:19.729 --> 04:21:19.739 align:start position:0%
check have to be conducted at all or
 
04:21:22.490 --> 04:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
would you just so so with that in mind
 
04:21:24.410 --> 04:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
could you just you know have 20 people
 
04:21:27.229 --> 04:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
you know I'm thinking 20 times 35 that's
 
04:21:30.050 --> 04:21:30.060 align:start position:0%
700 a month that wouldn't necessarily
 
04:21:32.929 --> 04:21:32.939 align:start position:0%
solve the problem of there's nowhere
 
04:21:35.090 --> 04:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
going for 700 at least not my neck of
 
04:21:37.969 --> 04:21:37.979 align:start position:0%
woods you would be hard-pressed to find
 
04:21:40.010 --> 04:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
a place going for twice that right now
 
04:21:44.929 --> 04:21:44.939 align:start position:0%
so um so yeah 35 is is pretty reasonable
 
04:21:47.990 --> 04:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
but I mean pretty safe to prevent that
 
04:21:51.290 --> 04:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
problem that I was describing but 250 is
 
04:21:54.170 --> 04:21:54.180 align:start position:0%
not so if you had 10 people apply a
 
04:21:56.809 --> 04:21:56.819 align:start position:0%
month for your place you would have
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
twenty five hundred dollars a month and
 
04:22:01.010 --> 04:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
never have to do a single thing
 
04:22:04.969 --> 04:22:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:07.330 --> 04:22:07.340 align:start position:0%
oh this was the easy way
 
04:22:10.809 --> 04:22:10.819 align:start position:0%
it's so close very close
 
04:22:14.450 --> 04:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
my only question was this in the um
 
04:22:18.349 --> 04:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
in the scenario you you sort of posited
 
04:22:22.550 --> 04:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
about a landlord who decides to
 
04:22:23.929 --> 04:22:23.939 align:start position:0%
that they don't really care about
 
04:22:25.370 --> 04:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
running the property they're just going
 
04:22:26.929 --> 04:22:26.939 align:start position:0%
to sort of
 
04:22:28.910 --> 04:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
you know propose like they want to rent
 
04:22:31.729 --> 04:22:31.739 align:start position:0%
it and then collect all these fees if if
 
04:22:34.729 --> 04:22:34.739 align:start position:0%
if so if a landlord were actually to do
 
04:22:37.490 --> 04:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
that couldn't they be sued for fraud
 
04:22:40.130 --> 04:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
that you that you've you've had you've
 
04:22:41.990 --> 04:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
said you want to rent this property but
 
04:22:45.290 --> 04:22:45.300 align:start position:0%
you really don't oh I I imagine that
 
04:22:48.050 --> 04:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
they could be sued for fraud but I mean
 
04:22:50.030 --> 04:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
again you have to realize that those
 
04:22:52.490 --> 04:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
types of legal recourses are available
 
04:22:54.590 --> 04:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
to people who usually aren't renting
 
04:22:56.269 --> 04:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
anyway they're homeowners that never
 
04:22:57.889 --> 04:22:57.899 align:start position:0%
encounter this sort of thing if you're
 
04:22:59.750 --> 04:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
in the rental market if you're trying to
 
04:23:02.150 --> 04:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
find housing by renting first of all
 
04:23:04.070 --> 04:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of bandwidth that you're
 
04:23:05.510 --> 04:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
already expending you're not looking
 
04:23:07.370 --> 04:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
into secondly how would you ever know
 
04:23:09.110 --> 04:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
that they didn't rent it out like you're
 
04:23:10.969 --> 04:23:10.979 align:start position:0%
not continuing to pursue that place
 
04:23:13.010 --> 04:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
you're you're actively looking for a
 
04:23:14.929 --> 04:23:14.939 align:start position:0%
place to live and if you're not getting
 
04:23:16.610 --> 04:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
accepted there you're looking elsewhere
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
and once you get a place to live you're
 
04:23:19.849 --> 04:23:19.859 align:start position:0%
no longer looking anymore so you'd be
 
04:23:21.889 --> 04:23:21.899 align:start position:0%
very unlikely to be able to prove that
 
04:23:24.650 --> 04:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
they intentionally were you know not
 
04:23:26.570 --> 04:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
rinsing the place out and then thirdly
 
04:23:28.490 --> 04:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
then you'd have to go get and hire a
 
04:23:30.830 --> 04:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
lawyer and then you'd have to prove some
 
04:23:32.510 --> 04:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
sort of standing of like well how did
 
04:23:34.010 --> 04:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
this actually hurt you just because you
 
04:23:36.830 --> 04:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
didn't get this place so I it would be
 
04:23:39.769 --> 04:23:39.779 align:start position:0%
it is I would say a fairly safe practice
 
04:23:42.110 --> 04:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
although probably illegal or maybe
 
04:23:45.349 --> 04:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
illegal or maybe subjected to criminal
 
04:23:48.590 --> 04:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
or sorry civil action it's still pretty
 
04:23:50.090 --> 04:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
safe for landlords to be able to get
 
04:23:52.189 --> 04:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
away with something like that
 
04:23:54.110 --> 04:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
other questions for this representative
 
04:23:54.120 --> 04:23:55.189 align:start position:0%
other questions for this representative
Perez

04:23:55.189 --> 04:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
Perez
 
04:23:56.689 --> 04:23:56.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:23:59.689 --> 04:23:59.699 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea what the fees that
 
04:24:03.590 --> 04:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
the actual landlord would incur if he
 
04:24:05.150 --> 04:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
was um
 
04:24:08.870 --> 04:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
if you had people say we have we have a
 
04:24:12.530 --> 04:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
management company so if I'm a landlord
 
04:24:15.290 --> 04:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
with management company what are the
 
04:24:18.110 --> 04:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
fees that they would incur I mean 35
 
04:24:20.389 --> 04:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
dollars I mean I just had a background
 
04:24:22.370 --> 04:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
check for Second Amendment stuff and it
 
04:24:23.870 --> 04:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
was forty three dollars for the
 
04:24:26.150 --> 04:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
background check so that could be
 
04:24:28.490 --> 04:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
separate and then I had to fill out some
 
04:24:30.710 --> 04:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
paperwork that was additional money so
 
04:24:33.309 --> 04:24:33.319 align:start position:0%
do we know what how much the landlord
 
04:24:36.050 --> 04:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
landlords are paying each time someone
 
04:24:38.689 --> 04:24:38.699 align:start position:0%
applies for an apartment so I'm not sure
 
04:24:41.210 --> 04:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
about the kinds of like maybe federal
 
04:24:43.610 --> 04:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
level or multi-level background checks
 
04:24:47.990 --> 04:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
that maybe gun stores might require
 
04:24:50.389 --> 04:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
um but or if they're charging an
 
04:24:52.010 --> 04:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
additional administrative fee if they're
 
04:24:55.969 --> 04:24:55.979 align:start position:0%
charging that fee on to you but uh in
 
04:24:58.849 --> 04:24:58.859 align:start position:0%
general anyone can kind of use a number
 
04:25:00.710 --> 04:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
of online services and they usually
 
04:25:03.830 --> 04:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
range between 10 and 15 online in my
 
04:25:03.840 --> 04:25:04.969 align:start position:0%
range between 10 and 15 online in my
experience

04:25:04.969 --> 04:25:04.979 align:start position:0%
experience
 
04:25:06.889 --> 04:25:06.899 align:start position:0%
um however people who are in the
 
04:25:08.269 --> 04:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
business of having to run frequent
 
04:25:09.830 --> 04:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
background checks usually have a
 
04:25:11.809 --> 04:25:11.819 align:start position:0%
subscription to a service which makes it
 
04:25:17.990 --> 04:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:22.309 --> 04:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:22.319 --> 04:25:23.210 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:25:23.210 --> 04:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:25:25.370 --> 04:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
yes representative stapled
 
04:25:26.929 --> 04:25:26.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:25:28.490 --> 04:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:25:30.229 --> 04:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
that's quite something
 
04:25:32.030 --> 04:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
um that you mentioned a new phenomenon
 
04:25:33.769 --> 04:25:33.779 align:start position:0%
of holding fees
 
04:25:36.830 --> 04:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
I suppose there could be option fees the
 
04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
phenomenon of fees today is they pop up
 
04:25:42.710 --> 04:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
with all kinds of nice names and I see
 
04:25:45.590 --> 04:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
from your text to your bill you say any
 
04:25:47.809 --> 04:25:47.819 align:start position:0%
other fee charged by the landlord as
 
04:25:49.550 --> 04:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
part of the rental application process
 
04:25:51.170 --> 04:25:51.180 align:start position:0%
shall be refundable
 
04:25:54.729 --> 04:25:54.739 align:start position:0%
so any other fees could be anything
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
fee nature other than security deposit
 
04:26:00.710 --> 04:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
or first month's rent or so is that
 
04:26:00.720 --> 04:26:02.450 align:start position:0%
or first month's rent or so is that
right

04:26:02.450 --> 04:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:26:04.070 --> 04:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
right I don't know how that got turned
 
04:26:04.080 --> 04:26:05.030 align:start position:0%
right I don't know how that got turned
off

04:26:05.030 --> 04:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
off
 
04:26:07.070 --> 04:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
um so that's the thing is that this
 
04:26:08.990 --> 04:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
whole new phenomenon of holding fees
 
04:26:11.510 --> 04:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
just kind of crept up and or you know it
 
04:26:13.550 --> 04:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
may have existed in some limited form in
 
04:26:16.550 --> 04:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
the past but it's become again was zero
 
04:26:19.550 --> 04:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
percent vacancy all of the power is in
 
04:26:20.990 --> 04:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
the hands of the people who own the
 
04:26:23.090 --> 04:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
property and not the people trying to
 
04:26:25.189 --> 04:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
secure a roof over their head and
 
04:26:27.010 --> 04:26:27.020 align:start position:0%
because of that they're able to kind of
 
04:26:30.349 --> 04:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
take advantage of any number of schemes
 
04:26:33.110 --> 04:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
like a holding fee and charge hundreds
 
04:26:34.670 --> 04:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
and like I said in some instances it
 
04:26:36.830 --> 04:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like over a thousand dollars so
 
04:26:38.929 --> 04:26:38.939 align:start position:0%
the whole point is that yes you can
 
04:26:40.370 --> 04:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
charge an extra fee if there's a
 
04:26:42.769 --> 04:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
reasonable you know reason to need to do
 
04:26:44.990 --> 04:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
that but it needs to be beyond the
 
04:26:46.790 --> 04:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
actual background check and credit check
 
04:26:50.330 --> 04:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
it needs to be refundable so we're not
 
04:26:51.889 --> 04:26:51.899 align:start position:0%
trying to remove anything you know
 
04:26:53.870 --> 04:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
everything and everything from landlords
 
04:26:56.269 --> 04:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
but we we after some discussion we
 
04:26:58.610 --> 04:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
decided that there's really probably no
 
04:27:01.070 --> 04:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
situation where 250 dollars wouldn't
 
04:27:03.290 --> 04:27:03.300 align:start position:0%
cover whatever they might need to have
 
04:27:05.090 --> 04:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
in terms of a holding fear any other fee
 
04:27:06.950 --> 04:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
but yeah the idea is that's any other
 
04:27:09.170 --> 04:27:09.180 align:start position:0%
fee because we understand that they can
 
04:27:11.750 --> 04:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
name things whatever they want to name
 
04:27:14.090 --> 04:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
other ques yes representative
 
04:27:17.030 --> 04:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
yeah uh thanks and and thanks uh
 
04:27:19.010 --> 04:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
representative Reed quick question on
 
04:27:21.170 --> 04:27:21.180 align:start position:0%
the fixed dollar amounts um it just
 
04:27:22.729 --> 04:27:22.739 align:start position:0%
always sort of worries me to have fixed
 
04:27:24.469 --> 04:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts and things that hopefully
 
04:27:26.090 --> 04:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
will stay on the books for a long time
 
04:27:26.100 --> 04:27:27.530 align:start position:0%
will stay on the books for a long time
and

04:27:27.530 --> 04:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:30.050 --> 04:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
um what are your thoughts on that versus
 
04:27:32.510 --> 04:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
like a percentage and and I guess that
 
04:27:34.550 --> 04:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
would also in my mind open the door to
 
04:27:38.870 --> 04:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
if this was a very high dollar you know
 
04:27:41.090 --> 04:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
unit that was being rented could they
 
04:27:43.070 --> 04:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
potentially charge more because maybe
 
04:27:45.950 --> 04:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
there's a higher higher process involved
 
04:27:48.710 --> 04:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
in in vetting so I I guess I'm saying
 
04:27:51.410 --> 04:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
you know percentage versus as fixed
 
04:27:53.809 --> 04:27:53.819 align:start position:0%
dollar amount I mean I'm fine with the
 
04:27:56.450 --> 04:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
percentage if that's what this uh
 
04:27:58.790 --> 04:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
committee would prefer like I said I
 
04:28:01.550 --> 04:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
looked at the 15 states and they're
 
04:28:03.349 --> 04:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
probably more now that had already
 
04:28:04.910 --> 04:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
passed something and this seemed to be
 
04:28:07.550 --> 04:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
right in the middle of the the span of
 
04:28:09.229 --> 04:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
what they were doing some states do do a
 
04:28:10.309 --> 04:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
percentage I would suggest something
 
04:28:12.229 --> 04:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
like five percent in our current housing
 
04:28:14.929 --> 04:28:14.939 align:start position:0%
market that sounds about right
 
04:28:16.550 --> 04:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
um but there are percentages there are
 
04:28:18.769 --> 04:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
some states that ban the application fee
 
04:28:21.889 --> 04:28:21.899 align:start position:0%
altogether there are states that have uh
 
04:28:24.290 --> 04:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
25 their states that have 35 dollars
 
04:28:26.450 --> 04:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
fifty five dollars
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
um and then there are states that just
 
04:28:30.290 --> 04:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
say the cost you cannot charge more than
 
04:28:33.469 --> 04:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
what it costs so I wanted to kind of be
 
04:28:35.210 --> 04:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
in the middle and cover all my bases so
 
04:28:37.729 --> 04:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
that's why because I also hesitate to do
 
04:28:39.590 --> 04:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
fixed dollar amounts or fixed numbers at
 
04:28:41.450 --> 04:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
all in any of my legislation for the
 
04:28:43.429 --> 04:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
very reasons that you suggested I like
 
04:28:46.550 --> 04:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
formulas better so that's why I said or
 
04:28:48.830 --> 04:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
the cost of actually doing the
 
04:28:50.030 --> 04:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
background check
 
04:28:52.130 --> 04:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
other question yes representative
 
04:28:52.140 --> 04:28:53.450 align:start position:0%

04:28:53.450 --> 04:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
Andrews
 
04:28:55.429 --> 04:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:28:58.070 --> 04:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you have a link
 
04:29:00.290 --> 04:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
that you could send the whole committee
 
04:29:02.510 --> 04:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
so that we could look how different
 
04:29:05.450 --> 04:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
states go out I'm very happy to send
 
04:29:07.429 --> 04:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
that along in fact I do think that you
 
04:29:09.410 --> 04:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
already for one of my co-sponsors since
 
04:29:11.570 --> 04:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
along that information to the committee
 
04:29:13.490 --> 04:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
already with the comprehensive list of
 
04:29:15.170 --> 04:29:15.180 align:start position:0%
and there are also a bunch of cities
 
04:29:17.269 --> 04:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
across the country that also do this if
 
04:29:19.610 --> 04:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
home rule states where the cities are
 
04:29:21.229 --> 04:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
allowed to do it
 
04:29:23.210 --> 04:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
um that have already that do similar
 
04:29:25.130 --> 04:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
things but just for those 15 states that
 
04:29:28.010 --> 04:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
I I mentioned that list is already
 
04:29:30.490 --> 04:29:30.500 align:start position:0%
should be in your your testimony already
 
04:29:32.870 --> 04:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
yeah other question representative
 
04:29:32.880 --> 04:29:35.389 align:start position:0%
yeah other question representative
Oregon

04:29:35.389 --> 04:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:38.210 --> 04:29:38.220 align:start position:0%
yes thank you you uh you testified that
 
04:29:40.250 --> 04:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
the actual cost is
 
04:29:42.590 --> 04:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
much less than 35 dollars in most cases
 
04:29:45.050 --> 04:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
and I've seen ads to that effect um but
 
04:29:48.050 --> 04:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
do you feel that perhaps this 35 is
 
04:29:50.210 --> 04:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
actually more than the cost so that
 
04:29:52.250 --> 04:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
should be a regionally inflation proof
 
04:29:54.290 --> 04:29:54.300 align:start position:0%
uh price at least for the next few years
 
04:29:57.170 --> 04:29:57.180 align:start position:0%
obviously if inflation goes well if it's
 
04:29:58.490 --> 04:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
too low then at some point this
 
04:30:01.010 --> 04:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
legislation will have to raise a fee
 
04:30:03.530 --> 04:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
which of course is virtually very very
 
04:30:05.090 --> 04:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
difficult to do but does happen
 
04:30:07.370 --> 04:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
sometimes but but you think in the short
 
04:30:09.050 --> 04:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
run this is a reasonable reasonable
 
04:30:12.830 --> 04:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
amount to a set as the limit indeed I um
 
04:30:18.050 --> 04:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
I do especially not only can you find a
 
04:30:19.969 --> 04:30:19.979 align:start position:0%
number of services right now just by
 
04:30:22.490 --> 04:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
Googling that provide it for a very low
 
04:30:25.570 --> 04:30:25.580 align:start position:0%
cost less much less than 35
 
04:30:30.530 --> 04:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
but uh the the so you could triple that
 
04:30:32.630 --> 04:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
number over inflation and still be
 
04:30:34.790 --> 04:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
capped at that 35 and still have the
 
04:30:36.410 --> 04:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
cost covered
 
04:30:38.750 --> 04:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness I'll
 
04:30:40.849 --> 04:30:40.859 align:start position:0%
just add to that that you know at some
 
04:30:43.189 --> 04:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
point there is a cost of doing business
 
04:30:45.050 --> 04:30:45.060 align:start position:0%
for every industry right there's just
 
04:30:47.929 --> 04:30:47.939 align:start position:0%
costs of doing business and while you
 
04:30:49.429 --> 04:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
find you want to make sure you recoup
 
04:30:50.809 --> 04:30:50.819 align:start position:0%
those costs but sometimes you can't
 
04:30:52.849 --> 04:30:52.859 align:start position:0%
recoup it you know one for one you just
 
04:30:55.729 --> 04:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
have to absorb it in the overall
 
04:31:00.889 --> 04:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:03.229 --> 04:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
04:31:15.649 --> 04:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:15.659 --> 04:31:20.809 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:31:20.809 --> 04:31:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:22.910 --> 04:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
um again I'm just coming at this as a
 
04:31:24.469 --> 04:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
young person that's trying to survive in
 
04:31:27.110 --> 04:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
this state and as someone who's
 
04:31:28.969 --> 04:31:28.979 align:start position:0%
personally gone through trying to find
 
04:31:31.370 --> 04:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
an apartment in the state and and it's
 
04:31:33.590 --> 04:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
nearly impossible guys like it you
 
04:31:35.929 --> 04:31:35.939 align:start position:0%
really for the cost of living that we're
 
04:31:38.030 --> 04:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
at in the amount of savings that you
 
04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
have to do just to get that first month
 
04:31:43.130 --> 04:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
second month security deposit and then
 
04:31:46.610 --> 04:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
if you have to put in for 10 11 15
 
04:31:48.950 --> 04:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
different apartments and the cost to put
 
04:31:51.229 --> 04:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
in these fees are fifty dollars it's
 
04:31:54.170 --> 04:31:54.180 align:start position:0%
just not doable for someone my age like
 
04:31:56.990 --> 04:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
singly trying to find a place we're just
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
not making an attainable for young
 
04:32:00.649 --> 04:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
people to stay in this state and last
 
04:32:02.510 --> 04:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
time I checked you guys were elected by
 
04:32:04.189 --> 04:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
the voters of the state and not the
 
04:32:06.110 --> 04:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
landlords and it seems like you're
 
04:32:08.030 --> 04:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
protecting the landlord's rights more
 
04:32:11.269 --> 04:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
than your constituents and when 50 of
 
04:32:12.649 --> 04:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
the youth are still living at their
 
04:32:14.870 --> 04:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
parents home because they can't afford a
 
04:32:17.030 --> 04:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
place to live and we question why the
 
04:32:19.130 --> 04:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
raising rates of age in the state is
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
going up and up and up where are we
 
04:32:23.090 --> 04:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
going to be in 15 years when we've
 
04:32:25.130 --> 04:32:25.140 align:start position:0%
pushed out every young person that wants
 
04:32:27.950 --> 04:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
to stay in the state I was raised here I
 
04:32:29.870 --> 04:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
love this state more than anything and
 
04:32:31.790 --> 04:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
I've worked my butt off to try to stay
 
04:32:34.910 --> 04:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
here because I do love it but it it's
 
04:32:37.189 --> 04:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
the legislation that we have in now is
 
04:32:39.170 --> 04:32:39.180 align:start position:0%
not protecting people like me it's
 
04:32:40.969 --> 04:32:40.979 align:start position:0%
protecting landlords it's protecting the
 
04:32:42.950 --> 04:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
business it's not protecting your
 
04:32:45.349 --> 04:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
constituents and frankly I'm getting a
 
04:32:47.570 --> 04:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
little tired of it because it just at
 
04:32:49.309 --> 04:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
the cost of living where we're at now
 
04:32:51.290 --> 04:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
with the vacancy rates that we're at now
 
04:32:53.689 --> 04:32:53.699 align:start position:0%
you're not just applying to one place
 
04:32:57.830 --> 04:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's not 150 application fee it's 15 and
 
04:32:59.769 --> 04:32:59.779 align:start position:0%
when you're getting a profit from that
 
04:33:03.410 --> 04:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
it it just doesn't seem fair and for me
 
04:33:06.410 --> 04:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
it feels like what you guys's job is is
 
04:33:08.150 --> 04:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you're protecting your
 
04:33:11.269 --> 04:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
constituents from misuse from
 
04:33:13.490 --> 04:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
corporations and that's not being done
 
04:33:15.529 --> 04:33:15.539 align:start position:0%
right now it seems like your interest is
 
04:33:17.929 --> 04:33:17.939 align:start position:0%
in protecting the landlords and I just
 
04:33:20.029 --> 04:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
really hope that this does pass because
 
04:33:21.650 --> 04:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
I I really do feel like this is
 
04:33:23.330 --> 04:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
something that's really preventing young
 
04:33:25.970 --> 04:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
people from having a fair share a fair
 
04:33:28.670 --> 04:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
shot at finding a place especially with
 
04:33:30.830 --> 04:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
the vacancy rates that they're at now
 
04:33:34.670 --> 04:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
um I mean I live with my mom in my 20 my
 
04:33:37.730 --> 04:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
31 year old sister lives there my 39
 
04:33:39.709 --> 04:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
year old brother lives there because we
 
04:33:42.349 --> 04:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
can't find a place to live and I've been
 
04:33:44.330 --> 04:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
looking for the last two years and over
 
04:33:46.250 --> 04:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
the last two years I put in over 25
 
04:33:49.490 --> 04:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
applications that really does add up and
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
when you're barely keeping your head
 
04:33:53.510 --> 04:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
above water I worked three jobs guys
 
04:33:57.051 --> 04:33:57.061 align:start position:0%
three jobs and I cannot afford a place
 
04:33:58.730 --> 04:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
to live in this state
 
04:34:02.269 --> 04:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
that's not right it's not right so I
 
04:34:04.551 --> 04:34:04.561 align:start position:0%
just honestly I beg of you just we got
 
04:34:05.929 --> 04:34:05.939 align:start position:0%
to put in more legislation that's
 
04:34:07.609 --> 04:34:07.619 align:start position:0%
supporting the working people of the
 
04:34:09.349 --> 04:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
state because right now there's no
 
04:34:12.289 --> 04:34:12.299 align:start position:0%
protections so thank you questions for
 
04:34:14.390 --> 04:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
this Witness
 
04:34:17.150 --> 04:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir uh
 
04:34:32.289 --> 04:34:32.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:34.730 --> 04:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
thank you very much again for an
 
04:34:37.131 --> 04:34:37.141 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
04:34:40.910 --> 04:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
and the landlord community no probably
 
04:34:42.289 --> 04:34:42.299 align:start position:0%
not surprising to you would be against
 
04:34:43.551 --> 04:34:43.561 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:34:45.470 --> 04:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
the testimony that I just handed out
 
04:34:46.970 --> 04:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
looks to me like there is a cut and
 
04:34:48.830 --> 04:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
paste error in there so I just want to
 
04:34:50.689 --> 04:34:50.699 align:start position:0%
highlight that in the second paragraph
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
it starts out saying this bill is
 
04:34:55.730 --> 04:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
clearly a restraint on service right to
 
04:34:57.289 --> 04:34:57.299 align:start position:0%
sell property that's got to be about a
 
04:34:58.490 --> 04:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
different bill I don't know how I ended
 
04:34:59.929 --> 04:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
up in there
 
04:35:04.789 --> 04:35:04.799 align:start position:0%
so the 35 dollars is appears to be an
 
04:35:06.730 --> 04:35:06.740 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number it doesn't reflect
 
04:35:09.051 --> 04:35:09.061 align:start position:0%
necessarily actual cost it could be
 
04:35:11.269 --> 04:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
actual cost in some cases but it
 
04:35:12.949 --> 04:35:12.959 align:start position:0%
certainly would not take into account
 
04:35:15.289 --> 04:35:15.299 align:start position:0%
the amount of time effort
 
04:35:18.410 --> 04:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
spent on processing an application a
 
04:35:20.449 --> 04:35:20.459 align:start position:0%
landlord can easily spend a few hours
 
04:35:22.551 --> 04:35:22.561 align:start position:0%
processing an application
 
04:35:26.269 --> 04:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
and besides the credit report you know
 
04:35:28.010 --> 04:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
the landlord would also get a landlord
 
04:35:29.869 --> 04:35:29.879 align:start position:0%
tenant report some landlords get a
 
04:35:33.670 --> 04:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
criminal report Which is far more money
 
04:35:35.929 --> 04:35:35.939 align:start position:0%
some landlords hire a professional
 
04:35:35.939 --> 04:35:37.150 align:start position:0%
some landlords hire a professional
service

04:35:37.150 --> 04:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:35:40.609 --> 04:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
realtors that might property manage for
 
04:35:44.150 --> 04:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
them and that that cost could be greater
 
04:35:45.890 --> 04:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
there's only a portion of the
 
04:35:48.830 --> 04:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
applications that could get denied
 
04:35:53.209 --> 04:35:53.219 align:start position:0%
so on personally I don't see what you're
 
04:35:55.910 --> 04:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
hearing being testified in terms of this
 
04:35:55.920 --> 04:35:57.349 align:start position:0%
hearing being testified in terms of this
gigantic

04:35:57.349 --> 04:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
gigantic
 
04:35:59.689 --> 04:35:59.699 align:start position:0%
wave of people applying for apartments
 
04:36:02.090 --> 04:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
it's people standing in lines I don't
 
04:36:04.490 --> 04:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
see that in my company at all we manage
 
04:36:07.250 --> 04:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
48 units I do see that the market is
 
04:36:10.369 --> 04:36:10.379 align:start position:0%
strong I do see that
 
04:36:10.379 --> 04:36:11.990 align:start position:0%
strong I do see that
um

04:36:11.990 --> 04:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:13.970 --> 04:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
there's greater demand than there is
 
04:36:13.980 --> 04:36:15.109 align:start position:0%
there's greater demand than there is
Supply

04:36:15.109 --> 04:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
Supply
 
04:36:18.289 --> 04:36:18.299 align:start position:0%
but I would say it's unusual that I have
 
04:36:20.689 --> 04:36:20.699 align:start position:0%
more than one or two people applying for
 
04:36:22.730 --> 04:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
an apartment when we do have someone
 
04:36:24.890 --> 04:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
applying for an apartment we process
 
04:36:27.109 --> 04:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
that application within one day
 
04:36:28.730 --> 04:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
and one of those people gets the
 
04:36:28.740 --> 04:36:29.929 align:start position:0%
and one of those people gets the
apartment

04:36:29.929 --> 04:36:29.939 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
it would be really rare for us to deny
 
04:36:34.080 --> 04:36:34.789 align:start position:0%
it would be really rare for us to deny
um

04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:37.609 --> 04:36:37.619 align:start position:0%
an application or to deny multiple
 
04:36:41.269 --> 04:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
applications unless the tenant is
 
04:36:43.631 --> 04:36:43.641 align:start position:0%
actually falsifying the the application
 
04:36:46.849 --> 04:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
and that does happen it happens quite
 
04:36:46.859 --> 04:36:48.349 align:start position:0%
and that does happen it happens quite
frequently

04:36:48.349 --> 04:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
04:36:51.410 --> 04:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
and so I certainly would not want to put
 
04:36:54.470 --> 04:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
in a law that says the tenant that's
 
04:36:56.869 --> 04:36:56.879 align:start position:0%
falsifying their application
 
04:36:59.029 --> 04:36:59.039 align:start position:0%
once the landlord discovers that then
 
04:37:01.010 --> 04:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
gets their money back
 
04:37:03.051 --> 04:37:03.061 align:start position:0%
and this says additional fees would be
 
04:37:03.061 --> 04:37:04.310 align:start position:0%
and this says additional fees would be
returned

04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
returned
 
04:37:06.109 --> 04:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
and there could be certainly additional
 
04:37:09.709 --> 04:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
fees for discovering all of that um I'm
 
04:37:11.510 --> 04:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
verifying what what's false and what's
 
04:37:11.520 --> 04:37:12.830 align:start position:0%
verifying what what's false and what's
true

04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:37:14.929 --> 04:37:14.939 align:start position:0%
the term background check is very
 
04:37:18.051 --> 04:37:18.061 align:start position:0%
ambiguous we're not sure what that means
 
04:37:20.269 --> 04:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
there's a portion in there that talks
 
04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
about penalties
 
04:37:23.029 --> 04:37:23.039 align:start position:0%
the penalties are completely
 
04:37:25.970 --> 04:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
unreasonable or what we're talking about
 
04:37:28.730 --> 04:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
we're talking about application fees
 
04:37:32.150 --> 04:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
that could range from what I commonly
 
04:37:32.160 --> 04:37:33.529 align:start position:0%
that could range from what I commonly
see

04:37:33.529 --> 04:37:33.539 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:37:35.990 --> 04:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
certainly below fifty dollars
 
04:37:38.810 --> 04:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about penalties of a
 
04:37:41.150 --> 04:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and court costs and
 
04:37:43.670 --> 04:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees it's just totally
 
04:37:43.680 --> 04:37:47.051 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees it's just totally
unreasonable

04:37:47.051 --> 04:37:47.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
I think that covers the bulk of what I
 
04:37:54.890 --> 04:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:56.570 --> 04:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
you know if a tenant is having trouble
 
04:37:59.090 --> 04:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
with losing application fees they can
 
04:38:01.429 --> 04:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
talk to the lender they're applying for
 
04:38:03.529 --> 04:38:03.539 align:start position:0%
and go over their situation find out the
 
04:38:05.150 --> 04:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
landlord's criteria
 
04:38:07.131 --> 04:38:07.141 align:start position:0%
and see if they're a match before they
 
04:38:07.141 --> 04:38:08.269 align:start position:0%
and see if they're a match before they
apply

04:38:08.269 --> 04:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
apply
 
04:38:10.849 --> 04:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
there should be no reason to be wasting
 
04:38:13.010 --> 04:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
application fees
 
04:38:15.230 --> 04:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
we usually do that all right our
 
04:38:17.150 --> 04:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
applicants I think he's really happy to
 
04:38:18.590 --> 04:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
take questions questions for this
 
04:38:18.600 --> 04:38:20.750 align:start position:0%
take questions questions for this
Witness

04:38:20.750 --> 04:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
04:38:22.849 --> 04:38:22.859 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:30.890 --> 04:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:38:33.410 --> 04:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
committee my name is David Klein a
 
04:38:35.631 --> 04:38:35.641 align:start position:0%
couple couple of points I do reiterate
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh what Nick said about the actual cost
 
04:38:40.849 --> 04:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
the 35 is arbitrarily picked because of
 
04:38:43.490 --> 04:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
the states are doing it it really does
 
04:38:45.769 --> 04:38:45.779 align:start position:0%
cost more to do it depending upon the
 
04:38:47.810 --> 04:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
reports in the time of staffed to
 
04:38:50.390 --> 04:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
confirm employment and confirm prior
 
04:38:52.490 --> 04:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
landlords we have had
 
04:38:54.769 --> 04:38:54.779 align:start position:0%
in our instances people who put down
 
04:38:56.209 --> 04:38:56.219 align:start position:0%
Employments they've never worked there
 
04:38:59.090 --> 04:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
landlords they've never lived with
 
04:39:01.429 --> 04:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
I do have a real problem with this not
 
04:39:03.529 --> 04:39:03.539 align:start position:0%
being indexed for inflation any of us
 
04:39:05.209 --> 04:39:05.219 align:start position:0%
who lived through the Jerry Ford Jimmy
 
04:39:07.010 --> 04:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
Carter years know how hard that
 
04:39:09.230 --> 04:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
inflation got we have this horrendous
 
04:39:11.029 --> 04:39:11.039 align:start position:0%
situation in Ukraine we don't know what
 
04:39:12.830 --> 04:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
the future is going to be to lock us
 
04:39:14.990 --> 04:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
down to a number now that may take years
 
04:39:17.090 --> 04:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
to change if at all would be impossible
 
04:39:19.551 --> 04:39:19.561 align:start position:0%
we've tried to change the 15 fee for
 
04:39:21.170 --> 04:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
service the demand for rents and
 
04:39:23.510 --> 04:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
eviction notices no one's you know the
 
04:39:25.429 --> 04:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
tennis groups yell and scream the 15
 
04:39:27.709 --> 04:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover the cost of the labor just
 
04:39:29.750 --> 04:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
preparing the forms anymore given what
 
04:39:33.890 --> 04:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:36.830 --> 04:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
um this statute because it's part of
 
04:39:40.910 --> 04:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
540A violations of 548 become violations
 
04:39:43.310 --> 04:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
of the consumer protection statute I
 
04:39:44.810 --> 04:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
apologize I don't have the number four
 
04:39:48.350 --> 04:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
and it's in the 300s 358 358. thank you
 
04:39:51.470 --> 04:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
carries 350. hey I guess I should say
 
04:39:53.750 --> 04:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
I think you're right Mr chairman it
 
04:39:56.510 --> 04:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
carries a minimum penalty of a thousand
 
04:39:58.490 --> 04:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
dollars up to three thousand dollars and
 
04:40:01.190 --> 04:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees so that if a small
 
04:40:02.990 --> 04:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
landlord doesn't know that this is in
 
04:40:04.788 --> 04:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
fact and and that happens a lot and
 
04:40:06.530 --> 04:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why landlords
 
04:40:08.330 --> 04:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
try to band together you make a five
 
04:40:09.890 --> 04:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
dollar error you could be stuck with a
 
04:40:11.868 --> 04:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollar fine and plus the
 
04:40:15.230 --> 04:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees that's worse than uh if
 
04:40:16.850 --> 04:40:16.860 align:start position:0%
you shoplifted the five dollars except
 
04:40:18.948 --> 04:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
for you don't have face jail time so the
 
04:40:20.930 --> 04:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
the penalties are pretty severe for what
 
04:40:22.970 --> 04:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
this is and I think it that they should
 
04:40:25.490 --> 04:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
be toned down at least maybe just make
 
04:40:27.770 --> 04:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
it a flat 500 all fee if you're going to
 
04:40:30.110 --> 04:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
do that but I think that incorporating
 
04:40:32.150 --> 04:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
in the consumer protection statute is
 
04:40:34.670 --> 04:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
way above board
 
04:40:37.670 --> 04:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
also that same statute if you have these
 
04:40:39.110 --> 04:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
holding fees and you're taking them
 
04:40:42.110 --> 04:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
fraudulently a prospective tenant could
 
04:40:43.490 --> 04:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
probably use that and get their
 
04:40:45.530 --> 04:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees from the landlord who
 
04:40:46.850 --> 04:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
did that because I don't know what
 
04:40:49.190 --> 04:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
holding fees are I mean our practice was
 
04:40:51.230 --> 04:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
a deposit toward the security deposit
 
04:40:52.788 --> 04:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
and all of it we've paid over to the
 
04:40:54.230 --> 04:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
security deposit
 
04:40:55.910 --> 04:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
now the management company is just
 
04:40:57.470 --> 04:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
taking the security deposit in advance
 
04:40:57.480 --> 04:40:58.610 align:start position:0%
taking the security deposit in advance
for

04:40:58.610 --> 04:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:41:01.190 --> 04:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
finally Mr Carney I have trouble with
 
04:41:03.410 --> 04:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
this name also he said something that I
 
04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
just want to correct we are prohibited
 
04:41:08.810 --> 04:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
from taking anything in terms of rent
 
04:41:10.910 --> 04:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
and security deposit more than one
 
04:41:12.650 --> 04:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
month's rent and one month's security
 
04:41:15.470 --> 04:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
deposit in the rsas he talked about
 
04:41:16.910 --> 04:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
taking two months rent I don't know
 
04:41:18.650 --> 04:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
where he came up with that but that is
 
04:41:20.868 --> 04:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
not a legal practice in the state of New
 
04:41:20.878 --> 04:41:21.830 align:start position:0%
not a legal practice in the state of New
Hampshire

04:41:21.830 --> 04:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:41:24.050 --> 04:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
I'm open for any questions questions for
 
04:41:26.090 --> 04:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
this Witness
 
04:41:27.770 --> 04:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir
 
04:41:29.690 --> 04:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:41:32.288 --> 04:41:32.298 align:start position:0%
um next uh viola
 
04:41:34.490 --> 04:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
katsamine am I pronouncing that
 
04:41:34.500 --> 04:41:37.030 align:start position:0%
katsamine am I pronouncing that
correctly

04:41:37.030 --> 04:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:39.790 --> 04:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
I got I got it right all right

I got I got it right all right
[Laughter]

04:41:41.990 --> 04:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:41:43.610 --> 04:41:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
04:41:45.470 --> 04:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is Viola
 
04:41:47.628 --> 04:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
katsina and I'm here
 
04:41:49.368 --> 04:41:49.378 align:start position:0%
I'm here representing the granite state
 
04:41:51.530 --> 04:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
organizing project we are a graduate
 
04:41:53.208 --> 04:41:53.218 align:start position:0%
organization that's based in Manchester
 
04:41:55.310 --> 04:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
and we bring people together to work
 
04:41:57.530 --> 04:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
towards uh social justice and economic
 
04:42:00.230 --> 04:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
Justice and he had expressed our support
 
04:42:04.910 --> 04:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
for HB 283 and the reason why we're
 
04:42:07.788 --> 04:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill is that gsop opened
 
04:42:10.490 --> 04:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
up at tenant Clinic uh after the
 
04:42:12.170 --> 04:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
pandemic hit and we've been helping
 
04:42:13.910 --> 04:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
tenants on a daily basis deal with
 
04:42:16.190 --> 04:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
renovation evictions which is the bill
 
04:42:18.050 --> 04:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
that's going to come up later but I just
 
04:42:19.788 --> 04:42:19.798 align:start position:0%
wanted to share that we hear stories on
 
04:42:22.430 --> 04:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
a daily basis from people who uh whose
 
04:42:26.270 --> 04:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
application fees range from 35 to 95 and
 
04:42:27.050 --> 04:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
these are people that are already
 
04:42:29.030 --> 04:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
struggling to put together money for
 
04:42:31.610 --> 04:42:31.620 align:start position:0%
rent uh they already have housing costs
 
04:42:34.490 --> 04:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
that include moving and also like
 
04:42:36.590 --> 04:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
struggling to make basically so I'm here
 
04:42:39.410 --> 04:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
to share that that amount is pretty high
 
04:42:41.090 --> 04:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
for a lot of the tenants to deal with
 
04:42:43.368 --> 04:42:43.378 align:start position:0%
and if you are going through the
 
04:42:45.470 --> 04:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
application process this money is
 
04:42:46.788 --> 04:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
required before the application process
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
even has already gone through so you
 
04:42:50.690 --> 04:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
have to you have to pay the money before
 
04:42:53.330 --> 04:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
it's processed and in most cases some of
 
04:42:55.310 --> 04:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
them do get rejected because of their
 
04:42:57.650 --> 04:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
income qualifications and that triggers
 
04:42:59.448 --> 04:42:59.458 align:start position:0%
them to apply to another place which
 
04:43:01.368 --> 04:43:01.378 align:start position:0%
requires another application fee so at
 
04:43:03.110 --> 04:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
the end of the date adds up for families
 
04:43:05.510 --> 04:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
and for renters with a high cost of rent
 
04:43:07.850 --> 04:43:07.860 align:start position:0%
that we've had all day today uh with a
 
04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
cost of moving and just the basic living
 
04:43:12.530 --> 04:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
costs in New Hampshire I think this is
 
04:43:14.690 --> 04:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
uh a right thing to do to protect tennis
 
04:43:17.090 --> 04:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
and also to make sure that the landlords
 
04:43:18.350 --> 04:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
get covered for the course that they
 
04:43:21.530 --> 04:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
have to in car but also uh basically
 
04:43:22.910 --> 04:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
tenants are not
 
04:43:26.330 --> 04:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
um charge excessive fees so that's all I
 
04:43:27.530 --> 04:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
have to say and thank you for the
 
04:43:29.270 --> 04:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity are there questions for this
 
04:43:31.910 --> 04:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Devine thank
 
04:43:33.890 --> 04:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:43:33.900 --> 04:43:35.208 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
question

04:43:35.208 --> 04:43:35.218 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:43:35.218 --> 04:43:35.990 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:43:35.990 --> 04:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:39.470 --> 04:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
are applicant application fees in other
 
04:43:41.868 --> 04:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
states generally prohibited
 
04:43:44.448 --> 04:43:44.458 align:start position:0%
I actually I'm not quite sure about what
 
04:43:45.708 --> 04:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
other states are but I believe that
 
04:43:48.948 --> 04:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
previous speaker who's the uh Reverend
 
04:43:52.368 --> 04:43:52.378 align:start position:0%
sorry representative uh Ellen reads uh
 
04:43:55.128 --> 04:43:55.138 align:start position:0%
don't worry my friend but uh
 
04:43:57.530 --> 04:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
um she spoke a little bit about that and
 
04:43:59.448 --> 04:43:59.458 align:start position:0%
she had some information to provide so
 
04:44:01.250 --> 04:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not I can't speak to that matter
 
04:44:03.670 --> 04:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
okay maybe we could get some information
 
04:44:06.470 --> 04:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
sent to us on that matter thank you
 
04:44:11.448 --> 04:44:11.458 align:start position:0%
right other questions for this Witness
 
04:44:14.510 --> 04:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you uh Jessica
 
04:44:17.270 --> 04:44:17.280 align:start position:0%

margason please
foreign

04:44:28.970 --> 04:44:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:31.070 --> 04:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Jessica
 
04:44:33.350 --> 04:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
marteson I'm a tenant organizer with
 
04:44:35.448 --> 04:44:35.458 align:start position:0%
Granite State organizing project I am
 
04:44:37.730 --> 04:44:37.740 align:start position:0%
here on my own behalf though to speak
 
04:44:40.070 --> 04:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
out on this bill
 
04:44:43.010 --> 04:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
um I am completely for it a lot of my
 
04:44:45.368 --> 04:44:45.378 align:start position:0%
tenants that come in the tenant Clinic
 
04:44:48.050 --> 04:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
they are faced with having to apply for
 
04:44:52.490 --> 04:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
multiple Apartments as we know about the
 
04:44:52.500 --> 04:44:53.750 align:start position:0%
multiple Apartments as we know about the
um

04:44:53.750 --> 04:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:55.610 --> 04:44:55.620 align:start position:0%
sorry the word just slipped my mind we
 
04:44:57.230 --> 04:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
know about the tendency rate being low
 
04:44:59.628 --> 04:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
when it concerns an apartment that's
 
04:45:01.368 --> 04:45:01.378 align:start position:0%
under 1600 when you're looking at
 
04:45:04.310 --> 04:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
affordable what I hear from real estate
 
04:45:06.410 --> 04:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
agents or landlords is that they get
 
04:45:08.770 --> 04:45:08.780 align:start position:0%
multiple calls multiple applications
 
04:45:12.230 --> 04:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's normally the apartments that are um
 
04:45:15.350 --> 04:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
much more expensive that are out of that
 
04:45:17.090 --> 04:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
realm of being able to afford for low
 
04:45:19.610 --> 04:45:19.620 align:start position:0%
income they get fewer applications they
 
04:45:21.050 --> 04:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
get through the process a little better
 
04:45:22.990 --> 04:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
but when you have a few hundred people
 
04:45:25.430 --> 04:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
applying for only a few apartments that
 
04:45:28.128 --> 04:45:28.138 align:start position:0%
can get up there I've had to teach my
 
04:45:30.050 --> 04:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
clients to when they're looking on
 
04:45:32.510 --> 04:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
Zillow or these other sites just scroll
 
04:45:34.430 --> 04:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
down and take a look at how many
 
04:45:36.230 --> 04:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
applications have been put in on that
 
04:45:39.410 --> 04:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
one apartment you'll commonly see you
 
04:45:41.628 --> 04:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
can see some zeros but you'll see 15 17
 
04:45:43.910 --> 04:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
and sometimes up to a hundred
 
04:45:46.010 --> 04:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
so when you're charging an application
 
04:45:47.930 --> 04:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
fee on one apartment you got one spot
 
04:45:50.810 --> 04:45:50.820 align:start position:0%
and you take in a hundred applications
 
04:45:52.910 --> 04:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
you start to start making money on this
 
04:45:54.708 --> 04:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
part of the application process when it
 
04:45:57.170 --> 04:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
becomes an amount sometimes us tenants
 
04:45:58.970 --> 04:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
feel that these apartments are just
 
04:46:01.730 --> 04:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
there to generate income on applications
 
04:46:04.788 --> 04:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
because the numbers climb so high when
 
04:46:06.830 --> 04:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
you're faced with having to do
 
04:46:09.288 --> 04:46:09.298 align:start position:0%
five to ten applications in one month
 
04:46:11.390 --> 04:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
that takes away from money that you're
 
04:46:13.850 --> 04:46:13.860 align:start position:0%
going to be able to move with honestly
 
04:46:16.628 --> 04:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
we wish that there was some type of
 
04:46:20.390 --> 04:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
process you could go through and
 
04:46:22.430 --> 04:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
get your verification done and then you
 
04:46:23.990 --> 04:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
could take that from place to place and
 
04:46:25.850 --> 04:46:25.860 align:start position:0%
use it someday hopefully that bill will
 
04:46:27.890 --> 04:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
come along but one thing that should be
 
04:46:30.110 --> 04:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
added into this bill is clarification on
 
04:46:32.990 --> 04:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
time of the return of the deposit the
 
04:46:35.350 --> 04:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
250 dollars that was mentioned as a Max
 
04:46:38.750 --> 04:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
and it would be applied to the deposit
 
04:46:41.030 --> 04:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
or refunded clarification on that time
 
04:46:44.270 --> 04:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be in there so that
 
04:46:46.490 --> 04:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
um both sides have an understanding of
 
04:46:48.110 --> 04:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
when to expect that money and when to
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
return it by
 
04:46:52.190 --> 04:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions for this
 
04:46:52.200 --> 04:46:53.330 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions for this
Witness

04:46:53.330 --> 04:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
04:46:55.310 --> 04:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing none thank you very
 
04:47:09.910 --> 04:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:13.010 --> 04:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
hello uh my name is Brandon Lemay from
 
04:47:15.770 --> 04:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh and I am here speaking in
 
04:47:18.948 --> 04:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
favor of HB 283 uh I just want to
 
04:47:20.510 --> 04:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
clarify a question that was brought up
 
04:47:20.520 --> 04:47:21.708 align:start position:0%
clarify a question that was brought up
earlier

04:47:21.708 --> 04:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
04:47:24.288 --> 04:47:24.298 align:start position:0%
um about uh other rental application fee
 
04:47:27.610 --> 04:47:27.620 align:start position:0%
laws uh in the country in Massachusetts
 
04:47:30.948 --> 04:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
it's actually illegal to charge an
 
04:47:32.390 --> 04:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
application fee
 
04:47:36.170 --> 04:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
however a landlord could not run to the
 
04:47:39.110 --> 04:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
apartment under the basis of wanting to
 
04:47:41.750 --> 04:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
submit a background check first
 
04:47:44.570 --> 04:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
so the way that I see this is that
 
04:47:47.030 --> 04:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
application fees could be avoided
 
04:47:50.030 --> 04:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
altogether if this included language
 
04:47:52.730 --> 04:47:52.740 align:start position:0%
saying that hey a tenant might have to
 
04:47:54.110 --> 04:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
pay for a background check once they're
 
04:47:56.150 --> 04:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
approved for the apartment depending you
 
04:47:58.550 --> 04:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
know certain terms
 
04:47:59.510 --> 04:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:48:01.190 --> 04:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I just want to emphasize that there
 
04:48:03.350 --> 04:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
are other New England states that do
 
04:48:06.230 --> 04:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
regulate what you can actually charge or
 
04:48:09.170 --> 04:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
can you charge an application fee at all
 
04:48:10.850 --> 04:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
um the second thing and my final Point
 
04:48:13.730 --> 04:48:13.740 align:start position:0%
here is uh I work with a lot of low to
 
04:48:15.830 --> 04:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
Middle income tenants uh there's one
 
04:48:17.208 --> 04:48:17.218 align:start position:0%
tenant who's actually unfortunately at
 
04:48:18.288 --> 04:48:18.298 align:start position:0%
work today I wish I could have brought
 
04:48:19.550 --> 04:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
her up
 
04:48:22.850 --> 04:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
um but back in 2021 she had to apply for
 
04:48:26.030 --> 04:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
no fewer than 12 apartments and had over
 
04:48:28.850 --> 04:48:28.860 align:start position:0%
300 in application fees
 
04:48:31.970 --> 04:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
and it's really demoralizing when you
 
04:48:33.770 --> 04:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
have to Shell up money that you probably
 
04:48:36.830 --> 04:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to get a place that you might
 
04:48:38.868 --> 04:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
not even be able to live in
 
04:48:41.750 --> 04:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
so it's really prohibitive and you have
 
04:48:43.270 --> 04:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
to selectively apply to Apartments
 
04:48:46.730 --> 04:48:46.740 align:start position:0%
especially when the uh the vacancy rate
 
04:48:48.170 --> 04:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
is so low
 
04:48:48.180 --> 04:48:49.490 align:start position:0%
is so low
so

04:48:49.490 --> 04:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:52.788 --> 04:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
I think that there's a huge problem and
 
04:48:54.770 --> 04:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
there have been other stories of
 
04:48:57.490 --> 04:48:57.500 align:start position:0%
landlords who show empty Apartments
 
04:49:00.590 --> 04:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh for the prospect of charging them
 
04:49:02.990 --> 04:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
application fees so
 
04:49:06.650 --> 04:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
in my belief I believe that perhaps
 
04:49:09.410 --> 04:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
there should be some sort of fee maybe
 
04:49:11.448 --> 04:49:11.458 align:start position:0%
after you've been accepted pending any
 
04:49:14.448 --> 04:49:14.458 align:start position:0%
sort of like serious uh any sort of
 
04:49:16.190 --> 04:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
serious like things on the record or
 
04:49:17.868 --> 04:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
previous evictions
 
04:49:20.030 --> 04:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh but I feel like this is a reasonable
 
04:49:24.050 --> 04:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
Bill uh 35 is a reasonable amount to pay
 
04:49:25.970 --> 04:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
for an application fee that can get you
 
04:49:28.128 --> 04:49:28.138 align:start position:0%
most of a background check and a credit
 
04:49:30.890 --> 04:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
score check uh so I don't find this to
 
04:49:33.650 --> 04:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
be um completely out there so I hope
 
04:49:35.868 --> 04:49:35.878 align:start position:0%
that you uh vote ought to pass and I'll
 
04:49:37.430 --> 04:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
take any questions all right questions
 
04:49:40.128 --> 04:49:40.138 align:start position:0%
for this Witness
 
04:49:42.230 --> 04:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir all
 
04:49:43.368 --> 04:49:43.378 align:start position:0%

Hampshire and I also serve on an
 
04:50:38.330 --> 04:50:38.340 align:start position:0%
advocacy committee that the agency has
 
04:50:41.030 --> 04:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
so we assist individuals and families
 
04:50:42.890 --> 04:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
who are struggling with housing
 
04:50:45.948 --> 04:50:45.958 align:start position:0%

04:50:48.170 --> 04:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
homelessness we provide financial
 
04:50:51.470 --> 04:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
assistance some case management and run
 
04:50:53.628 --> 04:50:53.638 align:start position:0%
a transitional housing program for young

single mothers all to help prevent
 
04:50:55.860 --> 04:50:57.350 align:start position:0%
single mothers all to help prevent
homelessness

04:50:57.350 --> 04:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
04:50:59.868 --> 04:50:59.878 align:start position:0%
in the past few years we have seen this
 
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
housing crisis Skyrocket when people
 
04:51:04.910 --> 04:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
talk about it a housing crisis it's it's
 
04:51:06.110 --> 04:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
no joke
 
04:51:08.810 --> 04:51:08.820 align:start position:0%
in a typical month our agency receives
 
04:51:11.690 --> 04:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
about 10 applications for assistance in
 
04:51:15.288 --> 04:51:15.298 align:start position:0%
December this year we received 45 and so
 
04:51:18.770 --> 04:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
far in January we've received over 35.
 
04:51:21.170 --> 04:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
both the number of applicants and the
 
04:51:23.810 --> 04:51:23.820 align:start position:0%
level of Crisis we see is worsening
 
04:51:26.868 --> 04:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
significantly those on fixed incomes are
 
04:51:29.030 --> 04:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
hardest hit especially those forced from
 
04:51:31.368 --> 04:51:31.378 align:start position:0%
their homes due to a property sale
 
04:51:34.250 --> 04:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
people are facing multiple barriers in
 
04:51:36.530 --> 04:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
securing housing one of those being
 
04:51:39.410 --> 04:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
application fees and or hold fees there
 
04:51:42.530 --> 04:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
are not always refundable I've received
 
04:51:46.368 --> 04:51:46.378 align:start position:0%
reports from clients of fees up to 250
 
04:51:49.490 --> 04:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
dollars generally we do not have the
 
04:51:52.250 --> 04:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
capacity to assist with those fees so I
 
04:51:54.770 --> 04:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
contacted rep Ellen Reid and requested
 
04:51:58.010 --> 04:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
some help on the legislative front and
 
04:52:01.610 --> 04:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
you can imagine that with a .06 percent
 
04:52:04.550 --> 04:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate for rentals property
 
04:52:06.948 --> 04:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
managers are receiving upwards of 20
 
04:52:09.890 --> 04:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
applications per apartment we work with
 
04:52:12.530 --> 04:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
landlords all of the time and they're
 
04:52:13.970 --> 04:52:13.980 align:start position:0%
frequently telling us they are
 
04:52:16.190 --> 04:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely inundated with applications
 
04:52:19.910 --> 04:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
for every single unit they're renting so
 
04:52:22.430 --> 04:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
they can make quite the income from fees
 
04:52:24.288 --> 04:52:24.298 align:start position:0%
that they charge
 
04:52:26.810 --> 04:52:26.820 align:start position:0%
um while it's just another one of many
 
04:52:29.090 --> 04:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
significant barriers for our low-income
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
neighbors we're regularly seeing people
 
04:52:33.170 --> 04:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire forced into
 
04:52:35.090 --> 04:52:35.100 align:start position:0%
homelessness through no fault of their
 
04:52:37.930 --> 04:52:37.940 align:start position:0%
own but for the rising costs of property
 
04:52:41.208 --> 04:52:41.218 align:start position:0%
shelters are full funds for hotels are
 
04:52:43.430 --> 04:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
limited and people are being evicted
 
04:52:47.390 --> 04:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
from encampments passing HB 283 would
 
04:52:50.270 --> 04:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
allow property managers to recoup some
 
04:52:52.970 --> 04:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
of their costs for doing business with
 
04:52:55.670 --> 04:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
minimal negative impact while it would
 
04:52:58.610 --> 04:52:58.620 align:start position:0%
have a significant positive impact on
 
04:53:01.788 --> 04:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
one of the barriers to housing stability
 
04:53:03.650 --> 04:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
um I do want to mention that refereed
 
04:53:06.708 --> 04:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
did email you all info on fees in other
 
04:53:09.170 --> 04:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
states many states do not charge fees
 
04:53:12.470 --> 04:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
many limit them and I can attest to the
 
04:53:14.510 --> 04:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
fact that many people are prohibited
 
04:53:17.208 --> 04:53:17.218 align:start position:0%
just from applying for an apartment
 
04:53:20.208 --> 04:53:20.218 align:start position:0%
simply because if they can't afford the
 
04:53:23.330 --> 04:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
fees never mind the rent so happy to
 
04:53:25.430 --> 04:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
take any questions questions for this
 
04:53:28.070 --> 04:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Qatar
 
04:53:30.590 --> 04:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
so you stated that this Bell would still
 
04:53:33.050 --> 04:53:33.060 align:start position:0%
allow landlords to recoup some of their
 
04:53:34.368 --> 04:53:34.378 align:start position:0%
fees but I'm a little bit confused
 
04:53:36.530 --> 04:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
because the way that I'm reading this is
 
04:53:36.540 --> 04:53:37.490 align:start position:0%
because the way that I'm reading this is
that

04:53:37.490 --> 04:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:53:40.430 --> 04:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
these fees have to be refundable so how
 
04:53:42.050 --> 04:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
are they recouping the fees if they have
 
04:53:44.628 --> 04:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
to give them all back so the um
 
04:53:47.030 --> 04:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
background check fees are not refundable
 
04:53:50.690 --> 04:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
it would be hold fees I believe
 
04:53:52.970 --> 04:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a copy of it it's the
 
04:53:55.730 --> 04:53:55.740 align:start position:0%
hold fees would a refundable the
 
04:53:57.708 --> 04:53:57.718 align:start position:0%
application fee for the background check
 
04:54:00.350 --> 04:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
which is at 35 or the cost of the
 
04:54:02.270 --> 04:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
background check is not refundable
 
04:54:05.868 --> 04:54:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:09.050 --> 04:54:09.060 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative Perez
 
04:54:11.110 --> 04:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:54:14.930 --> 04:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
why are these people when they apply and
 
04:54:16.490 --> 04:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
they do not
 
04:54:19.730 --> 04:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
obtain the apartment are they told why
 
04:54:23.050 --> 04:54:23.060 align:start position:0%
they didn't qualify for the apartment
 
04:54:26.090 --> 04:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
not necessarily no not when landlords
 
04:54:28.310 --> 04:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
are receiving up to upwards of 20
 
04:54:30.470 --> 04:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
applications they they don't even reach
 
04:54:32.810 --> 04:54:32.820 align:start position:0%
out to them if you apply for a job you
 
04:54:35.628 --> 04:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
don't always get a you know a reason why
 
04:54:37.010 --> 04:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
you were turned down it's the same with
 
04:54:39.288 --> 04:54:39.298 align:start position:0%
when you apply for an apartment so it's
 
04:54:41.810 --> 04:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
simply it's business one apartment and
 
04:54:44.390 --> 04:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
there's multiple applicants with the
 
04:54:47.750 --> 04:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate being virtually zero right
 
04:54:47.760 --> 04:54:48.470 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate being virtually zero right
now

04:54:48.470 --> 04:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:54:52.190 --> 04:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
so it's not that they're not able to get
 
04:54:53.690 --> 04:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
the apartment or afford the apartment
 
04:54:56.868 --> 04:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
they're just lost in line yeah so you've
 
04:54:59.810 --> 04:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
got one apartment 20 30 40 applicants
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
and only one person is going to get that
 
04:55:01.680 --> 04:55:02.868 align:start position:0%
and only one person is going to get that
apartment

04:55:02.868 --> 04:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
04:55:05.330 --> 04:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
04:55:05.340 --> 04:55:06.948 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this

04:55:09.230 --> 04:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
oh representative mine yes thank you
 
04:55:11.150 --> 04:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:55:12.708 --> 04:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:55:15.590 --> 04:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
um when a landlord I'm just trying to
 
04:55:17.750 --> 04:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
get this wrap my head around this when a
 
04:55:20.208 --> 04:55:20.218 align:start position:0%
landlord is receiving maybe up to 10
 
04:55:23.810 --> 04:55:23.820 align:start position:0%
applications with a 35 dollar fee and
 
04:55:25.610 --> 04:55:25.620 align:start position:0%
they start to run through it this person
 
04:55:28.190 --> 04:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
qualifies this person qualifies this
 
04:55:30.948 --> 04:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
person qualifies do they just stop do
 
04:55:32.750 --> 04:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
they stop at the first one and then go
 
04:55:34.128 --> 04:55:34.138 align:start position:0%
through the process or do they go
 
04:55:37.850 --> 04:55:37.860 align:start position:0%
through all 10 applications with the 35
 
04:55:41.150 --> 04:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
dollar fee and then you know
 
04:55:44.090 --> 04:55:44.100 align:start position:0%
take that and and then do they give the
 
04:55:46.310 --> 04:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
money back if they decide on one
 
04:55:49.310 --> 04:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
person to take the apartment sure so I
 
04:55:51.050 --> 04:55:51.060 align:start position:0%
think that probably varies from landlord
 
04:55:52.730 --> 04:55:52.740 align:start position:0%
to landlord as to how much time and
 
04:55:55.128 --> 04:55:55.138 align:start position:0%
effort they want to invest in vetting
 
04:55:58.550 --> 04:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
their various applicants
 
04:56:01.390 --> 04:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
um but the fees can be upwards of 35
 
04:56:04.430 --> 04:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's fifty dollars
 
04:56:06.470 --> 04:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
um so this bill is sort of it's trying
 
04:56:09.050 --> 04:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
to put a limit on what the fee what the
 
04:56:11.690 --> 04:56:11.700 align:start position:0%
limit on the fee is
 
04:56:13.430 --> 04:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
um was there a second part to your
 
04:56:16.070 --> 04:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
question well I would move to change
 
04:56:17.570 --> 04:56:17.580 align:start position:0%
that you know like I'm thinking about
 
04:56:20.990 --> 04:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
this 35 fee and I'm I'm thinking that
 
04:56:24.350 --> 04:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
you know the landlord is is taking in
 
04:56:27.050 --> 04:56:27.060 align:start position:0%
this income they're they're offering a
 
04:56:29.810 --> 04:56:29.820 align:start position:0%
rental property if they do vet the
 
04:56:32.030 --> 04:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
person shouldn't they be doing their due
 
04:56:34.430 --> 04:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
diligence to kind of look through the
 
04:56:36.530 --> 04:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
the applications first before they use
 
04:56:39.410 --> 04:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
the 35 to pay for you know something
 
04:56:41.208 --> 04:56:41.218 align:start position:0%
that maybe
 
04:56:45.110 --> 04:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
um a potential renter cannot afford and
 
04:56:48.830 --> 04:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
they're just seeing seems like this this
 
04:56:50.930 --> 04:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know it does it just doesn't
 
04:56:52.910 --> 04:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
work for me I'm thinking take take away
 
04:56:54.890 --> 04:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
the whole 35 dollars take away the cost
 
04:56:59.868 --> 04:56:59.878 align:start position:0%
put the put the um the um cost on to the
 
04:57:02.510 --> 04:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
landlord for that fee because they're
 
04:57:05.990 --> 04:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
offering a service to the community and
 
04:57:08.628 --> 04:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
to me that bill might work a little bit
 
04:57:08.638 --> 04:57:09.530 align:start position:0%
to me that bill might work a little bit
better

04:57:09.530 --> 04:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:57:13.190 --> 04:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
so you're you're suggesting no fees no
 
04:57:15.590 --> 04:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
fees at all so we were trying to appease
 
04:57:17.690 --> 04:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
I believe landlords and allow them to
 
04:57:20.448 --> 04:57:20.458 align:start position:0%
recoup some of their costs but I would
 
04:57:22.550 --> 04:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
be in favor of no fees and I believe
 
04:57:25.490 --> 04:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
other states such as Vermont
 
04:57:28.490 --> 04:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
um do not and possibly Massachusetts do
 
04:57:31.970 --> 04:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
not charge fees at all for this reason
 
04:57:35.270 --> 04:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
so and then the last part would be as an
 
04:57:37.490 --> 04:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
alternative to landlords they would have
 
04:57:39.708 --> 04:57:39.718 align:start position:0%
to be if you kept the bill in place as
 
04:57:42.830 --> 04:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
it was the landlord would have to have
 
04:57:44.570 --> 04:57:44.580 align:start position:0%
some sort of accountability as to how
 
04:57:46.128 --> 04:57:46.138 align:start position:0%
many applications they would be seeing
 
04:57:49.250 --> 04:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
and viewing and using that 35 or more
 
04:57:51.410 --> 04:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
whatever they're charging there has to
 
04:57:52.730 --> 04:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
be some accountability here and this
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
bill here does not demonstrate that in
 
04:57:56.750 --> 04:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
my opinion
 
04:57:59.030 --> 04:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
I think there's definitely room for
 
04:58:01.490 --> 04:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
amendments in the middle
 
04:58:01.500 --> 04:58:02.208 align:start position:0%
amendments in the middle
um

04:58:02.208 --> 04:58:02.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:06.650 --> 04:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
other other questions for this Witness
 
04:58:08.750 --> 04:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh so I guess I just have a question are
 
04:58:12.650 --> 04:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
do you have any concern that to the
 
04:58:16.550 --> 04:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
extent you this bill limits
 
04:58:18.770 --> 04:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:58:22.368 --> 04:58:22.378 align:start position:0%
the the the ability of a of a landlord
 
04:58:25.330 --> 04:58:25.340 align:start position:0%
to charge fees for rental applications
 
04:58:28.970 --> 04:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
to the extent landlords feel as a result
 
04:58:32.510 --> 04:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
of that they feel less secure in who
 
04:58:35.930 --> 04:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
they get for tenants that the way they
 
04:58:38.090 --> 04:58:38.100 align:start position:0%
will account for that insecurity is that
 
04:58:40.070 --> 04:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
they'll just raise the rents the rents
 
04:58:42.050 --> 04:58:42.060 align:start position:0%
the rents will just be you you're you
 
04:58:43.910 --> 04:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
can't charge more than 35 dollars for a
 
04:58:45.830 --> 04:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
rental application and the landlord says
 
04:58:49.128 --> 04:58:49.138 align:start position:0%
uh well not now I feel less secure in
 
04:58:51.288 --> 04:58:51.298 align:start position:0%
who I'm going to have for tenants so the
 
04:58:53.990 --> 04:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
rent goes up I'm not sure that I
 
04:58:55.788 --> 04:58:55.798 align:start position:0%
understand that the cost of the
 
04:58:58.850 --> 04:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
application equates to a quality of the
 
04:58:58.860 --> 04:59:00.350 align:start position:0%
application equates to a quality of the
applicant

04:59:00.350 --> 04:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
applicant
 
04:59:02.448 --> 04:59:02.458 align:start position:0%
um they would be able to submit a
 
04:59:05.150 --> 04:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
background check and the cost for the
 
04:59:07.610 --> 04:59:07.620 align:start position:0%
background check whatever that is is
 
04:59:10.430 --> 04:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
covered in the bill and there's always a
 
04:59:13.390 --> 04:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
cost to doing business and right now
 
04:59:17.150 --> 04:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
landlords have their pick of applicants
 
04:59:20.150 --> 04:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
and are generally taking the people with
 
04:59:23.090 --> 04:59:23.100 align:start position:0%
the highest incomes and so those people
 
04:59:25.190 --> 04:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
on Lower incomes people who are
 
04:59:27.590 --> 04:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
receiving housing vouchers are
 
04:59:31.250 --> 04:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
effectively blocked from from renting on
 
04:59:33.350 --> 04:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
the market quite frequently and then
 
04:59:36.650 --> 04:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
this application fee that's charged
 
04:59:40.010 --> 04:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
um on top of that is another barrier and
 
04:59:43.368 --> 04:59:43.378 align:start position:0%
I think the 35 of the the bill covers 35
 
04:59:46.430 --> 04:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
or the cost of a background check so I
 
04:59:47.750 --> 04:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
think that should give the landlord
 
04:59:49.730 --> 04:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
whichever the bill says whichever is
 
04:59:54.650 --> 04:59:54.660 align:start position:0%
less so 35 is the cap okay okay
 
04:59:57.708 --> 04:59:57.718 align:start position:0%
um I think that that covers the general
 
04:59:59.690 --> 04:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
cost of a background check we serve as
 
05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
property managers ourselves I manage
 
05:00:04.970 --> 05:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
eight affordable housing units
 
05:00:09.590 --> 05:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
um and we pay 25 for a background check
 
05:00:11.750 --> 05:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
and I would also like to mention that
 
05:00:14.090 --> 05:00:14.100 align:start position:0%
herd has recently issued guidance that
 
05:00:15.948 --> 05:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
background checks should actually
 
05:00:18.410 --> 05:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
they're recommending people don't do
 
05:00:20.270 --> 05:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
05:00:22.490 --> 05:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
um which seems a little bizarre to us as
 
05:00:24.470 --> 05:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
property managers but that seems like
 
05:00:26.390 --> 05:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
the way things are going and that was
 
05:00:29.750 --> 05:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
their guidance at a recent training
 
05:00:31.250 --> 05:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
so I think there's plenty of
 
05:00:33.170 --> 05:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
opportunities for landlords to properly
 
05:00:35.570 --> 05:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
vet their applicants and given their
 
05:00:38.868 --> 05:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate they can cert they are most
 
05:00:41.690 --> 05:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
certainly doing that very well thank you
 
05:00:43.128 --> 05:00:43.138 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
05:00:45.170 --> 05:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
greeson thank you Mr Sharon thank you
 
05:00:47.150 --> 05:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
for answering our questions ma'am
 
05:00:49.490 --> 05:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
would it be acceptable
 
05:00:52.368 --> 05:00:52.378 align:start position:0%
that if uh
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
fees no fees may be charged unless an
 
05:00:59.990 --> 05:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
application has been accepted for review
 
05:01:02.448 --> 05:01:02.458 align:start position:0%
and then the lease would be tentative to
 
05:01:05.090 --> 05:01:05.100 align:start position:0%
awaiting the results of that background
 
05:01:07.070 --> 05:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
check which can include a credit check
 
05:01:08.570 --> 05:01:08.580 align:start position:0%
criminal background check their tenancy
 
05:01:11.208 --> 05:01:11.218 align:start position:0%
record then collection of those fees
 
05:01:14.390 --> 05:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
would occur at least signing
 
05:01:15.890 --> 05:01:15.900 align:start position:0%
and then the landlord would have to
 
05:01:17.750 --> 05:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
disclose the amount of those fees prior
 
05:01:20.390 --> 05:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
to receipt of an application so that the
 
05:01:21.948 --> 05:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
tenant is going to know going in it's
 
05:01:23.990 --> 05:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
going to cost me X number of dollars to
 
05:01:25.610 --> 05:01:25.620 align:start position:0%
eat to apply I'm going to have to pay
 
05:01:27.590 --> 05:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
for it at some point in time so they
 
05:01:28.730 --> 05:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
decide I'm going to fill out the
 
05:01:29.930 --> 05:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
application I'm going to submit the
 
05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
application the landlord takes the
 
05:01:33.170 --> 05:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
application does the background checks
 
05:01:36.170 --> 05:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
and now they can charge that fee
 
05:01:38.868 --> 05:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
so they would charge
 
05:01:41.690 --> 05:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
not only the person they're renting to
 
05:01:44.448 --> 05:01:44.458 align:start position:0%
but whoever they might consider the
 
05:01:46.850 --> 05:01:46.860 align:start position:0%
people whose application they accept no
 
05:01:48.830 --> 05:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
only the person they can only collect a
 
05:01:50.990 --> 05:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
fee from the person who you've accepted
 
05:01:52.610 --> 05:01:52.620 align:start position:0%
the application from and are going to
 
05:01:54.470 --> 05:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
lease the unit too
 
05:01:56.208 --> 05:01:56.218 align:start position:0%
so somebody goes out and puts out a
 
05:01:58.070 --> 05:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
thousand applications they're only going
 
05:01:58.930 --> 05:01:58.940 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
05:02:02.230 --> 05:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
one fee to wherever they sign the lease
 
05:02:05.570 --> 05:02:05.580 align:start position:0%
I I think from a somebody that
 
05:02:07.670 --> 05:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
represents tenants that would be
 
05:02:11.350 --> 05:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
favorable as a property manager
 
05:02:15.530 --> 05:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
we may want to not incur the cost of a
 
05:02:18.288 --> 05:02:18.298 align:start position:0%
background check on three or four
 
05:02:20.510 --> 05:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
applicants wow it's one or the other
 
05:02:21.650 --> 05:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
isn't it
 
05:02:23.930 --> 05:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
sorry it's one or the others let's not
 
05:02:26.030 --> 05:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
turn this let's not I'm not debating I'm
 
05:02:27.230 --> 05:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
just it's one or the other it's either
 
05:02:29.750 --> 05:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
the landlords or the tenants right
 
05:02:31.250 --> 05:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan did you have a
 
05:02:31.260 --> 05:02:32.090 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan did you have a
question

05:02:32.090 --> 05:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:02:33.170 --> 05:02:33.180 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
05:02:35.628 --> 05:02:35.638 align:start position:0%
I guess based on uh
 
05:02:37.490 --> 05:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
since you've your experienced on both
 
05:02:39.170 --> 05:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
sides that the landlord tenant divide
 
05:02:41.570 --> 05:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
also renting out of affordable
 
05:02:43.810 --> 05:02:43.820 align:start position:0%
apartments which are probably still not
 
05:02:47.750 --> 05:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
not all that affordable but still
 
05:02:49.610 --> 05:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
um but uh obviously less than what the
 
05:02:52.310 --> 05:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
market rate Apartments do you find find
 
05:02:54.770 --> 05:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
this difficult to cover all the various
 
05:02:57.590 --> 05:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
overhead charges that are you know part
 
05:02:59.570 --> 05:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
of your business or do you find that
 
05:03:01.970 --> 05:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
you're able to pay for it fairly easily
 
05:03:03.650 --> 05:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
out of the rent and
 
05:03:07.430 --> 05:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
we receive various grants and funding so
 
05:03:09.948 --> 05:03:09.958 align:start position:0%
um we the rents that we charge which are
 
05:03:12.410 --> 05:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
minimal and they're usually monitored by
 
05:03:15.170 --> 05:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
Hud under the home program so they're
 
05:03:19.150 --> 05:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
very closely regulated but yes we I mean
 
05:03:22.090 --> 05:03:22.100 align:start position:0%
we would be happy with a very nominal
 
05:03:25.670 --> 05:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
fee charged I'm concerned that landlords
 
05:03:29.390 --> 05:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
will oppose this bill in Force if they
 
05:03:34.448 --> 05:03:34.458 align:start position:0%
are prohibited from receiving any
 
05:03:38.448 --> 05:03:38.458 align:start position:0%
recompense for the fees they incur
 
05:03:40.670 --> 05:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
um but I do there's has to be something
 
05:03:42.590 --> 05:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
done because there are so many barriers
 
05:03:46.010 --> 05:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
right now two people finding housing
 
05:03:48.590 --> 05:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
this crisis I've spoken to three people
 
05:03:51.288 --> 05:03:51.298 align:start position:0%
in the three hours I was in my office
 
05:03:53.150 --> 05:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
this morning that was sleeping in their
 
05:03:53.160 --> 05:03:54.288 align:start position:0%
this morning that was sleeping in their
car

05:03:54.288 --> 05:03:54.298 align:start position:0%
car
 
05:03:57.530 --> 05:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
today it's snowing and there is no room
 
05:03:59.628 --> 05:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
in the shelters and they can't afford a
 
05:03:59.638 --> 05:04:00.670 align:start position:0%
in the shelters and they can't afford a
hotel

05:04:00.670 --> 05:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
hotel
 
05:04:04.750 --> 05:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
and if whatever we can do
 
05:04:08.330 --> 05:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
to ameliorate this crisis needs to be
 
05:04:11.330 --> 05:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
done and whatever it is it's a little
 
05:04:14.270 --> 05:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
too little too late at this point
 
05:04:17.628 --> 05:04:17.638 align:start position:0%
um you know I speak to people daily who
 
05:04:19.010 --> 05:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
are in tears
 
05:04:22.010 --> 05:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
and it's really frustrating that as a
 
05:04:24.310 --> 05:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
state we're seeing this level of Crisis
 
05:04:28.610 --> 05:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
and we need to do whatever is in our
 
05:04:32.330 --> 05:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
power to help alleviate the crisis
 
05:04:35.150 --> 05:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
There's real people today sleeping in
 
05:04:37.850 --> 05:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
their cars who have jobs and who are
 
05:04:40.550 --> 05:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
working and have lost their housing so I
 
05:04:43.670 --> 05:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
would just ask that we do something to
 
05:04:46.128 --> 05:04:46.138 align:start position:0%
make this process a little easier what
 
05:04:48.530 --> 05:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
the specifics are like being put on the
 
05:04:50.510 --> 05:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
spot at the very minute I'd need some
 
05:04:53.510 --> 05:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
time to really kind of consider it
 
05:04:56.208 --> 05:04:56.218 align:start position:0%
um I'm not I don't write legislation so
 
05:04:58.850 --> 05:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
I don't know the legal specifics of it
 
05:05:01.490 --> 05:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
but happy to answer any more questions
 
05:05:03.590 --> 05:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
because this is a really really really
 
05:05:06.650 --> 05:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
important issue right now questions for
 
05:05:08.090 --> 05:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
this Witness
 
05:05:10.368 --> 05:05:10.378 align:start position:0%

and I'm here today excited to bring you
 
05:06:22.910 --> 05:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
HB 340 a bill that I have dubbed the
 
05:06:25.250 --> 05:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
save our homes act and I'd like to
 
05:06:27.110 --> 05:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
explain the bill on a cosmic level by
 
05:06:28.730 --> 05:06:28.740 align:start position:0%
reading from an op-ed that I submitted
 
05:06:30.350 --> 05:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire Business review about
 
05:06:32.030 --> 05:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
it last fall
 
05:06:36.410 --> 05:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
on June 11 2021 you know we can I mean
 
05:06:38.930 --> 05:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
we can read the editorial if you want to
 
05:06:40.788 --> 05:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that it's not that's not
 
05:06:43.730 --> 05:06:43.740 align:start position:0%
word for word okay all right go ahead
 
05:06:46.850 --> 05:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
uh on June 11 2021 the Fox News YouTube
 
05:06:48.470 --> 05:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
channel posted a clip of their host
 
05:06:50.030 --> 05:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
Tucker Carlson talking about a
 
05:06:51.288 --> 05:06:51.298 align:start position:0%
little-known but very impactful
 
05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
Corporation BlackRock Tucker a man I
 
05:06:56.390 --> 05:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
disagree with 99 of the time spoke about
 
05:06:58.368 --> 05:06:58.378 align:start position:0%
how BlackRock is slowly but surely
 
05:07:00.470 --> 05:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
gobbling up homes in many parts of
 
05:07:02.750 --> 05:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
America by outbidding families looking
 
05:07:04.788 --> 05:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
to buy them why would a venture capital
 
05:07:06.590 --> 05:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
firm offer two hundred thousand dollars
 
05:07:07.990 --> 05:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
over the asking price for homes
 
05:07:10.850 --> 05:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing they win the bid once they
 
05:07:12.470 --> 05:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
own the home they can rent it forever
 
05:07:15.350 --> 05:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
making far more in profits and they do
 
05:07:17.150 --> 05:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
according to an article posted in the
 
05:07:19.368 --> 05:07:19.378 align:start position:0%
Atlantic a quarter of all single-family
 
05:07:21.650 --> 05:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
homes went to landlords aspiring Airbnb
 
05:07:24.170 --> 05:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
tycoons and other types of investors all
 
05:07:25.850 --> 05:07:25.860 align:start position:0%
told nearly a third of American house
 
05:07:27.530 --> 05:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
sales last year went to people who had
 
05:07:29.330 --> 05:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
no intention of living in them
 
05:07:31.310 --> 05:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
this type of manufactured scarcity and
 
05:07:32.990 --> 05:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
consolidation drives up the cost of
 
05:07:35.030 --> 05:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
owning a home inflating selling prices
 
05:07:36.890 --> 05:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
leads other Home sellers to raise their
 
05:07:38.868 --> 05:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
prices to pull in more money and who
 
05:07:40.070 --> 05:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want an extra two hundred
 
05:07:42.170 --> 05:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars when selling their home
 
05:07:43.490 --> 05:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
but there's something else that we're
 
05:07:44.990 --> 05:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
giving away by allowing these massive
 
05:07:47.090 --> 05:07:47.100 align:start position:0%
corporate conglomerates to buy up all of
 
05:07:49.010 --> 05:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
America's homes and rent them to the end
 
05:07:51.288 --> 05:07:51.298 align:start position:0%
of time and see American Dream
 
05:07:52.730 --> 05:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
for the last several Generations
 
05:07:54.410 --> 05:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
Americans have relied on single-family
 
05:07:56.150 --> 05:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
homes to build a nest egg for retirement
 
05:07:57.830 --> 05:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
and nowadays I wouldn't count on a
 
05:07:59.690 --> 05:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
social security check given what a fit
 
05:08:01.368 --> 05:08:01.378 align:start position:0%
Congress through about veterans benefits
 
05:08:02.390 --> 05:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
last year
 
05:08:04.368 --> 05:08:04.378 align:start position:0%
they allow you to build equity they're a
 
05:08:06.170 --> 05:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
place to raise a family they allow your
 
05:08:07.730 --> 05:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
kids to stay in the same Community long
 
05:08:09.590 --> 05:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
enough to make friends get involved with
 
05:08:11.448 --> 05:08:11.458 align:start position:0%
their local community center and save
 
05:08:13.128 --> 05:08:13.138 align:start position:0%
them the experience of moving every year
 
05:08:14.628 --> 05:08:14.638 align:start position:0%
as often has to happen with Apartments
 
05:08:17.448 --> 05:08:17.458 align:start position:0%
they provide family stability homes
 
05:08:19.128 --> 05:08:19.138 align:start position:0%
build communities
 
05:08:21.110 --> 05:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
if you're hearing this ask your kids if
 
05:08:23.448 --> 05:08:23.458 align:start position:0%
they or people they think or people
 
05:08:25.128 --> 05:08:25.138 align:start position:0%
their age think that home ownership will
 
05:08:26.448 --> 05:08:26.458 align:start position:0%
ever be in their grasp and the answer
 
05:08:28.128 --> 05:08:28.138 align:start position:0%
you're probably going to get is no
 
05:08:29.868 --> 05:08:29.878 align:start position:0%
this is a tragedy in the wealthiest
 
05:08:31.310 --> 05:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
nation in the world where we are blessed
 
05:08:33.170 --> 05:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
by abundance and opportunity but it's
 
05:08:34.910 --> 05:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
our responsibility to defend that
 
05:08:34.920 --> 05:08:35.990 align:start position:0%
our responsibility to defend that
opportunity

05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
05:08:37.310 --> 05:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
that's why I brought this bill before
 
05:08:39.708 --> 05:08:39.718 align:start position:0%
you today the bill is simple
 
05:08:41.510 --> 05:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
real estate on which single-family
 
05:08:43.368 --> 05:08:43.378 align:start position:0%
housing including single-family housing
 
05:08:45.050 --> 05:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
with one or more accessory dwelling
 
05:08:47.208 --> 05:08:47.218 align:start position:0%
units on the same parcel of land or
 
05:08:49.550 --> 05:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
multi-family housing is located may only
 
05:08:51.830 --> 05:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
be acquired in whole or in part by
 
05:08:53.990 --> 05:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
natural persons subject to the following
 
05:08:56.750 --> 05:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
exceptions in basic terms the bill will
 
05:08:58.490 --> 05:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
require single-family homes to be sold
 
05:09:01.490 --> 05:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
to a real living breathing person not a
 
05:09:03.350 --> 05:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
venture capital firm not a venture
 
05:09:05.030 --> 05:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
capital firm putting on the Groucho Marx
 
05:09:06.650 --> 05:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
disguised and pretending to be an LLC
 
05:09:06.660 --> 05:09:08.030 align:start position:0%

there's a grandfathering exception

provided that the next buyer is a

natural person
 
05:09:14.990 --> 05:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
there's a development exception provided

that the property is sold to a natural
 
05:09:18.830 --> 05:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
person within two years and there's a
 
05:09:20.270 --> 05:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
clarification that this will have no
 
05:09:22.730 --> 05:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
impact on mortgages or trusts
 
05:09:24.350 --> 05:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
I and the other co-sponsors believe it
 
05:09:25.910 --> 05:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
is important to keep family homes for
 
05:09:27.830 --> 05:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
families we believe that passing this
 
05:09:29.208 --> 05:09:29.218 align:start position:0%
law will help reduce and eliminate
 
05:09:31.250 --> 05:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
homelessness in our time we will not
 
05:09:33.050 --> 05:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
allow soulless conglomerate corporations
 
05:09:35.750 --> 05:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
to deny anybody the American dream we
 
05:09:37.490 --> 05:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
feel now is the time to do this for if
 
05:09:39.170 --> 05:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
there were to be another 2008 style
 
05:09:41.208 --> 05:09:41.218 align:start position:0%
housing crash Banks would be desperate
 
05:09:42.830 --> 05:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
to make up their money making it
 
05:09:44.510 --> 05:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
extremely convenient for companies like
 
05:09:47.390 --> 05:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
BlackRock to swoop in overbid take the
 
05:09:49.310 --> 05:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
homes and rent them forever
 
05:09:50.868 --> 05:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
when New Hampshire makes the save our
 
05:09:53.390 --> 05:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
homes Act of 2023 the law of the land we
 
05:09:54.948 --> 05:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
will be saying loudly and firmly that we
 
05:09:56.750 --> 05:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
prioritize real people over corporations
 
05:09:58.970 --> 05:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
and we believe in a New Hampshire and in
 
05:10:00.948 --> 05:10:00.958 align:start position:0%
America where home ownership is a
 
05:10:02.930 --> 05:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
reality and that the American dream May
 
05:10:05.208 --> 05:10:05.218 align:start position:0%
so endure for another generation
 
05:10:06.830 --> 05:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
so that is this legislation on the
 
05:10:08.330 --> 05:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
cosmic level I would encourage the
 
05:10:09.410 --> 05:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
committee to move it to the house
 
05:10:11.330 --> 05:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
Florida to pass or with an amendment if
 
05:10:13.010 --> 05:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
you see fit and I'm happy to take any
 
05:10:16.730 --> 05:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this Witness
 
05:10:18.770 --> 05:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
I don't see any I guess I have only one
 
05:10:20.750 --> 05:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
question sir have you given any thought
 
05:10:24.350 --> 05:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
to the issue of weather if I mean if we
 
05:10:25.850 --> 05:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
were to pass this it would be
 
05:10:28.310 --> 05:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional to say basically
 
05:10:31.610 --> 05:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
corporations who are citizens can't own
 
05:10:31.620 --> 05:10:33.410 align:start position:0%
corporations who are citizens can't own
property

05:10:33.410 --> 05:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:10:37.190 --> 05:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
I I I I I would struggle to
 
05:10:37.200 --> 05:10:38.330 align:start position:0%
I I I I I would struggle to
um

05:10:38.330 --> 05:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:40.430 --> 05:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
argue constitutional merits with the
 
05:10:42.230 --> 05:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
chair given your background
 
05:10:44.628 --> 05:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
um but what what I would say to that is
 
05:10:46.368 --> 05:10:46.378 align:start position:0%
as I thought of that
 
05:10:46.378 --> 05:10:47.208 align:start position:0%
as I thought of that
um

05:10:47.208 --> 05:10:47.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:49.330 --> 05:10:49.340 align:start position:0%
when making
 
05:10:52.128 --> 05:10:52.138 align:start position:0%
constitutional arguments you are able to
 
05:10:55.190 --> 05:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
call them whether or not something is a
 
05:10:57.590 --> 05:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
um public policy priority
 
05:11:00.830 --> 05:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
um and I would say like based on the
 
05:11:02.150 --> 05:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
scope of the issue that we're dealing
 
05:11:04.310 --> 05:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
with which I believe is in essence the
 
05:11:05.990 --> 05:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
American dream
 
05:11:07.788 --> 05:11:07.798 align:start position:0%
um that a court would find it
 
05:11:07.798 --> 05:11:09.410 align:start position:0%
um that a court would find it
constitutional

05:11:09.410 --> 05:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
05:11:11.390 --> 05:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
um based on those kind of broader public
 
05:11:14.448 --> 05:11:14.458 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you other questions
 
05:11:16.788 --> 05:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
representative Devine
 
05:11:18.830 --> 05:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:11:20.510 --> 05:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:11:22.850 --> 05:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
um when you're referring to like Airbnb
 
05:11:24.650 --> 05:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
properties you know like you have a
 
05:11:26.628 --> 05:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
house it has you know maybe three
 
05:11:29.708 --> 05:11:29.718 align:start position:0%
bedrooms it has bunk beds in one room
 
05:11:32.510 --> 05:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
you know it's all set up for somebody to
 
05:11:34.730 --> 05:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
come and rent especially up in say you
 
05:11:36.708 --> 05:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
know the Lakes Region of this or by the
 
05:11:38.868 --> 05:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
ocean somewhere how do you think this
 
05:11:42.470 --> 05:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
bill is going to affect that you you had
 
05:11:44.030 --> 05:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned Airbnb and I'm not I'm not
 
05:11:46.490 --> 05:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
sure I can follow you on that so so I
 
05:11:48.050 --> 05:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
just I didn't want to break the quote in
 
05:11:49.970 --> 05:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
that article so that's the only reason
 
05:11:51.590 --> 05:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
why those words were in there because
 
05:11:54.770 --> 05:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
the quote from the article is
 
05:11:57.530 --> 05:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
um all told yada yada yada a quarter of
 
05:11:58.970 --> 05:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
single-family Household Sales went to
 
05:12:01.010 --> 05:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
landlords really I could have cut it off
 
05:12:02.930 --> 05:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
there but I just wrote the rest of that
 
05:12:04.850 --> 05:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
in their aspiring airbn tycoons and
 
05:12:06.708 --> 05:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
other types of investors all told nearly
 
05:12:07.910 --> 05:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
a third of American house sales last
 
05:12:09.530 --> 05:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
year so that was the only reason why
 
05:12:11.330 --> 05:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
that little snippet was in there just to
 
05:12:13.010 --> 05:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
get that whole Atlantic article into
 
05:12:14.690 --> 05:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
quote uh without having to break that
 
05:12:16.310 --> 05:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't really apply to this okay
 
05:12:18.410 --> 05:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
I have a
 
05:12:20.750 --> 05:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
um so how would this affect like you
 
05:12:22.670 --> 05:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
know property management companies who
 
05:12:24.890 --> 05:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
are taking care of maybe
 
05:12:26.570 --> 05:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
um second-hand homes that are being
 
05:12:28.610 --> 05:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
rented out
 
05:12:30.350 --> 05:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
um in this state how would this Bill
 
05:12:32.510 --> 05:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
affect that
 
05:12:34.430 --> 05:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
property management companies well if
 
05:12:36.230 --> 05:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
they're only maintaining it they're not
 
05:12:37.910 --> 05:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
owning it then that would be a separate
 
05:12:41.270 --> 05:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
distinction uh well if they do own it
 
05:12:45.288 --> 05:12:45.298 align:start position:0%
well then I mean if it's ownership then
 
05:12:47.208 --> 05:12:47.218 align:start position:0%
if they're if they're currently owning
 
05:12:49.910 --> 05:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
it its grandfathered provided that the
 
05:12:52.490 --> 05:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
next buyer of that home is a natural
 
05:12:55.910 --> 05:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
person but the point here and I this
 
05:12:57.948 --> 05:12:57.958 align:start position:0%
bill was a long formula process there
 
05:12:59.810 --> 05:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
were a bunch of us that met last year in
 
05:13:01.128 --> 05:13:01.138 align:start position:0%
order to try to find a way around this
 
05:13:03.590 --> 05:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
and the problem that we ran into with
 
05:13:05.810 --> 05:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
situations like that is why I haven't
 
05:13:08.628 --> 05:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
hear you know the LLC
 
05:13:11.270 --> 05:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
um or the conglomerate pretending to be
 
05:13:14.330 --> 05:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
an LLC like if if you really try to
 
05:13:16.490 --> 05:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
narrow cast exceptions that far down
 
05:13:18.410 --> 05:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
then you're gonna create more
 
05:13:20.690 --> 05:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
opportunities where the bill is
 
05:13:22.430 --> 05:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
essentially swiss cheese like there are
 
05:13:23.510 --> 05:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
so many holes in it that it doesn't
 
05:13:25.550 --> 05:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
really match up
 
05:13:28.190 --> 05:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
um so that's that issue there
 
05:13:30.470 --> 05:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
05:13:33.288 --> 05:13:33.298 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative Tripp oh I'm
 
05:13:34.850 --> 05:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm sorry I'll get you I'll get to
 
05:13:36.590 --> 05:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
you next representative representative
 
05:13:36.600 --> 05:13:38.208 align:start position:0%
you next representative representative
Tripp

05:13:38.208 --> 05:13:38.218 align:start position:0%
Tripp
 
05:13:40.250 --> 05:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
05:13:43.250 --> 05:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
05:13:47.570 --> 05:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
I the bill is basically to prevent uh
 
05:13:50.270 --> 05:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
corporations from buying uh buying up
 
05:13:53.868 --> 05:13:53.878 align:start position:0%
homes is that correct yes uh
 
05:13:56.390 --> 05:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
is an aspiring short-term rental Tycoon
 
05:14:01.070 --> 05:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
it's probably a family are they uh
 
05:14:01.080 --> 05:14:03.230 align:start position:0%
it's probably a family are they uh
Corporation

05:14:03.230 --> 05:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
Corporation
 
05:14:05.628 --> 05:14:05.638 align:start position:0%
is a family Incorporation
 
05:14:05.638 --> 05:14:06.948 align:start position:0%
is a family Incorporation
yeah

05:14:06.948 --> 05:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:14:10.490 --> 05:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
no so would this bill prevent a family
 
05:14:12.708 --> 05:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
from buying two or three houses
 
05:14:15.230 --> 05:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
for uh no because they would be
 
05:14:17.628 --> 05:14:17.638 align:start position:0%
considered a natural persons
 
05:14:20.270 --> 05:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
under the definition
 
05:14:24.110 --> 05:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
I I think I'm confused by the question
 
05:14:25.430 --> 05:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
well I
 
05:14:27.170 --> 05:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to clarify you know what
 
05:14:27.180 --> 05:14:28.190 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to clarify you know what
is

05:14:28.190 --> 05:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:14:31.310 --> 05:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
you know if if a family is is looking to
 
05:14:35.330 --> 05:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
to build a company you know by buying up
 
05:14:38.750 --> 05:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
homes and renting them out you know does
 
05:14:40.970 --> 05:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
does that qualify them as a company or
 
05:14:43.190 --> 05:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
as a family if they did it under an LLC
 
05:14:46.310 --> 05:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:48.050 --> 05:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
Mr chair while I have the opportunity
 
05:14:49.550 --> 05:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
can I provide a little context as to
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
where some of this language came from
 
05:14:54.350 --> 05:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
sure so uh there was legislation
 
05:14:56.270 --> 05:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
um that this is largely modeled off of
 
05:14:58.128 --> 05:14:58.138 align:start position:0%
that came out of Iowa
 
05:15:00.948 --> 05:15:00.958 align:start position:0%
um that intended to stop
 
05:15:03.590 --> 05:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
um International corporate entities from
 
05:15:05.270 --> 05:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
purchasing homes you have a lot of
 
05:15:07.910 --> 05:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
problems in cities like New York and San
 
05:15:09.110 --> 05:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
Francisco and other High real estate
 
05:15:12.350 --> 05:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
areas where foreign Nationals
 
05:15:14.810 --> 05:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
um are just buying a property and
 
05:15:16.490 --> 05:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
they're not owned by Americans they're
 
05:15:16.500 --> 05:15:17.690 align:start position:0%
they're not owned by Americans they're
not

05:15:17.690 --> 05:15:17.700 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:15:17.700 --> 05:15:18.610 align:start position:0%
not
um

05:15:18.610 --> 05:15:18.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:21.770 --> 05:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
they're not owned by American entities
 
05:15:23.090 --> 05:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
um so that's where a lot of this
 
05:15:24.650 --> 05:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
language came from this wasn't just us
 
05:15:26.150 --> 05:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
kind of freewheeling it
 
05:15:28.070 --> 05:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
um we did pull it from there with some
 
05:15:29.868 --> 05:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
obvious uh changes
 
05:15:30.830 --> 05:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
um but that's sort of the background
 
05:15:32.868 --> 05:15:32.878 align:start position:0%
here uh natural persons was defined in
 
05:15:34.730 --> 05:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
that statute uh and we would be looking
 
05:15:36.288 --> 05:15:36.298 align:start position:0%
to carry that over here all right
 
05:15:37.850 --> 05:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
representative Turner you had a question
 
05:15:41.990 --> 05:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh I do thanks Mr chairman uh thanks
 
05:15:43.368 --> 05:15:43.378 align:start position:0%
um for taking questions
 
05:15:46.850 --> 05:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
um I guess my question relates to sort
 
05:15:49.190 --> 05:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
of the presence of the home versus the
 
05:15:51.470 --> 05:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
sort of livability of the home in my
 
05:15:54.890 --> 05:15:54.900 align:start position:0%
town we have Route 125 which is you know
 
05:15:57.050 --> 05:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
rapidly becoming a highway but it also
 
05:15:58.970 --> 05:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
has many residential homes and many of
 
05:16:02.030 --> 05:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
those that are on that road are
 
05:16:04.070 --> 05:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know have an old home on it that's
 
05:16:06.288 --> 05:16:06.298 align:start position:0%
clearly not being used anymore and
 
05:16:09.230 --> 05:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
someone is holding that property waiting
 
05:16:11.930 --> 05:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
for you know conditions to be right to
 
05:16:14.930 --> 05:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
develop it most likely as you know uh
 
05:16:17.510 --> 05:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
retail or or some sort of corporate
 
05:16:20.030 --> 05:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
space What would this do in that in in
 
05:16:23.208 --> 05:16:23.218 align:start position:0%
the case of of a property that has a
 
05:16:25.810 --> 05:16:25.820 align:start position:0%
home on it but that home is really not
 
05:16:30.590 --> 05:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:33.708 --> 05:16:33.718 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that well it's no longer
 
05:16:35.990 --> 05:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
occupiable I'm not sure that they would
 
05:16:37.730 --> 05:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
be able to sell it
 
05:16:37.740 --> 05:16:38.810 align:start position:0%
be able to sell it
um

05:16:38.810 --> 05:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:41.448 --> 05:16:41.458 align:start position:0%
trying to find we are in the legislation
 
05:16:43.010 --> 05:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
I mean as as far as it pertains to
 
05:16:44.868 --> 05:16:44.878 align:start position:0%
development we do have
 
05:16:46.970 --> 05:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
um one of the exceptions in here being a
 
05:16:48.770 --> 05:16:48.780 align:start position:0%
development Clause
 
05:16:50.750 --> 05:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
um so companies would be able to
 
05:16:52.190 --> 05:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
purchase purchase those provided that
 
05:16:53.270 --> 05:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
they register with the Secretary of
 
05:16:53.280 --> 05:16:54.470 align:start position:0%
they register with the Secretary of
State

05:16:54.470 --> 05:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
State
 
05:16:55.910 --> 05:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
um and that they're sold within two
 
05:16:55.920 --> 05:16:57.288 align:start position:0%
um and that they're sold within two
years

05:16:57.288 --> 05:16:57.298 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:16:57.298 --> 05:16:58.190 align:start position:0%
years
um

05:16:58.190 --> 05:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:01.208 --> 05:17:01.218 align:start position:0%
but as far as just a random property
 
05:17:03.170 --> 05:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
could you pay me a little bit of a
 
05:17:03.180 --> 05:17:04.490 align:start position:0%
could you pay me a little bit of a
picture

05:17:04.490 --> 05:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
picture
 
05:17:06.650 --> 05:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
um as far as it's like a property on the
 
05:17:06.660 --> 05:17:07.610 align:start position:0%
um as far as it's like a property on the
backyard

05:17:07.610 --> 05:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
backyard
 
05:17:10.430 --> 05:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
now that this is a you know a property
 
05:17:13.430 --> 05:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
along a busy highway what's now I
 
05:17:16.070 --> 05:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
consider a highway you know and it used
 
05:17:18.050 --> 05:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
to obviously be a much smaller road that
 
05:17:20.270 --> 05:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
has you know single-family home sitting
 
05:17:23.750 --> 05:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
on it that home is no longer occupied or
 
05:17:25.670 --> 05:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
occupyable I guess
 
05:17:28.550 --> 05:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
um and someone is holding that property
 
05:17:30.650 --> 05:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
probably for more than two years waiting
 
05:17:33.830 --> 05:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
for conditions to be right to develop it
 
05:17:36.590 --> 05:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
into something this seems like it might
 
05:17:40.010 --> 05:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
preclude that and I'm not sure in that
 
05:17:41.930 --> 05:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
situation whether the goal of sort of
 
05:17:44.570 --> 05:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
preserving the the transfer of housing
 
05:17:47.090 --> 05:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
or development of property I wasn't sure
 
05:17:48.410 --> 05:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
how it would affect that because I think
 
05:17:49.550 --> 05:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
it might there might be a number of
 
05:17:51.170 --> 05:17:51.180 align:start position:0%
properties around the state that look
 
05:17:53.150 --> 05:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
like that yeah I hadn't considered a
 
05:17:54.650 --> 05:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
situation like that
 
05:17:55.910 --> 05:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:17:58.910 --> 05:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
um I could get back to you on that other
 
05:17:59.930 --> 05:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
 
05:18:02.090 --> 05:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
 
05:18:04.788 --> 05:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
um yes so how does this uh
 
05:18:06.948 --> 05:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
he said this bill protects trust so how
 
05:18:09.190 --> 05:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
does it protect uh
 
05:18:11.810 --> 05:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
individuals and families who have their
 
05:18:14.390 --> 05:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
real estate and you know a revocable or
 
05:18:17.090 --> 05:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
irrevocable trust and
 
05:18:18.910 --> 05:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
I'm looking
 
05:18:21.770 --> 05:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
where in here we wrote the line that
 
05:18:23.570 --> 05:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
says nothing in this section is to be
 
05:18:26.810 --> 05:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
concerned to alter trust in any way okay
 
05:18:29.270 --> 05:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
um that was about the language but I'm
 
05:18:30.650 --> 05:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
trying to find this specific line you
 
05:18:31.910 --> 05:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
guys saw that yeah
 
05:18:35.090 --> 05:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
uh should be under exceptions in the
 
05:18:38.390 --> 05:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:42.410 --> 05:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I say yep yep and uh
 
05:18:45.110 --> 05:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
follow a question and maybe this is an
 
05:18:47.030 --> 05:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
unavoidable consequence of it but well
 
05:18:48.550 --> 05:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire we're often
 
05:18:51.410 --> 05:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
obsessing making tax policy that
 
05:18:53.868 --> 05:18:53.878 align:start position:0%
attracts rich people from out of state
 
05:18:56.510 --> 05:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
um one of the things rich people like to
 
05:18:58.610 --> 05:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
do is you know put their
 
05:19:00.708 --> 05:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
property you know under an anonymous
 
05:19:02.690 --> 05:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
entity so you don't know exactly who
 
05:19:04.670 --> 05:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
owns the property so is there a question
 
05:19:06.770 --> 05:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
here yes so is that is that still
 
05:19:08.810 --> 05:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
possible or is that actually probably or
 
05:19:12.170 --> 05:19:12.180 align:start position:0%
is that something that's uh forbidden by
 
05:19:13.730 --> 05:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
the language of the bills and perhaps
 
05:19:13.740 --> 05:19:15.830 align:start position:0%
the language of the bills and perhaps
deliberately

05:19:15.830 --> 05:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
deliberately
 
05:19:17.570 --> 05:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
I don't think it really was deliberate
 
05:19:19.430 --> 05:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
I'll just kind of I'd like to re-center
 
05:19:20.750 --> 05:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
the conversation a little bit and just
 
05:19:23.390 --> 05:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
say like the the overarching goal of
 
05:19:25.510 --> 05:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation was to stop
 
05:19:28.070 --> 05:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
consolidation uh within the housing
 
05:19:28.080 --> 05:19:29.150 align:start position:0%
consolidation uh within the housing
market

05:19:29.150 --> 05:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
market
 
05:19:30.770 --> 05:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
um under a few
 
05:19:32.270 --> 05:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
um corporate conglomerates there have
 
05:19:33.230 --> 05:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
been a lot of stories over the last
 
05:19:38.150 --> 05:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
couple years of 25 30 45 percent of
 
05:19:40.250 --> 05:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
communities uh especially in the trailer
 
05:19:42.410 --> 05:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
home Market uh just being owned by the
 
05:19:43.610 --> 05:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
same company
 
05:19:46.550 --> 05:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
um and when you talk about an issue like
 
05:19:48.830 --> 05:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
inflation yes there's the monetary side
 
05:19:50.390 --> 05:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
of inflation but there are also specific
 
05:19:51.948 --> 05:19:51.958 align:start position:0%
points in the market where inflation is
 
05:19:54.350 --> 05:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
worse and one of those is housing
 
05:19:56.030 --> 05:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
um so it's an effort to go after that
 
05:19:58.190 --> 05:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
it's an effort to make sure that you
 
05:20:00.110 --> 05:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
know the next generation of Americans
 
05:20:01.910 --> 05:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to own a home and
 
05:20:04.250 --> 05:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
build that kind of equity so that's
 
05:20:05.810 --> 05:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
really the overarching purpose of this
 
05:20:07.550 --> 05:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm open Nanny
 
05:20:08.868 --> 05:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
um amendments that the committee May
 
05:20:10.190 --> 05:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
deem necessary in order to make that
 
05:20:11.930 --> 05:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
work but I would hope
 
05:20:14.750 --> 05:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
um that on that higher level uh that's
 
05:20:16.610 --> 05:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
an agreeable position all right other
 
05:20:18.590 --> 05:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
05:20:22.490 --> 05:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:36.070 --> 05:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:38.810 --> 05:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Brandon Lemay uh from
 
05:20:40.250 --> 05:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire representing
 
05:20:43.010 --> 05:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
myself here uh and I'm here to speak in
 
05:20:45.650 --> 05:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
favor of 340 here
 
05:20:49.190 --> 05:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh and I just want to say uh that in my
 
05:20:51.350 --> 05:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
experience working with low and middle
 
05:20:53.330 --> 05:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
income tenants some of the most
 
05:20:54.890 --> 05:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
problematic landlords that we've had
 
05:20:57.708 --> 05:20:57.718 align:start position:0%
have been corporate landlords from out
 
05:20:58.670 --> 05:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
of state
 
05:21:00.410 --> 05:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh particularly they are going after
 
05:21:03.650 --> 05:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
multi-family homes as a means uh because
 
05:21:05.628 --> 05:21:05.638 align:start position:0%
they tend to have a lot of potential
 
05:21:06.948 --> 05:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
rental income
 
05:21:10.010 --> 05:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
and these corporate landlords are
 
05:21:12.530 --> 05:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
pushing out the more Ma and PAW
 
05:21:15.050 --> 05:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
landlords who have to look their tenants
 
05:21:17.830 --> 05:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
in the face every single day
 
05:21:22.610 --> 05:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
and this is irreversibly uh changing the
 
05:21:24.110 --> 05:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
character of the neighborhoods in
 
05:21:26.690 --> 05:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
Manchester because we are having
 
05:21:29.270 --> 05:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
corporations by these buildings and
 
05:21:31.368 --> 05:21:31.378 align:start position:0%
they're not owned by real people and as
 
05:21:33.230 --> 05:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
a result we have tenants that stay for
 
05:21:35.750 --> 05:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
only two years at a time so it's my
 
05:21:38.990 --> 05:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
opinion that house bill 340 would be
 
05:21:40.368 --> 05:21:40.378 align:start position:0%
able to make sure that low and middle
 
05:21:42.530 --> 05:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
income tenants aren't competing with out
 
05:21:45.590 --> 05:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
of State Corporations to buy property
 
05:21:47.750 --> 05:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
for their own one day I'll keep it
 
05:21:49.430 --> 05:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
really short but I'll open up the
 
05:21:49.440 --> 05:21:50.270 align:start position:0%
really short but I'll open up the
questions

05:21:50.270 --> 05:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:21:52.730 --> 05:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
05:21:54.490 --> 05:21:54.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir thank you
 
05:21:57.830 --> 05:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh uh Alexandria Murray
 
05:21:57.840 --> 05:22:04.910 align:start position:0%
representative uh uh Alexandria Murray
please

05:22:04.910 --> 05:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:06.770 --> 05:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you to the
 
05:22:08.750 --> 05:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
committee for welcoming me today
 
05:22:10.910 --> 05:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
um my name is representative Alessandra
 
05:22:13.970 --> 05:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
Murray I represent Manchester Ward 9. I
 
05:22:15.170 --> 05:22:15.180 align:start position:0%
actually just wanted to share a little
 
05:22:16.850 --> 05:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
bit about like my personal experience
 
05:22:18.110 --> 05:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
with this
 
05:22:21.288 --> 05:22:21.298 align:start position:0%
um last in 2019
 
05:22:23.390 --> 05:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
um the landlord that for the apartment
 
05:22:25.610 --> 05:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
that my fiance and I were living in let
 
05:22:26.628 --> 05:22:26.638 align:start position:0%
us know that he was going to be
 
05:22:29.330 --> 05:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
renovating and we needed to move out and
 
05:22:31.910 --> 05:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
rent is so high in Manchester that it's
 
05:22:33.530 --> 05:22:33.540 align:start position:0%
about the same as paying a mortgage so
 
05:22:35.150 --> 05:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
my fiance and I were like we should look
 
05:22:36.948 --> 05:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
for a house
 
05:22:39.230 --> 05:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
um we spent months looking for a house
 
05:22:41.030 --> 05:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
in Manchester he's lived there his
 
05:22:42.830 --> 05:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
entire life I've lived there my entire
 
05:22:44.810 --> 05:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
adult life we were literally the example
 
05:22:47.330 --> 05:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
of like a young couple trying to stay in
 
05:22:48.948 --> 05:22:48.958 align:start position:0%
the area that we grew up and lived in
 
05:22:51.288 --> 05:22:51.298 align:start position:0%
and couldn't find a house that could
 
05:22:53.810 --> 05:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
meet our needs um because we kept
 
05:22:55.850 --> 05:22:55.860 align:start position:0%
getting outbid by out-of-state
 
05:22:57.948 --> 05:22:57.958 align:start position:0%
corporations there was one instance
 
05:23:00.110 --> 05:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
where we put an offer on a house and we
 
05:23:01.730 --> 05:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
are outbid by a hundred thousand dollars
 
05:23:04.190 --> 05:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
when we had already bid 20 000 over the
 
05:23:06.350 --> 05:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
asking price and within a week that
 
05:23:08.628 --> 05:23:08.638 align:start position:0%
house was up on Craigslist available for
 
05:23:11.390 --> 05:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
rent so it was extremely discouraging to
 
05:23:13.250 --> 05:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
be a young person that is trying to stay
 
05:23:15.830 --> 05:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
in my home stay at my hometown
 
05:23:17.570 --> 05:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
um and feel like we're not wanted like
 
05:23:18.948 --> 05:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
there isn't space for the people that
 
05:23:21.410 --> 05:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
are already here and I think at this
 
05:23:23.208 --> 05:23:23.218 align:start position:0%
point when our housing crisis in New
 
05:23:25.970 --> 05:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is so bad that it makes sense
 
05:23:28.368 --> 05:23:28.378 align:start position:0%
to pass legislation like this because we
 
05:23:30.230 --> 05:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
frankly don't have housing despair to
 
05:23:32.208 --> 05:23:32.218 align:start position:0%
give to corporations for them to you
 
05:23:34.610 --> 05:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
know just Garner more profits we need to
 
05:23:35.868 --> 05:23:35.878 align:start position:0%
be able to house the people that already
 
05:23:37.490 --> 05:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
live here in the state and have been
 
05:23:39.470 --> 05:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
here for a long time but I just wanted
 
05:23:40.850 --> 05:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
to share my personal experience I'm not
 
05:23:42.590 --> 05:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor on the spell but you know
 
05:23:45.590 --> 05:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
it touches my circumstances so I'm open
 
05:23:46.970 --> 05:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
to questions if there are any questions
 
05:23:49.128 --> 05:23:49.138 align:start position:0%
for this Witness
 
05:23:50.930 --> 05:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
05:24:03.650 --> 05:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:05.150 --> 05:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
05:24:07.190 --> 05:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Chris Norwood I am
 
05:24:09.770 --> 05:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
the 2023 chair of the New Hampshire
 
05:24:11.868 --> 05:24:11.878 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors public policy
 
05:24:14.510 --> 05:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm a real estate broker
 
05:24:16.128 --> 05:24:16.138 align:start position:0%
and practitioner in the state of New
 
05:24:18.890 --> 05:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the Realtors are opposed to
 
05:24:23.810 --> 05:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
House Bill 340. uh specifically the two
 
05:24:26.470 --> 05:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
components of this bill are prohibiting
 
05:24:28.250 --> 05:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
corporations from purchasing
 
05:24:30.590 --> 05:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
single-family homes and multi-family
 
05:24:32.868 --> 05:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
homes I will say that there are cases
 
05:24:36.350 --> 05:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
albeit rare when an individual would
 
05:24:38.868 --> 05:24:38.878 align:start position:0%
request to purchase a home be it a
 
05:24:40.550 --> 05:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
primary home or a secondary residence
 
05:24:43.970 --> 05:24:43.980 align:start position:0%
within an LLC be it for liability or tax
 
05:24:46.070 --> 05:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
reasons and I would defer to their
 
05:24:47.810 --> 05:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
accountant and their attorney as to why
 
05:24:50.570 --> 05:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
that exception May and should exist in
 
05:24:53.448 --> 05:24:53.458 align:start position:0%
this uh as perhaps a carve out
 
05:24:55.850 --> 05:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
the other broader piece is
 
05:24:58.310 --> 05:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
um I I don't disagree with some of the
 
05:25:00.350 --> 05:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh challenges in the market currently I
 
05:25:01.970 --> 05:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
think the Realtors broadly would say we
 
05:25:04.430 --> 05:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
need more Supply by by artificially
 
05:25:07.250 --> 05:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the transfer of property I
 
05:25:09.530 --> 05:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
do think that that's going to do more to
 
05:25:12.490 --> 05:25:12.500 align:start position:0%
damage the uh the real estate market
 
05:25:14.628 --> 05:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
specifically in the multi-family
 
05:25:16.850 --> 05:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
development Arena a lot of the the
 
05:25:19.850 --> 05:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
larger complexes whether or not we
 
05:25:21.948 --> 05:25:21.958 align:start position:0%
want to see them in our communities but
 
05:25:24.050 --> 05:25:24.060 align:start position:0%
these larger complexes that are doing a
 
05:25:25.750 --> 05:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
lot of good in terms of adding Supply
 
05:25:28.730 --> 05:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
are only feasible to have a large
 
05:25:31.368 --> 05:25:31.378 align:start position:0%
corporation do that be that an in-state
 
05:25:32.750 --> 05:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
Corporation or an out-of-state
 
05:25:35.510 --> 05:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
Corporation a lot of times the way that
 
05:25:38.090 --> 05:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
those get done is there's a conglomerate
 
05:25:40.310 --> 05:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
of individuals that are put together by
 
05:25:43.190 --> 05:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
either an LLC or some sort of Syndicate
 
05:25:45.470 --> 05:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
where there's a lot of equity being
 
05:25:47.750 --> 05:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
raised and to put that on the burden of
 
05:25:50.510 --> 05:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
one person as an individual to create a
 
05:25:53.448 --> 05:25:53.458 align:start position:0%
10 20 or 30 million dollar 80 unit
 
05:25:56.208 --> 05:25:56.218 align:start position:0%
apartment building is I don't believe is
 
05:25:58.250 --> 05:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
feasible and I understand the carve out
 
05:26:01.010 --> 05:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
on development where it says yes you can
 
05:26:03.288 --> 05:26:03.298 align:start position:0%
raise all that capital and have a
 
05:26:05.570 --> 05:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
corporation but then there's a window by
 
05:26:06.948 --> 05:26:06.958 align:start position:0%
which that property has to be
 
05:26:09.410 --> 05:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
transferred to an individual and I just
 
05:26:10.788 --> 05:26:10.798 align:start position:0%
don't think that that is practical in
 
05:26:12.830 --> 05:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
the market to say that individuals are
 
05:26:14.990 --> 05:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
the only uh entities that can own
 
05:26:17.868 --> 05:26:17.878 align:start position:0%
multi-family housing it's just the
 
05:26:19.368 --> 05:26:19.378 align:start position:0%
nature of the Beast that you need to
 
05:26:19.378 --> 05:26:20.628 align:start position:0%
nature of the Beast that you need to
have

05:26:20.628 --> 05:26:20.638 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:26:23.690 --> 05:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
um you need to have cash and Equity from
 
05:26:25.670 --> 05:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
a number of different sources to
 
05:26:28.070 --> 05:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
undertake these larger developments so
 
05:26:29.868 --> 05:26:29.878 align:start position:0%
uh the only other piece that I'd like to
 
05:26:31.850 --> 05:26:31.860 align:start position:0%
offer that's a little bit of a a
 
05:26:34.670 --> 05:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
different piece of testimony here is uh
 
05:26:36.530 --> 05:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
the National Association of Realtors did
 
05:26:40.070 --> 05:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
does have a a survey where they took a
 
05:26:41.930 --> 05:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
look at specifically institutional
 
05:26:44.090 --> 05:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
buyers of residential homes so this is
 
05:26:47.930 --> 05:26:47.940 align:start position:0%
on the single family side in 2021 and
 
05:26:50.330 --> 05:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
I'll share this with everybody out of
 
05:26:53.750 --> 05:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
all 50 states Vermont did not for
 
05:26:55.730 --> 05:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
whatever reason did not register any
 
05:26:59.628 --> 05:26:59.638 align:start position:0%
data so let's take it out of 49 states
 
05:27:03.708 --> 05:27:03.718 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire had four percent of all
 
05:27:07.910 --> 05:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
their residential home purchases uh as a
 
05:27:10.550 --> 05:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
institutional buyer and I think where a
 
05:27:12.410 --> 05:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
lot of the data is coming from is from
 
05:27:13.850 --> 05:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
the south particularly the you know
 
05:27:16.610 --> 05:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
Texas where the transactions of
 
05:27:19.128 --> 05:27:19.138 align:start position:0%
institutional buyers exceed 20 percent
 
05:27:22.010 --> 05:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh I know New England the worst state if
 
05:27:24.050 --> 05:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
if I recall
 
05:27:27.650 --> 05:27:27.660 align:start position:0%
um is Rhode Island but again we are very
 
05:27:29.990 --> 05:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
very low in terms of having the
 
05:27:32.390 --> 05:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
so-called institutional buyers coming in
 
05:27:34.250 --> 05:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
and buying our inventory and I'll leave
 
05:27:36.948 --> 05:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
this map with uh with you representative
 
05:27:39.050 --> 05:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
if you could hand that out and I'm happy
 
05:27:41.150 --> 05:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
to take any questions questions for this
 
05:27:41.160 --> 05:27:42.948 align:start position:0%
to take any questions questions for this

05:28:11.030 --> 05:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
to this bill uh I don't spend a lot of
 
05:28:12.530 --> 05:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
time in front of this committee so just
 
05:28:14.510 --> 05:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
to give you an opportunity to learn
 
05:28:17.030 --> 05:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
about the association all 10 members or
 
05:28:18.650 --> 05:28:18.660 align:start position:0%
all 10 counties are members of the
 
05:28:20.330 --> 05:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
association and that includes your
 
05:28:24.110 --> 05:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioners your County uh attorneys
 
05:28:26.330 --> 05:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
register of deeds and all of your
 
05:28:29.570 --> 05:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
appointed and elected officials so uh we
 
05:28:32.390 --> 05:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
did review this bill we do have major
 
05:28:34.310 --> 05:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
concerns one being that the chairman
 
05:28:35.750 --> 05:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
already pointed out about the
 
05:28:38.448 --> 05:28:38.458 align:start position:0%
Constitutional uh
 
05:28:41.990 --> 05:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
ability of this bill and it what our
 
05:28:44.570 --> 05:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
review says is that this will not pass
 
05:28:47.570 --> 05:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional test also there are
 
05:28:49.850 --> 05:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
very big concerns from your register of
 
05:28:52.970 --> 05:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
deeds offices about the confusion and
 
05:28:54.830 --> 05:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
delays that this could cause at the
 
05:28:58.070 --> 05:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
Deeds office specifically around
 
05:29:02.990 --> 05:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
um RSA 647 colon 46 2 that allows the
 
05:29:05.750 --> 05:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
two per year period for a non-natural
 
05:29:09.170 --> 05:29:09.180 align:start position:0%
developer to relinquish property uh
 
05:29:11.270 --> 05:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
unless they prove that they have the
 
05:29:13.128 --> 05:29:13.138 align:start position:0%
property for sale and on the market for
 
05:29:14.990 --> 05:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
the perceiving 12-month period that
 
05:29:16.788 --> 05:29:16.798 align:start position:0%
could cause major delays at your
 
05:29:19.190 --> 05:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
Register of Deeds office and your
 
05:29:20.990 --> 05:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
registers of Deeds did reach out to me
 
05:29:24.050 --> 05:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
to highlight that I am happy to take any
 
05:29:26.990 --> 05:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
questions but overall the association
 
05:29:28.550 --> 05:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
feels that this is going to hinder the
 
05:29:30.350 --> 05:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
housing market in New Hampshire and not
 
05:29:31.550 --> 05:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
increase it
 
05:29:34.490 --> 05:29:34.500 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
05:29:36.948 --> 05:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you uh Nick
 
05:29:40.670 --> 05:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:42.770 --> 05:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman for
 
05:29:45.230 --> 05:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
another opportunity to speak
 
05:29:48.288 --> 05:29:48.298 align:start position:0%
again I advocate for landlord property
 
05:29:50.390 --> 05:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
owners and we are
 
05:29:53.030 --> 05:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
against this bill
 
05:29:56.868 --> 05:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
uh to me it doesn't make any sense
 
05:29:58.490 --> 05:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
first of all a natural person is not
 
05:30:01.368 --> 05:30:01.378 align:start position:0%
defined anywhere in this bill to my
 
05:30:01.378 --> 05:30:02.628 align:start position:0%
defined anywhere in this bill to my
knowledge

05:30:02.628 --> 05:30:02.638 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
05:30:02.638 --> 05:30:04.670 align:start position:0%
knowledge
is

05:30:04.670 --> 05:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:30:07.850 --> 05:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
been the situation that for many many
 
05:30:07.860 --> 05:30:09.590 align:start position:0%
been the situation that for many many
reasons

05:30:09.590 --> 05:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
05:30:12.890 --> 05:30:12.900 align:start position:0%
you may want to have a corporation or an
 
05:30:15.708 --> 05:30:15.718 align:start position:0%
LLC or some kind of a partnership a
 
05:30:16.970 --> 05:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
general partnership a limited
 
05:30:19.010 --> 05:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
partnership many different forms of
 
05:30:20.990 --> 05:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
ownerships corporations C corporations
 
05:30:24.070 --> 05:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
as corporations to own property
 
05:30:28.070 --> 05:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
if you're making something this large
 
05:30:29.868 --> 05:30:29.878 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any sense for an
 
05:30:32.330 --> 05:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
individual person and this day and time
 
05:30:34.550 --> 05:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
to be taking on personal liability and
 
05:30:36.708 --> 05:30:36.718 align:start position:0%
signing for personal guarantees on loans
 
05:30:38.990 --> 05:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
for a large development of multi-family
 
05:30:42.948 --> 05:30:42.958 align:start position:0%
housing and we don't need to discourage
 
05:30:46.310 --> 05:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
investors from creating more housing
 
05:30:49.970 --> 05:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what we don't need
 
05:30:53.390 --> 05:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
so this bill would discourage investors
 
05:30:55.670 --> 05:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
from investing in New Hampshire I'm very
 
05:30:57.410 --> 05:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
concerned about that I mean who who
 
05:30:59.990 --> 05:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
would who would invest in in a large way
 
05:31:01.490 --> 05:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire if they can't set up
 
05:31:04.310 --> 05:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
the legal structures that are common to
 
05:31:07.310 --> 05:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
own real estate not only for owning the
 
05:31:09.830 --> 05:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
real estate and protecting the asset but
 
05:31:12.708 --> 05:31:12.718 align:start position:0%
just even for the estate planning right
 
05:31:16.868 --> 05:31:16.878 align:start position:0%
you have an LLC that has individual
 
05:31:20.750 --> 05:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
members and a manager and it's common
 
05:31:24.470 --> 05:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
it's in my situation in many is that you
 
05:31:27.708 --> 05:31:27.718 align:start position:0%
have a family LLC where the ownership
 
05:31:29.868 --> 05:31:29.878 align:start position:0%
interest of the individual members are
 
05:31:31.670 --> 05:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
passed down to the children over the
 
05:31:36.770 --> 05:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
years and then that does not end up in
 
05:31:40.368 --> 05:31:40.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:43.010 --> 05:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
Probate Court probate
 
05:31:45.288 --> 05:31:45.298 align:start position:0%
um and so now you've saved all of those
 
05:31:47.990 --> 05:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
probate fees and inheritance fees and so
 
05:31:49.610 --> 05:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
forth and so on there's many many
 
05:31:52.788 --> 05:31:52.798 align:start position:0%
reasons and whatever it is a couple
 
05:31:55.128 --> 05:31:55.138 align:start position:0%
hundred years of history of setting up
 
05:31:57.590 --> 05:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
corporate structures LLC structures and
 
05:31:59.270 --> 05:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
all the various reasons that that whole
 
05:32:01.670 --> 05:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
thing exists and Jesus will throw it out
 
05:32:03.470 --> 05:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense to me at all
 
05:32:07.490 --> 05:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:11.030 --> 05:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir
 
05:32:15.830 --> 05:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
05:32:19.490 --> 05:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
committee I know I'm one of the last
 
05:32:21.050 --> 05:32:21.060 align:start position:0%
speakers in a lot of what I was going to
 
05:32:21.060 --> 05:32:22.010 align:start position:0%
speakers in a lot of what I was going to
say

05:32:22.010 --> 05:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:32:23.390 --> 05:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
um other people have covered I'm going
 
05:32:25.610 --> 05:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
to try and skip it very quickly but I
 
05:32:26.690 --> 05:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
find this build the most
 
05:32:28.670 --> 05:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
anti-development bill that I've seen
 
05:32:31.610 --> 05:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
this legislative session
 
05:32:33.650 --> 05:32:33.660 align:start position:0%
um we all have heard how bad the
 
05:32:36.050 --> 05:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
shortage of how losing is we need more
 
05:32:39.650 --> 05:32:39.660 align:start position:0%
built we need big projects
 
05:32:42.170 --> 05:32:42.180 align:start position:0%
we met with a my son and I met with a
 
05:32:43.970 --> 05:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
contract to convert a third floor of a
 
05:32:45.770 --> 05:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
building we have that's four units add
 
05:32:48.050 --> 05:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
two more units he told us construction
 
05:32:50.690 --> 05:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
costs not land three hundred dollars per
 
05:32:53.690 --> 05:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
square foot at 850 square feet per
 
05:32:55.070 --> 05:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
apartment which is not a big apartment
 
05:32:57.530 --> 05:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
that's going to be 25 million dollars to
 
05:33:00.350 --> 05:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
build individuals do not have in general
 
05:33:03.410 --> 05:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
25 million dollars as the person from
 
05:33:05.628 --> 05:33:05.638 align:start position:0%
the the real estate person talked about
 
05:33:08.628 --> 05:33:08.638 align:start position:0%
earlier that you needed multiple
 
05:33:10.490 --> 05:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
investors you will need a corporate
 
05:33:12.350 --> 05:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
structure an LLC structure to put this
 
05:33:14.930 --> 05:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
together to put together a Consortium to
 
05:33:17.448 --> 05:33:17.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:20.750 --> 05:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
this legislature has recognized over the
 
05:33:22.490 --> 05:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
years that we should have corporations
 
05:33:24.230 --> 05:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
we have corporate bills we have limited
 
05:33:26.270 --> 05:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
partnership bills we have an LLC Bill
 
05:33:28.010 --> 05:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
and those will put in to attract
 
05:33:30.230 --> 05:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
businesses of all types to the state
 
05:33:33.770 --> 05:33:33.780 align:start position:0%
this bill goes exactly against that
 
05:33:36.770 --> 05:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
the in addition I have questions on the
 
05:33:38.570 --> 05:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of the bill too both
 
05:33:40.250 --> 05:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
into the Commerce Clause and other
 
05:33:40.260 --> 05:33:41.330 align:start position:0%
into the Commerce Clause and other
clauses

05:33:41.330 --> 05:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
clauses
 
05:33:44.330 --> 05:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the fiscal note the
 
05:33:45.830 --> 05:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
judicial branch even talks about
 
05:33:48.170 --> 05:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
potential litigation running up the
 
05:33:50.090 --> 05:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
costs of this bill although they put
 
05:33:52.610 --> 05:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
indeterminate so they the people who who
 
05:33:55.010 --> 05:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
helped with the fiscal note realized
 
05:33:56.030 --> 05:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
that it was going to be a lot of
 
05:33:56.040 --> 05:33:58.910 align:start position:0%
that it was going to be a lot of
litigation

05:33:58.910 --> 05:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:58.920 --> 05:33:59.750 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:33:59.750 --> 05:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:34:02.150 --> 05:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
I also look at the penalties they're
 
05:34:05.030 --> 05:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
pretty severe if someone doesn't follow
 
05:34:08.330 --> 05:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
it and I think it's a taking without
 
05:34:10.368 --> 05:34:10.378 align:start position:0%
just compensation which raises another
 
05:34:12.770 --> 05:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue
 
05:34:12.780 --> 05:34:14.390 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue
finally

05:34:14.390 --> 05:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
finally
 
05:34:16.190 --> 05:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
from my point of view you want to work
 
05:34:18.590 --> 05:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
around this bill and make it useless
 
05:34:20.208 --> 05:34:20.218 align:start position:0%
have a straw
 
05:34:21.830 --> 05:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
and I know the chairman knows what I'm
 
05:34:24.590 --> 05:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
referring to you find an individual be
 
05:34:26.628 --> 05:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
very happy for a certain sum a year to
 
05:34:28.610 --> 05:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
hold the real estate in his or her name
 
05:34:31.190 --> 05:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
have all sorts of documents that are not
 
05:34:33.830 --> 05:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
recorded Deeds whatever to transfer it
 
05:34:35.750 --> 05:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
out of that person's name
 
05:34:37.850 --> 05:34:37.860 align:start position:0%
have all management in the hands of some
 
05:34:39.830 --> 05:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
other person separate the beneficial
 
05:34:41.030 --> 05:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
interests from the ownership interest
 
05:34:43.310 --> 05:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
which is what trust documents do
 
05:34:45.530 --> 05:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
and you can negate the effects of the
 
05:34:47.390 --> 05:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
bill the bill is basically
 
05:34:49.970 --> 05:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
it's unconstitutional and useless in my
 
05:34:52.128 --> 05:34:52.138 align:start position:0%
mind and I would really say to the
 
05:34:54.050 --> 05:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
committee let's work on things to
 
05:34:55.970 --> 05:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
increase supply of housing we're not
 
05:34:57.410 --> 05:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
going to get out of this by decreasing
 
05:34:59.690 --> 05:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
it we've got to increase it and put our
 
05:35:01.550 --> 05:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
efforts there and not on a bill like
 
05:35:03.350 --> 05:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
this that won't help us all right thank
 
05:35:04.970 --> 05:35:04.980 align:start position:0%

to testify on HB 340.
 
05:35:18.110 --> 05:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
05:35:20.150 --> 05:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to close the hearing on HB
 
05:35:23.990 --> 05:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
340 and I before we turn to HB 379 I'm
 
05:35:25.970 --> 05:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
going to take a seventh inning stretch
 
05:35:37.610 --> 05:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:39.530 --> 05:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
it's really just
 
05:35:45.288 --> 05:35:45.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:46.610 --> 05:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
I guess we're going to take a short
 
05:35:46.620 --> 05:36:08.590 align:start position:0%
I guess we're going to take a short
break

05:36:08.590 --> 05:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:08.600 --> 05:36:10.550 align:start position:0%
 
is

05:36:10.550 --> 05:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:36:21.590 --> 05:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:39.470 --> 05:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:39.480 --> 05:36:41.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:36:41.270 --> 05:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:36:41.280 --> 05:37:44.708 align:start position:0%
okay
people

05:37:44.708 --> 05:37:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:13.010 --> 05:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:13.020 --> 05:38:44.390 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:38:44.390 --> 05:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:44.400 --> 05:39:26.030 align:start position:0%
 
attention

05:39:26.030 --> 05:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:26.040 --> 05:40:07.570 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:40:07.570 --> 05:40:07.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:11.810 --> 05:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:14.090 --> 05:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
fortunately I have a history of
 
05:40:15.670 --> 05:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
remembering it
 
05:40:18.470 --> 05:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
and going back to the location before
 
05:40:18.480 --> 05:40:27.970 align:start position:0%
and going back to the location before
someone

05:40:27.970 --> 05:40:27.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:30.708 --> 05:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:40:30.718 --> 05:41:19.250 align:start position:0%
all right
foreign

05:41:19.250 --> 05:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:21.708 --> 05:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
so if I have multiple people applying
 
05:41:24.170 --> 05:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
I'll tell them this is how much you
 
05:41:26.448 --> 05:41:26.458 align:start position:0%
leave I will do everything that I can
 
05:41:29.570 --> 05:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
that's free to help creating the reports
 
05:41:32.868 --> 05:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
right and then I can return to you if
 
05:41:35.990 --> 05:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
you don't get it all right how many
 
05:41:36.000 --> 05:41:43.510 align:start position:0%
you don't get it all right how many
times

05:41:43.510 --> 05:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:30.010 --> 05:42:30.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:45.070 --> 05:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:04.090 --> 05:43:04.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:07.190 --> 05:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
30 years later
 
05:43:07.200 --> 05:43:14.208 align:start position:0%
30 years later
luckily

05:43:14.208 --> 05:43:14.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:16.610 --> 05:43:16.620 align:start position:0%
I was at a meeting a few years ago and
 
05:43:18.230 --> 05:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
there was two meetings happening we were
 
05:43:19.490 --> 05:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
in the basement and the other meetings
 
05:43:21.650 --> 05:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
upstairs people coming people coming at
 
05:43:21.660 --> 05:43:23.150 align:start position:0%
upstairs people coming people coming at
us

05:43:23.150 --> 05:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
us
 
05:43:24.770 --> 05:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
so are they going to the meeting
 
05:43:27.230 --> 05:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
upstairs or something a little more
 
05:43:29.570 --> 05:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
function and the Overcomers how do you
 
05:43:31.150 --> 05:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
know their landlords
 
05:43:35.650 --> 05:43:35.660 align:start position:0%
they're dressed for me that's a landlord
 
05:43:38.090 --> 05:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
these people go upstairs they look
 
05:43:41.230 --> 05:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
really wow
 
05:43:43.610 --> 05:43:43.620 align:start position:0%
right right
 
05:43:43.620 --> 05:43:45.410 align:start position:0%
right right
okay

05:43:45.410 --> 05:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:43:45.420 --> 05:43:46.510 align:start position:0%
okay
yeah

05:43:46.510 --> 05:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:46:37.390 --> 05:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:40.548 --> 05:46:40.558 align:start position:0%
79 and representative Reed the prime
 
05:46:44.170 --> 05:46:44.180 align:start position:0%
sponsor we'll hear from you please
 
05:46:47.030 --> 05:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
once again thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:46:49.310 --> 05:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
you honorable members and this is it for
 
05:46:52.430 --> 05:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
me and today with you I know that is
 
05:46:55.670 --> 05:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
exciting news uh this is the last one
 
05:46:58.128 --> 05:46:58.138 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name again is Ellen
 
05:47:01.128 --> 05:47:01.138 align:start position:0%
Reed and I represent Rockingham 10 new
 
05:47:02.868 --> 05:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
market and new fields
 
05:47:06.890 --> 05:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
so this bill creates a bucket
 
05:47:10.788 --> 05:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
into which we have placed one dollar
 
05:47:13.368 --> 05:47:13.378 align:start position:0%
um that sort of kind of but not exactly
 
05:47:17.208 --> 05:47:17.218 align:start position:0%
mimics the uh the criminal defense
 
05:47:19.610 --> 05:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
system that we have in place that most
 
05:47:21.410 --> 05:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
everywhere in the country has in place
 
05:47:23.628 --> 05:47:23.638 align:start position:0%
which is to say that Indigent in this
 
05:47:25.430 --> 05:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
case tenants instead of people accused
 
05:47:27.890 --> 05:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
of crimes and tenants who cannot afford
 
05:47:30.190 --> 05:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
legal representation
 
05:47:32.930 --> 05:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
in eviction proceedings would be able to
 
05:47:34.868 --> 05:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
get attorneys
 
05:47:39.590 --> 05:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
I've never before put in a bill that had
 
05:47:42.350 --> 05:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
a significant appropriation and so I was
 
05:47:44.208 --> 05:47:44.218 align:start position:0%
very hesitant
 
05:47:46.850 --> 05:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
um and considered greatly this issue
 
05:47:48.948 --> 05:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
when I was putting it in
 
05:47:51.410 --> 05:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
um however I'm going I'm spoiler alert I
 
05:47:52.430 --> 05:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
was going to save this for the end but
 
05:47:54.890 --> 05:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tell you right now we very
 
05:47:57.890 --> 05:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
very very likely my constituent is
 
05:48:00.410 --> 05:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
Maggie Hassan she's in my district we
 
05:48:02.208 --> 05:48:02.218 align:start position:0%
very likely have three million dollars
 
05:48:04.910 --> 05:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
from federal money for this I have
 
05:48:07.310 --> 05:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
already met with the Maggie Hassan's
 
05:48:10.430 --> 05:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
aides they're very excited Maggie Hassan
 
05:48:14.628 --> 05:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
has indicated her desire to want to get
 
05:48:17.390 --> 05:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
federal funds for this program and I
 
05:48:19.310 --> 05:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
have a meeting this upcoming Monday
 
05:48:21.770 --> 05:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
another meeting with them as well so
 
05:48:23.868 --> 05:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
when we're creating the bucket it's an
 
05:48:26.208 --> 05:48:26.218 align:start position:0%
empty bucket but it's the idea that we
 
05:48:28.490 --> 05:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
actually will likely be receiving
 
05:48:31.970 --> 05:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
hopefully be receiving federal funds for
 
05:48:34.610 --> 05:48:34.620 align:start position:0%
this program but I want to talk about
 
05:48:36.288 --> 05:48:36.298 align:start position:0%
the reason why we have to have the
 
05:48:39.410 --> 05:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
bucket to begin with so as it currently
 
05:48:41.690 --> 05:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
stands when there is an eviction
 
05:48:45.048 --> 05:48:45.058 align:start position:0%
proceeding there are two sides one is
 
05:48:47.628 --> 05:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
the landlord who frequently has to show
 
05:48:49.250 --> 05:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
up to these eviction proceedings very
 
05:48:53.150 --> 05:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
frequently will have a lawyer that he or
 
05:48:55.930 --> 05:48:55.940 align:start position:0%
she works with on a frequent basis
 
05:48:58.850 --> 05:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
they're very familiar even beyond having
 
05:49:01.970 --> 05:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
a lawyer they are very familiar with the
 
05:49:04.548 --> 05:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
process by which evictions happen
 
05:49:06.230 --> 05:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
they're familiar with the laws they're
 
05:49:08.448 --> 05:49:08.458 align:start position:0%
familiar with the court system they know
 
05:49:11.090 --> 05:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
this from experience they are prepared
 
05:49:13.730 --> 05:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
the tenant on the other hand has very
 
05:49:16.310 --> 05:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
frequently never stepped foot into an
 
05:49:18.288 --> 05:49:18.298 align:start position:0%
eviction Court proceeding doesn't
 
05:49:19.850 --> 05:49:19.860 align:start position:0%
understand doesn't know any of the
 
05:49:21.230 --> 05:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
players doesn't know the law doesn't
 
05:49:23.750 --> 05:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
understand what the Motions can be and
 
05:49:26.330 --> 05:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
so what we've heard and the reason I put
 
05:49:28.548 --> 05:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
this in as requested by New Hampshire
 
05:49:30.128 --> 05:49:30.138 align:start position:0%
legal assistance
 
05:49:32.208 --> 05:49:32.218 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
05:49:36.590 --> 05:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
is very many tenants judges have told
 
05:49:37.970 --> 05:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legal assistance
 
05:49:39.708 --> 05:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
repeatedly that they really really
 
05:49:41.448 --> 05:49:41.458 align:start position:0%
wanted to find for the tenant but the
 
05:49:43.310 --> 05:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
tenant was just lacking the magic words
 
05:49:45.350 --> 05:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
in court didn't know the right motion
 
05:49:47.110 --> 05:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
didn't know the right thing to say or do
 
05:49:49.970 --> 05:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
but it was very clear to the judge in
 
05:49:52.788 --> 05:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
those cases that the the tenant had
 
05:49:55.128 --> 05:49:55.138 align:start position:0%
Merit to their argument but they just
 
05:49:57.048 --> 05:49:57.058 align:start position:0%
were not saying or doing the thing that
 
05:50:00.230 --> 05:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
needed to be done in that moment for
 
05:50:03.048 --> 05:50:03.058 align:start position:0%
what they needed so they need like
 
05:50:04.910 --> 05:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
anybody going through a court proceeding
 
05:50:07.788 --> 05:50:07.798 align:start position:0%
legal representation
 
05:50:11.090 --> 05:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
so we've provided a right a conditional
 
05:50:12.830 --> 05:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
right to legal representation it's
 
05:50:14.990 --> 05:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
conditioned upon having money in the
 
05:50:15.000 --> 05:50:16.010 align:start position:0%
conditioned upon having money in the
bucket

05:50:16.010 --> 05:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
bucket
 
05:50:18.288 --> 05:50:18.298 align:start position:0%
the bucket can be filled by federal
 
05:50:20.270 --> 05:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
funds as I already mentioned are
 
05:50:23.690 --> 05:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
hopefully coming should we pass this but
 
05:50:25.128 --> 05:50:25.138 align:start position:0%
the bucket can also be filled by
 
05:50:27.830 --> 05:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
donations or if we ever have a general
 
05:50:30.530 --> 05:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
court that is so inclined through
 
05:50:34.730 --> 05:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
General funds so that's the basic gist I
 
05:50:37.730 --> 05:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
I while I was hesitant to put this in
 
05:50:39.650 --> 05:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
when I didn't realize we might have
 
05:50:40.810 --> 05:50:40.820 align:start position:0%
money coming
 
05:50:45.170 --> 05:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
I understood the need for it and I knew
 
05:50:48.230 --> 05:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
that the argument would be uh but the
 
05:50:51.170 --> 05:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
money you know and and just so you know
 
05:50:53.510 --> 05:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
I I crunched the numbers with New
 
05:50:55.490 --> 05:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistants and we think
 
05:50:58.128 --> 05:50:58.138 align:start position:0%
it would cost for all of the evictions
 
05:51:01.010 --> 05:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
the percentage of evictions that um are
 
05:51:03.350 --> 05:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
are challenged in court I guess would be
 
05:51:06.230 --> 05:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
the uh term and then the complexity of
 
05:51:08.030 --> 05:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
those cases having broken those numbers
 
05:51:09.708 --> 05:51:09.718 align:start position:0%
down with New Hampshire legal assistance
 
05:51:12.170 --> 05:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
we estimated the fiscal notes may be a
 
05:51:14.390 --> 05:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
tad High we thought it was closer to a
 
05:51:18.288 --> 05:51:18.298 align:start position:0%
million a year the fiscal note says one
 
05:51:20.868 --> 05:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
one and a half million that was our high
 
05:51:22.850 --> 05:51:22.860 align:start position:0%
figure our low figure was much lower
 
05:51:24.590 --> 05:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
than that so
 
05:51:27.530 --> 05:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
um so I when I was talking with Maddie
 
05:51:29.390 --> 05:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
Hassan's legal aids I asked for a
 
05:51:31.430 --> 05:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
million a year and they said absolutely
 
05:51:33.890 --> 05:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
it's completely doable it's a drop in
 
05:51:36.530 --> 05:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
the bucket for federal numbers so
 
05:51:40.368 --> 05:51:40.378 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the gist of why and and
 
05:51:45.110 --> 05:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
the Genesis of this uh but uh when I was
 
05:51:46.788 --> 05:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
considering putting it in I thought that
 
05:51:49.548 --> 05:51:49.558 align:start position:0%
the main argument would be the money
 
05:51:51.890 --> 05:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
um it would be really hard for me to
 
05:51:54.770 --> 05:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
imagine someone coming before you and
 
05:51:56.868 --> 05:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
saying but I don't want the other side
 
05:51:58.910 --> 05:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
in court having a lawyer like I have
 
05:52:01.250 --> 05:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
access to that seems like a really bad
 
05:52:03.288 --> 05:52:03.298 align:start position:0%
argument to me you very well may hear
 
05:52:05.690 --> 05:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
that argument I don't know but I just
 
05:52:08.570 --> 05:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
it's it's an interesting like how like
 
05:52:10.670 --> 05:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
how can you be against people having the
 
05:52:12.830 --> 05:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
ability to have a lawyer
 
05:52:15.830 --> 05:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
like the opposition does in court that
 
05:52:17.750 --> 05:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
that seems to go against the general
 
05:52:17.760 --> 05:52:19.670 align:start position:0%
that seems to go against the general
fairness

05:52:19.670 --> 05:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
fairness
 
05:52:23.810 --> 05:52:23.820 align:start position:0%
I will say that I believe the judicial
 
05:52:27.048 --> 05:52:27.058 align:start position:0%
Council has um is here in favor we've
 
05:52:28.910 --> 05:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
talked about them wanting some extra
 
05:52:31.310 --> 05:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
specifics uh when I was putting the bill
 
05:52:33.230 --> 05:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
together I had consulted them and I said
 
05:52:35.208 --> 05:52:35.218 align:start position:0%
how will this be easiest on the court
 
05:52:35.218 --> 05:52:36.548 align:start position:0%
how will this be easiest on the court
for

05:52:36.548 --> 05:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:52:39.590 --> 05:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
appointing lawyers to people the method
 
05:52:42.110 --> 05:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
that I have here takes some of the extra
 
05:52:44.270 --> 05:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
labor out because we put a 200 percent
 
05:52:47.510 --> 05:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
threshold 200 of poverty line threshold
 
05:52:49.610 --> 05:52:49.620 align:start position:0%
on it so automatically any tenant that's
 
05:52:53.110 --> 05:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
under the 200 percent of poverty would
 
05:52:56.090 --> 05:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
qualify should we have funds for a
 
05:52:57.590 --> 05:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
lawyer whose experience you know if
 
05:53:00.048 --> 05:53:00.058 align:start position:0%
they're experiencing eviction anybody
 
05:53:01.910 --> 05:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
over that then you go through the normal
 
05:53:04.190 --> 05:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
process as we currently have with
 
05:53:07.548 --> 05:53:07.558 align:start position:0%
criminal representation of a judge
 
05:53:09.230 --> 05:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
determining their ability to pay and
 
05:53:10.670 --> 05:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not they qualify for free
 
05:53:10.680 --> 05:53:11.868 align:start position:0%
whether or not they qualify for free
representation

05:53:11.868 --> 05:53:11.878 align:start position:0%
representation
 
05:53:14.750 --> 05:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
so that kind of cuts down on some of the
 
05:53:19.548 --> 05:53:19.558 align:start position:0%
uh the the labor involved there but
 
05:53:22.070 --> 05:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
um I am in conversations with them they
 
05:53:23.750 --> 05:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
want a few more specifics in the bill
 
05:53:25.548 --> 05:53:25.558 align:start position:0%
about exactly where the pool of lawyers
 
05:53:27.890 --> 05:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
would come from probably an expansion of
 
05:53:29.868 --> 05:53:29.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legal assistance
 
05:53:31.190 --> 05:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
um and some other details which I'm
 
05:53:33.230 --> 05:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
happy to work with them on and happy to
 
05:53:35.150 --> 05:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
to kneel those details down as much as
 
05:53:37.490 --> 05:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
they would like to feel good about the
 
05:53:40.128 --> 05:53:40.138 align:start position:0%
bill but so that's kind of everything I
 
05:53:41.868 --> 05:53:41.878 align:start position:0%
think I have to say about this and I'm
 
05:53:43.788 --> 05:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions questions for
 
05:53:46.670 --> 05:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
this witness representative Horrigan
 
05:53:50.288 --> 05:53:50.298 align:start position:0%
yes um in in the fiscal note they
 
05:53:54.970 --> 05:53:54.980 align:start position:0%
they figure 355 dollars per case times
 
05:53:57.890 --> 05:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
4499 landlord tenant cases so is that
 
05:54:00.650 --> 05:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
which comes out to a little less 1.6
 
05:54:02.628 --> 05:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
million dollars some set
 
05:54:04.368 --> 05:54:04.378 align:start position:0%
well it's rounded up to four thousand
 
05:54:05.628 --> 05:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
five hundred is that the number of
 
05:54:07.490 --> 05:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
evictions that were filed in New
 
05:54:11.150 --> 05:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 2021 yeah we we uh when I
 
05:54:12.590 --> 05:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
was working with New Hampshire legal
 
05:54:15.350 --> 05:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
assistants we used the number 5000
 
05:54:16.970 --> 05:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
um and then we use the percentages that
 
05:54:18.708 --> 05:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
we knew were challenged versus not
 
05:54:21.708 --> 05:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
challenged complicated versus simple
 
05:54:23.750 --> 05:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
um based on what New Hampshire legal
 
05:54:26.090 --> 05:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
assistance experience has been yeah and
 
05:54:28.128 --> 05:54:28.138 align:start position:0%
if I understood what he said that and
 
05:54:29.990 --> 05:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
not all of those individuals are going
 
05:54:31.430 --> 05:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
to qualify for this program anyway
 
05:54:31.440 --> 05:54:33.350 align:start position:0%
to qualify for this program anyway
exactly

05:54:33.350 --> 05:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
05:54:35.930 --> 05:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
um although uh you can imagine if you're
 
05:54:37.548 --> 05:54:37.558 align:start position:0%
being evicted most evictions happen for
 
05:54:39.170 --> 05:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
non-payment most of the people who can't
 
05:54:41.990 --> 05:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
pay are lower income so there would be a
 
05:54:44.448 --> 05:54:44.458 align:start position:0%
high rate of of people who qualify but
 
05:54:45.650 --> 05:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
you're right absolutely right not
 
05:54:46.970 --> 05:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
everybody would
 
05:54:48.890 --> 05:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I believe you had a
 
05:54:48.900 --> 05:54:50.810 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I believe you had a
question

05:54:50.810 --> 05:54:50.820 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:54:52.910 --> 05:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Reed as you
 
05:54:54.650 --> 05:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
well know this committee is dealing with
 
05:54:58.670 --> 05:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
the policy not with the funding sure but
 
05:55:00.948 --> 05:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
when we say it's not the money it's
 
05:55:03.048 --> 05:55:03.058 align:start position:0%
always the money it's always the money
 
05:55:03.058 --> 05:55:04.310 align:start position:0%
always the money it's always the money
um

05:55:04.310 --> 05:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:07.128 --> 05:55:07.138 align:start position:0%
and with all due respects to
 
05:55:09.410 --> 05:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
um to the senator
 
05:55:12.470 --> 05:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
um is there any indication that
 
05:55:15.110 --> 05:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
um the governor and the executive
 
05:55:17.990 --> 05:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
Council would accept the money and is
 
05:55:20.750 --> 05:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
there any indication that
 
05:55:23.570 --> 05:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
um uh the finance committee would agree
 
05:55:26.208 --> 05:55:26.218 align:start position:0%
to put this in this budget because
 
05:55:29.030 --> 05:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're talking about two years
 
05:55:30.350 --> 05:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
from now
 
05:55:32.810 --> 05:55:32.820 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the question representative
 
05:55:35.270 --> 05:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
so no I don't have promises from the
 
05:55:37.670 --> 05:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
governor or or the senate or anybody
 
05:55:39.530 --> 05:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
else in the in the process of of
 
05:55:39.540 --> 05:55:41.330 align:start position:0%
else in the in the process of of
legislating

05:55:41.330 --> 05:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
legislating
 
05:55:43.368 --> 05:55:43.378 align:start position:0%
um but free money is usually a good
 
05:55:45.770 --> 05:55:45.780 align:start position:0%
thing we are a donor State we send out
 
05:55:48.350 --> 05:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
more federal tax dollars than we get
 
05:55:51.410 --> 05:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
back and so it's kind of like well you
 
05:55:52.490 --> 05:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
know what do you what do you want for
 
05:55:55.850 --> 05:55:55.860 align:start position:0%
nothing right you get it for free so
 
05:55:58.368 --> 05:55:58.378 align:start position:0%
um and again the language of the bill is
 
05:56:00.230 --> 05:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
self-limiting so if we don't have those
 
05:56:02.390 --> 05:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
funds then this is not a program when we
 
05:56:04.190 --> 05:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
have the funds we do why not have it
 
05:56:06.470 --> 05:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you question
 
05:56:07.970 --> 05:56:07.980 align:start position:0%
representative tur
 
05:56:09.470 --> 05:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks
 
05:56:11.750 --> 05:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
um uh you brought up the the issue that
 
05:56:14.150 --> 05:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
I was going to ask about which is the uh
 
05:56:18.890 --> 05:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
term Indigent versus uh 200 of poverty
 
05:56:20.510 --> 05:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
um terms I sort of work with in my my
 
05:56:22.548 --> 05:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
other world a lot um
 
05:56:24.830 --> 05:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
I I know it goes at the heart of the or
 
05:56:28.430 --> 05:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
the naming of the of the fund itself
 
05:56:31.070 --> 05:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering whether you feel like
 
05:56:33.890 --> 05:56:33.900 align:start position:0%
Indigent is the right term or 200 which
 
05:56:35.810 --> 05:56:35.820 align:start position:0%
is we typically use the term low income
 
05:56:38.270 --> 05:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
for for up to 200 percent of federal
 
05:56:40.788 --> 05:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
poverty whereas indigen sort of implies
 
05:56:43.788 --> 05:56:43.798 align:start position:0%
poverty and unable to meet basic basic
 
05:56:45.470 --> 05:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
needs so I didn't know whether taking
 
05:56:47.448 --> 05:56:47.458 align:start position:0%
out Indigent from the language and just
 
05:56:49.910 --> 05:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
leaving it at a low income 200 of
 
05:56:51.650 --> 05:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
poverty or or if you think the other way
 
05:56:54.170 --> 05:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
or or if you can reconcile those it's
 
05:56:56.628 --> 05:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
because that's the precedent and current
 
05:57:00.170 --> 05:57:00.180 align:start position:0%
statute for criminal defense so it this
 
05:57:02.090 --> 05:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
very closely but not exactly as I
 
05:57:03.890 --> 05:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
already mentioned mirrors How We Do
 
05:57:05.570 --> 05:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
criminal defense
 
05:57:07.250 --> 05:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
um in the public defender's office so
 
05:57:09.770 --> 05:57:09.780 align:start position:0%
that term is understood in the legal
 
05:57:12.288 --> 05:57:12.298 align:start position:0%
realm for our statute to mean inability
 
05:57:14.750 --> 05:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
to pay an inability to pay you can be
 
05:57:16.910 --> 05:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
well over poverty you can be making
 
05:57:18.708 --> 05:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
basic needs but still be unable to
 
05:57:21.230 --> 05:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
afford a lawyer which is very expensive
 
05:57:22.850 --> 05:57:22.860 align:start position:0%
so while
 
05:57:25.490 --> 05:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
I mean I had actually I I can tell you
 
05:57:27.590 --> 05:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
personally when I was going through this
 
05:57:31.010 --> 05:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
bill with the lawyer at OLS I kind of
 
05:57:33.708 --> 05:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
associated the term Indigent with people
 
05:57:36.530 --> 05:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
who were unhoused and so I was like you
 
05:57:37.730 --> 05:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
know there was a lot of confusion I'm
 
05:57:40.310 --> 05:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
like no not Indigent just unable to pay
 
05:57:42.590 --> 05:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
and the lawyer had to explain to me well
 
05:57:44.628 --> 05:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
no legally speaking in our current
 
05:57:47.770 --> 05:57:47.780 align:start position:0%
statute that's exactly what it means
 
05:57:50.030 --> 05:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I I don't have the
 
05:57:52.368 --> 05:57:52.378 align:start position:0%
reference to the other legislation that
 
05:57:54.410 --> 05:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
might be helpful but uh
 
05:57:57.590 --> 05:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
does it reference 200 of poverty no so
 
05:58:00.948 --> 05:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
that's the way I changed it so that's a
 
05:58:04.190 --> 05:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
shortcut that's a labor saving uh move
 
05:58:06.350 --> 05:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
that I made a change that I made to this
 
05:58:08.990 --> 05:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
specifically So currently if you're
 
05:58:11.570 --> 05:58:11.580 align:start position:0%
accused of a crime and you say I need an
 
05:58:14.030 --> 05:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
attorney I can't afford one a judge has
 
05:58:15.770 --> 05:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
to determine your ability to pay before
 
05:58:18.288 --> 05:58:18.298 align:start position:0%
you get that attorney assigned I didn't
 
05:58:20.990 --> 05:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
want to overburden
 
05:58:24.230 --> 05:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
um the judicial clerks or Judiciary
 
05:58:26.330 --> 05:58:26.340 align:start position:0%
clerks in having to go through all that
 
05:58:28.128 --> 05:58:28.138 align:start position:0%
and have all the the judges having to
 
05:58:31.850 --> 05:58:31.860 align:start position:0%
determine say 4 000 cases and whether or
 
05:58:33.708 --> 05:58:33.718 align:start position:0%
not they were able to pay so I gave a
 
05:58:35.708 --> 05:58:35.718 align:start position:0%
shortcut if they are under 200 percent
 
05:58:38.390 --> 05:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
boom they can't afford to pay already it
 
05:58:40.190 --> 05:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to go before a judge if
 
05:58:41.810 --> 05:58:41.820 align:start position:0%
they're over 200 percent a judge will
 
05:58:43.730 --> 05:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
still make that determination
 
05:58:46.368 --> 05:58:46.378 align:start position:0%
so one last follow-up if you would just
 
05:58:48.650 --> 05:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering whether or not cleaning up
 
05:58:50.448 --> 05:58:50.458 align:start position:0%
one or the other would be because I feel
 
05:58:51.830 --> 05:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
like it is mixing two different
 
05:58:54.650 --> 05:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
definitions in in the same
 
05:58:58.910 --> 05:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
um so Indigent contains anyone under 200
 
05:59:02.750 --> 05:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
percent but it's not so everyone who is
 
05:59:06.170 --> 05:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
under 200 percent is Indigent period if
 
05:59:08.090 --> 05:59:08.100 align:start position:0%
you're under 200 the poverty line you're
 
05:59:10.910 --> 05:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
Indigent you you are for lack of a
 
05:59:13.490 --> 05:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
better word poor you cannot afford an
 
05:59:15.230 --> 05:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
attorney if you're under if you're at or
 
05:59:18.288 --> 05:59:18.298 align:start position:0%
under 200 of poverty line
 
05:59:21.048 --> 05:59:21.058 align:start position:0%
um if you're over it you may still be
 
05:59:23.150 --> 05:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
Indigent but that's going to be up to a
 
05:59:27.670 --> 05:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:29.510 --> 05:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't mean if I didn't mean to
 
05:59:31.010 --> 05:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
interrupt you if you want to I was just
 
05:59:32.208 --> 05:59:32.218 align:start position:0%
gonna say but you're definitely Indigent
 
05:59:33.948 --> 05:59:33.958 align:start position:0%
if you're under 200 so there was no
 
05:59:35.750 --> 05:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
reason to put the judges through all of
 
05:59:37.730 --> 05:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
those cases most of the people applying
 
05:59:40.310 --> 05:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
for this will be under 200 percent
 
05:59:42.590 --> 05:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
other question for this witness
 
05:59:45.770 --> 05:59:45.780 align:start position:0%
um oh representative Perez okay
 
05:59:47.390 --> 05:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:59:49.250 --> 05:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
I just say if you're
 
05:59:52.430 --> 05:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
under 200 percent you are Indigent where
 
05:59:54.410 --> 05:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
did that definition come from is that
 
05:59:57.350 --> 05:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
the definition as opposed to as as
 
06:00:00.948 --> 06:00:00.958 align:start position:0%
proposed here yes that's so proposed
 
06:00:03.948 --> 06:00:03.958 align:start position:0%
here yes the idea is so in the current
 
06:00:06.170 --> 06:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
criminal defense World Indigent means
 
06:00:07.910 --> 06:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
unable to pay for a lawyer you cannot
 
06:00:10.070 --> 06:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
afford a lawyer we're saying in this
 
06:00:12.288 --> 06:00:12.298 align:start position:0%
bill if you're under 200 of the poverty
 
06:00:13.490 --> 06:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
line and just to be really clear the
 
06:00:15.410 --> 06:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
poverty line something like 24 25 000
 
06:00:16.910 --> 06:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
for a family
 
06:00:19.610 --> 06:00:19.620 align:start position:0%
so if you're 50 000 for a family you
 
06:00:21.650 --> 06:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
can't pay you cannot afford a lawyer a
 
06:00:23.930 --> 06:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
lawyer is very expensive so that's what
 
06:00:25.510 --> 06:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
we're saying
 
06:00:29.990 --> 06:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
yes and you're saying the tenant
 
06:00:32.030 --> 06:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
but you're talking about a family as
 
06:00:34.010 --> 06:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
opposed to a tenant
 
06:00:34.020 --> 06:00:36.110 align:start position:0%
opposed to a tenant
um

06:00:36.110 --> 06:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:37.970 --> 06:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
that's different who's on the lease
 
06:00:41.990 --> 06:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
maybe you and not your family who is
 
06:00:44.570 --> 06:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
this so you qualify for the pot where
 
06:00:46.970 --> 06:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
you are on the poverty line is based on
 
06:00:50.150 --> 06:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not you live alone or with a
 
06:00:52.970 --> 06:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
household so that's kind of separate
 
06:00:55.190 --> 06:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
this is well understood and I understand
 
06:00:57.350 --> 06:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
very public and also private
 
06:00:59.690 --> 06:00:59.700 align:start position:0%
institutions for calculating if somebody
 
06:01:01.690 --> 06:01:01.700 align:start position:0%
qualifies for example my local hospital
 
06:01:04.128 --> 06:01:04.138 align:start position:0%
provides uh financial assistance for
 
06:01:06.890 --> 06:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
medical bills if you're 250 percent of
 
06:01:09.948 --> 06:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
poverty or under so it's understood to
 
06:01:12.410 --> 06:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
be if you live alone I believe the
 
06:01:14.990 --> 06:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
number is twelve five twelve thousand
 
06:01:16.190 --> 06:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
five hundred I could be wrong it's
 
06:01:18.048 --> 06:01:18.058 align:start position:0%
somewhere in that ballpark though and if
 
06:01:19.788 --> 06:01:19.798 align:start position:0%
you are in a family it's something like
 
06:01:21.530 --> 06:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand
 
06:01:24.110 --> 06:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
06:01:26.810 --> 06:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
so I guess I I do have a question and
 
06:01:29.390 --> 06:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm really not I actually have two
 
06:01:31.610 --> 06:01:31.620 align:start position:0%
questions and I'm not sure you if I'm
 
06:01:34.070 --> 06:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly you said that
 
06:01:36.110 --> 06:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
there's Federal money
 
06:01:39.890 --> 06:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
available to pay for counsel a good
 
06:01:42.048 --> 06:01:42.058 align:start position:0%
promise of federal money
 
06:01:44.810 --> 06:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
um very specifically Maggie Hassan is
 
06:01:47.868 --> 06:01:47.878 align:start position:0%
very interested in kind of prioritizing
 
06:01:50.510 --> 06:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
housing and her team as I said this is
 
06:01:51.830 --> 06:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
something I want to do and I have a
 
06:01:53.448 --> 06:01:53.458 align:start position:0%
second meeting with them that they
 
06:01:56.690 --> 06:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
reached out to to make about this so I
 
06:01:58.310 --> 06:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
guess what the thing that I'm not clear
 
06:02:02.330 --> 06:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
on though is that's if that's the case
 
06:02:05.090 --> 06:02:05.100 align:start position:0%
I'm not clear why we need this bill
 
06:02:08.570 --> 06:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
because the uh
 
06:02:10.970 --> 06:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
I I don't fault you for for this at all
 
06:02:13.368 --> 06:02:13.378 align:start position:0%
but but you should understand that a
 
06:02:15.410 --> 06:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
person has the right
 
06:02:19.010 --> 06:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
to an attorney in almost any judicial
 
06:02:22.868 --> 06:02:22.878 align:start position:0%
proceeding so so the question the the
 
06:02:26.990 --> 06:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
when we use the right to counsel
 
06:02:29.030 --> 06:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
um what we're when we talk about the
 
06:02:30.530 --> 06:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
right to counsel in this bill you're
 
06:02:32.628 --> 06:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
talking the right to have Council paid
 
06:02:35.570 --> 06:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
for by the government and so what I'm
 
06:02:36.948 --> 06:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
really asking is
 
06:02:40.128 --> 06:02:40.138 align:start position:0%
if the government is has got this money
 
06:02:41.810 --> 06:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
that it's for the federal government has
 
06:02:44.090 --> 06:02:44.100 align:start position:0%
got this money that it's willing to pay
 
06:02:46.788 --> 06:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
for counsel for people to be represented
 
06:02:49.690 --> 06:02:49.700 align:start position:0%
when they're being evicted
 
06:02:53.330 --> 06:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
they can just give that money to Legal
 
06:02:56.208 --> 06:02:56.218 align:start position:0%
Aid and legal aid can can come in and
 
06:02:58.730 --> 06:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
say when somebody is being evicted
 
06:03:00.170 --> 06:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
legally Aid can come in and say we'll
 
06:03:02.510 --> 06:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
we'll pay the bill for this attorney and
 
06:03:04.368 --> 06:03:04.378 align:start position:0%
the judge would have no choice but to
 
06:03:05.930 --> 06:03:05.940 align:start position:0%
appoint counsel for them because they
 
06:03:08.448 --> 06:03:08.458 align:start position:0%
have a right if if the judge doesn't get
 
06:03:10.490 --> 06:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
to ask who's paying for the for the bill
 
06:03:12.708 --> 06:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
unless it's the state that's paying so
 
06:03:15.170 --> 06:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
why do why do we I guess I'm really
 
06:03:17.330 --> 06:03:17.340 align:start position:0%
asking why do we need this why can't the
 
06:03:19.850 --> 06:03:19.860 align:start position:0%
senator Hassan just you know get the
 
06:03:22.548 --> 06:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
money appropriated and it gets sent to
 
06:03:24.170 --> 06:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
Legal Aid in New Hampshire or whatever
 
06:03:26.690 --> 06:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
the the lawyer groups are and they
 
06:03:29.270 --> 06:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
provide legal representation thank you
 
06:03:31.910 --> 06:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
there's there is no Administration like
 
06:03:33.650 --> 06:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
with all federal funds that come to the
 
06:03:35.390 --> 06:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
state we are in charge of administering
 
06:03:37.910 --> 06:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
it so while you're suggesting that they
 
06:03:40.310 --> 06:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
just go through a private non-profit
 
06:03:42.470 --> 06:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
legal assistance I suppose that's
 
06:03:45.708 --> 06:03:45.718 align:start position:0%
possible but in terms of giving it to
 
06:03:47.208 --> 06:03:47.218 align:start position:0%
the government because that's what
 
06:03:48.350 --> 06:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
they're allocating they're got like
 
06:03:49.548 --> 06:03:49.558 align:start position:0%
hitting it to New Hampshire the new
 
06:03:51.230 --> 06:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has to decide what to do with
 
06:03:53.628 --> 06:03:53.638 align:start position:0%
it all of that is Administrative so we
 
06:03:55.910 --> 06:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
need that structure in place in order to
 
06:03:58.070 --> 06:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
provide those systems if they just hand
 
06:03:59.690 --> 06:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
US money we don't know what to do with
 
06:04:01.310 --> 06:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
it and we have to decide what to do with
 
06:04:03.830 --> 06:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
it and we name those systems just as
 
06:04:05.690 --> 06:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
they do as I understand it and you
 
06:04:06.770 --> 06:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but as I
 
06:04:07.850 --> 06:04:07.860 align:start position:0%
understand it the federal government
 
06:04:10.310 --> 06:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
gives money to non-profits for all kinds
 
06:04:11.690 --> 06:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
of things why couldn't they just give
 
06:04:15.110 --> 06:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
money for this representation to Legal
 
06:04:16.368 --> 06:04:16.378 align:start position:0%
Assistance New Hampshire legal
 
06:04:19.010 --> 06:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
assistance and other you know and and if
 
06:04:20.810 --> 06:04:20.820 align:start position:0%
there are other groups that provide this
 
06:04:22.310 --> 06:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
assistance without the state being
 
06:04:23.868 --> 06:04:23.878 align:start position:0%
involved at all
 
06:04:25.970 --> 06:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
I suppose I mean yes you're right they
 
06:04:28.490 --> 06:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
could do that as I already said but I
 
06:04:30.350 --> 06:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
think in terms of having a structure
 
06:04:32.690 --> 06:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
whereby we guarantee a right to counsel
 
06:04:34.850 --> 06:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
and if you cannot pay a Ford Council we
 
06:04:37.070 --> 06:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
provide one which is what we want to
 
06:04:40.070 --> 06:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
achieve that requires an administrative
 
06:04:40.080 --> 06:04:44.510 align:start position:0%
achieve that requires an administrative
structure

06:04:44.510 --> 06:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:47.810 --> 06:04:47.820 align:start position:0%
well I guess I I mean I I okay I don't I
 
06:04:49.490 --> 06:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
just I'm not gonna I'm not gonna argue
 
06:04:50.750 --> 06:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
with you about that but I guess what I
 
06:04:51.830 --> 06:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
was saying what I was trying to say
 
06:04:55.250 --> 06:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
before was there is a there is a right
 
06:04:58.730 --> 06:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
to counsel that a court if somebody can
 
06:05:02.030 --> 06:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
pay for a lawyer a court can't say no
 
06:05:03.890 --> 06:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
you can't have a lawyer I mean unless I
 
06:05:05.930 --> 06:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
understand so so that's what I'm really
 
06:05:07.430 --> 06:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
saying there was the second part that I
 
06:05:08.990 --> 06:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
emphasized but I'll emphasize it again
 
06:05:11.090 --> 06:05:11.100 align:start position:0%
as we all hear in like every cop show
 
06:05:12.948 --> 06:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
since forever you have a right to an
 
06:05:14.628 --> 06:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
attorney and if you cannot afford one
 
06:05:17.990 --> 06:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
one will be provided to you we want that
 
06:05:20.270 --> 06:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
kind of assurance so long as there are
 
06:05:22.548 --> 06:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
funds for it we want that kind of
 
06:05:24.170 --> 06:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
assurance for tenants experiencing
 
06:05:27.770 --> 06:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
eviction because housing is necessary
 
06:05:29.150 --> 06:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
for life
 
06:05:30.890 --> 06:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
all right other questions for
 
06:05:33.590 --> 06:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative Smith it's not actually a
 
06:05:36.650 --> 06:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
a question but I do want to clarify the
 
06:05:39.590 --> 06:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
difference between a civil and a
 
06:05:43.128 --> 06:05:43.138 align:start position:0%
criminal proceeding in court and
 
06:05:46.730 --> 06:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
um watching whatever you're watching
 
06:05:49.250 --> 06:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
um that's criminal no I'm very well
 
06:05:52.730 --> 06:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
aware that guaranteed does not exist in
 
06:05:55.070 --> 06:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
civil but that's why you have the bill
 
06:05:57.770 --> 06:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
exactly that's I'm exactly aware of that
 
06:05:59.810 --> 06:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
that's why I keep saying we have this
 
06:06:01.910 --> 06:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
for criminal we want to have something
 
06:06:05.090 --> 06:06:05.100 align:start position:0%
like this for people's ability to live
 
06:06:06.590 --> 06:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
that's the point
 
06:06:09.350 --> 06:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
and while I'm not going to to say that
 
06:06:10.970 --> 06:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
you you just have to guarantee it like
 
06:06:12.590 --> 06:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
we do with the criminal side we
 
06:06:14.030 --> 06:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
guarantee it and we just put money
 
06:06:15.770 --> 06:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
behind it and then you have overburdened
 
06:06:17.510 --> 06:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
public defenders and all that what I'm
 
06:06:19.128 --> 06:06:19.138 align:start position:0%
saying is we're guaranteeing it as long
 
06:06:21.288 --> 06:06:21.298 align:start position:0%
as we have the money the empty bucket is
 
06:06:23.868 --> 06:06:23.878 align:start position:0%
made if the bucket is full we're going
 
06:06:26.090 --> 06:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
to provide that same guarantee that we
 
06:06:28.490 --> 06:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
provide people I mean I would argue well
 
06:06:30.670 --> 06:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
I think that the right to an attorney
 
06:06:33.470 --> 06:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
and to be provided in turn if you cannot
 
06:06:37.368 --> 06:06:37.378 align:start position:0%
afford one is absolutely necessary for
 
06:06:38.570 --> 06:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
our criminal system that we should
 
06:06:40.788 --> 06:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely guarantee that on a whole
 
06:06:42.170 --> 06:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
other level these are people you know
 
06:06:43.788 --> 06:06:43.798 align:start position:0%
accused of crimes
 
06:06:47.208 --> 06:06:47.218 align:start position:0%
versus people who need a place to live a
 
06:06:49.310 --> 06:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
roof over their head and then on some
 
06:06:51.770 --> 06:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
level that is more basic that is more
 
06:06:53.990 --> 06:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
basic so yes the whole point of the bill
 
06:06:56.030 --> 06:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
as I tried to answer with the chairs
 
06:06:57.410 --> 06:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
question and try and answered with your
 
06:06:59.868 --> 06:06:59.878 align:start position:0%
question is to have a mirror more or
 
06:07:02.510 --> 06:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
less a mirror of what we do for
 
06:07:03.948 --> 06:07:03.958 align:start position:0%
assurances for people charged with
 
06:07:07.070 --> 06:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
crimes but experiencing
 
06:07:11.868 --> 06:07:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:14.510 --> 06:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
yes Richard head is here I'm not sure if
 
06:07:16.128 --> 06:07:16.138 align:start position:0%
there's someone else uh let me see well
 
06:07:18.650 --> 06:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:21.230 --> 06:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
all right hang on thanks I have your
 
06:07:23.690 --> 06:07:23.700 align:start position:0%
legal assistance uh
 
06:07:26.990 --> 06:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
and he called me this morning no I I do
 
06:07:28.910 --> 06:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
not see anyone here from the judicial
 
06:07:31.010 --> 06:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
Council Richard head is here but but uh
 
06:07:32.750 --> 06:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
no one's from the judicial account
 
06:07:32.760 --> 06:07:35.448 align:start position:0%
no one's from the judicial account
um

06:07:35.448 --> 06:07:35.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:37.368 --> 06:07:37.378 align:start position:0%
uh no legal system someone is here from
 
06:07:39.650 --> 06:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legal assistance yes yep
 
06:07:41.390 --> 06:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
um so I you know I guess in light of the
 
06:07:43.670 --> 06:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
the your your the in the interplay
 
06:07:45.230 --> 06:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
between you and and uh representative
 
06:07:48.110 --> 06:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
Smith you have one other question is um
 
06:07:52.430 --> 06:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
the way this bill is worded it doesn't
 
06:07:54.948 --> 06:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
seem to make
 
06:07:57.410 --> 06:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
the the rights of counsel that you
 
06:08:00.048 --> 06:08:00.058 align:start position:0%
create by the bill contingent upon there
 
06:08:01.788 --> 06:08:01.798 align:start position:0%
being Federal funding and so my question
 
06:08:04.788 --> 06:08:04.798 align:start position:0%
is would you have any objection if there
 
06:08:07.250 --> 06:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
was an amendment that said
 
06:08:10.310 --> 06:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
essentially the right established in
 
06:08:14.330 --> 06:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
paragraph 3A parenthesis a
 
06:08:16.548 --> 06:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
comes into effect only if there's
 
06:08:19.010 --> 06:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
Federal money to pay for it
 
06:08:21.590 --> 06:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm almost positive I put that in the
 
06:08:24.170 --> 06:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
bill uh in fact I am positive I put it
 
06:08:25.868 --> 06:08:25.878 align:start position:0%
in the bill and this may be an error on
 
06:08:28.070 --> 06:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
ols's part that it didn't make it into
 
06:08:31.070 --> 06:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
you know through some some redraft if it
 
06:08:33.350 --> 06:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
is in fact not there but I very
 
06:08:35.628 --> 06:08:35.638 align:start position:0%
specifically had exactly what you're
 
06:08:37.610 --> 06:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
referring to which is there is a right
 
06:08:40.368 --> 06:08:40.378 align:start position:0%
to counsel a right to paid Council for
 
06:08:42.410 --> 06:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
Indigent tenants experiencing eviction
 
06:08:46.190 --> 06:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
but it is contingent upon uh there being
 
06:08:49.310 --> 06:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
money in those funds
 
06:08:51.948 --> 06:08:51.958 align:start position:0%
I I can I can keep looking for it yeah I
 
06:08:53.390 --> 06:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
didn't see that as I looked at it but I
 
06:08:55.430 --> 06:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
you know I looked quickly too so I could
 
06:08:58.430 --> 06:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
be wrong line 13 the judicial Council
 
06:09:00.470 --> 06:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
said shall administer the fund and Shout
 
06:09:02.030 --> 06:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
to the extent available of available
 
06:09:03.708 --> 06:09:03.718 align:start position:0%
federal state or private funds pay the
 
06:09:05.030 --> 06:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
cost of council and investigative
 
06:09:08.090 --> 06:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
experts or other services la la
 
06:09:08.100 --> 06:09:10.368 align:start position:0%
experts or other services la la
okay

06:09:10.368 --> 06:09:10.378 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:09:12.830 --> 06:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
right right it's not only but I mean you
 
06:09:14.208 --> 06:09:14.218 align:start position:0%
and you and you wouldn't you would
 
06:09:15.708 --> 06:09:15.718 align:start position:0%
interpret that to mean that that's a
 
06:09:17.510 --> 06:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
limit if they if there's no federal
 
06:09:19.548 --> 06:09:19.558 align:start position:0%
money then they don't have to do it
 
06:09:21.650 --> 06:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
I do interpret that to mean that but I I
 
06:09:23.930 --> 06:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
very specifically remember a different
 
06:09:27.350 --> 06:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
section that we put in that the right to
 
06:09:28.670 --> 06:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
an attorney
 
06:09:31.970 --> 06:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
paid for asterisk as the chair has
 
06:09:34.250 --> 06:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
rightly uh pointed out
 
06:09:37.548 --> 06:09:37.558 align:start position:0%
um was in fact contingent on on money in
 
06:09:39.590 --> 06:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
the funds so I'll need a second to look
 
06:09:41.810 --> 06:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
over the bill but if in fact it didn't
 
06:09:43.250 --> 06:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
make its way into this particular
 
06:09:44.990 --> 06:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
version I'm happy to put it in all right
 
06:09:47.690 --> 06:09:47.700 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
06:09:51.890 --> 06:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:54.590 --> 06:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
we keep hearing in here that
 
06:09:56.390 --> 06:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
06:09:58.548 --> 06:09:58.558 align:start position:0%
real money this is
 
06:10:01.670 --> 06:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
yeah could you just get closer to the
 
06:10:03.830 --> 06:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
microphone please thank you we keep
 
06:10:05.570 --> 06:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
hearing that this isn't real money this
 
06:10:07.010 --> 06:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
is federal money
 
06:10:08.990 --> 06:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I consider Federal money real money
 
06:10:12.470 --> 06:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh but Deuce this paragraph or sentence
 
06:10:14.690 --> 06:10:14.700 align:start position:0%
that they talk about in here says
 
06:10:17.628 --> 06:10:17.638 align:start position:0%
federal state or private funds I don't
 
06:10:19.670 --> 06:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
care about private funds I really care
 
06:10:22.310 --> 06:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
about private and federal and state
 
06:10:25.910 --> 06:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
yeah it to me if I go down to
 
06:10:28.430 --> 06:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
Appropriations it brings Appropriations
 
06:10:31.128 --> 06:10:31.138 align:start position:0%
back after that one if I don't have
 
06:10:33.530 --> 06:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
Federal money I'm going to pull this out
 
06:10:35.510 --> 06:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
of the state thing and I think this is
 
06:10:37.670 --> 06:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
crazy it's crazy money to begin with to
 
06:10:40.730 --> 06:10:40.740 align:start position:0%
think that oh this is free money but
 
06:10:43.910 --> 06:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
but to say that there's not some State
 
06:10:46.670 --> 06:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
pile of money right behind this whole
 
06:10:49.788 --> 06:10:49.798 align:start position:0%
thing is just wrong so it's a couple
 
06:10:53.270 --> 06:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
points there and I mean I presume you'll
 
06:10:55.010 --> 06:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
say don't you agree because that wasn't
 
06:10:58.788 --> 06:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
a question but a couple points so first
 
06:11:01.310 --> 06:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
of all it's not made up money or federal
 
06:11:02.930 --> 06:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
money or you know that's you know
 
06:11:05.510 --> 06:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
whatever money it's our money it is the
 
06:11:07.850 --> 06:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money of this state that pay
 
06:11:11.090 --> 06:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
taxes in their paychecks going to the
 
06:11:13.128 --> 06:11:13.138 align:start position:0%
federal government we are a donor state
 
06:11:15.410 --> 06:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
which means we pay out more than we get
 
06:11:18.170 --> 06:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
back in So for us to get our money back
 
06:11:20.930 --> 06:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
is a good thing
 
06:11:22.730 --> 06:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
um secondly there's nothing in this bill
 
06:11:24.288 --> 06:11:24.298 align:start position:0%
that says if we don't get Federal money
 
06:11:25.970 --> 06:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
it automatically is going to come out of
 
06:11:27.830 --> 06:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
the general funds absolutely not it is a
 
06:11:29.750 --> 06:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
one dollar bucket if you want I will
 
06:11:32.868 --> 06:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
give you a dollar right now and it just
 
06:11:34.670 --> 06:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
creates the bucket that's all there is
 
06:11:37.490 --> 06:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
so if if it's unfunded because we don't
 
06:11:39.110 --> 06:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
get federal funds or whatever other
 
06:11:42.288 --> 06:11:42.298 align:start position:0%
funds then it just sits empty
 
06:11:43.970 --> 06:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
I just agree with you completely but
 
06:11:45.830 --> 06:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
well that's not the process
 
06:11:48.230 --> 06:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
all right other questions for this yes
 
06:11:50.030 --> 06:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative Grissom thank you Mr
 
06:11:51.170 --> 06:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
06:11:53.270 --> 06:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
taking our questions uh in thinking
 
06:11:55.670 --> 06:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
about future funding for this if it were
 
06:11:57.470 --> 06:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
to come into existence because when
 
06:12:00.590 --> 06:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
something comes in it never goes away uh
 
06:12:03.470 --> 06:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
and So eventually we're we as a state
 
06:12:06.170 --> 06:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
will be on the hook for paying for this
 
06:12:08.690 --> 06:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
program at some point down the line so
 
06:12:12.730 --> 06:12:12.740 align:start position:0%
would there be a possibility of having
 
06:12:16.670 --> 06:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
establishing an Indigent tenant fee that
 
06:12:19.310 --> 06:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
could be charged to tenants at the
 
06:12:21.170 --> 06:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
signing of a lease collected by the
 
06:12:23.690 --> 06:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
landlord that would be sent in to the
 
06:12:26.330 --> 06:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
treasury and that would help to pay for
 
06:12:29.090 --> 06:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
however much the dollar amount would be
 
06:12:31.430 --> 06:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
we can figure that out but based on 4
 
06:12:33.830 --> 06:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
500 cases at 100 bucks a piece there's
 
06:12:38.150 --> 06:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
450 000 but at least the tenant now has
 
06:12:40.490 --> 06:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
skin in the game they they're at least
 
06:12:42.110 --> 06:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
contributing toward their own defense
 
06:12:44.868 --> 06:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
they're at least providing some means uh
 
06:12:47.350 --> 06:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
so it's not completely on
 
06:12:49.548 --> 06:12:49.558 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in general but they are
 
06:12:50.868 --> 06:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
actually contributing part of that
 
06:12:52.310 --> 06:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
themselves so first of all they are
 
06:12:54.110 --> 06:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that is their money coming
 
06:12:56.030 --> 06:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
back to them secondly we're not on the
 
06:12:57.470 --> 06:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
hook if it's an empty bucket it's an
 
06:12:59.150 --> 06:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
empty bucket we're not obligated to fill
 
06:13:00.590 --> 06:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
the bucket
 
06:13:04.250 --> 06:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
um thirdly I would while I am very open
 
06:13:07.368 --> 06:13:07.378 align:start position:0%
to a whole host of creative ways to fund
 
06:13:09.410 --> 06:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
this bucket I would
 
06:13:12.350 --> 06:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
I would caution against saying that
 
06:13:14.150 --> 06:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
Indigent tenants by their definition
 
06:13:17.868 --> 06:13:17.878 align:start position:0%
they are low to maybe moderate income
 
06:13:19.788 --> 06:13:19.798 align:start position:0%
um don't have skin in the game already
 
06:13:21.948 --> 06:13:21.958 align:start position:0%
it's the roof over their head they are
 
06:13:23.868 --> 06:13:23.878 align:start position:0%
fighting for they definitely have skin
 
06:13:25.788 --> 06:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
in the game and they've already paid for
 
06:13:28.910 --> 06:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
it through their federal taxes so
 
06:13:31.128 --> 06:13:31.138 align:start position:0%
um they asking in the game the idea of
 
06:13:32.990 --> 06:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
charging an Indigent person even more
 
06:13:35.448 --> 06:13:35.458 align:start position:0%
money for a program that we're trying to
 
06:13:36.770 --> 06:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
help them with doesn't seem to make
 
06:13:38.270 --> 06:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
sense to me but I'm open to different
 
06:13:40.190 --> 06:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
ideas I appreciate the creative thinking
 
06:13:41.750 --> 06:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm open to having that discussion
 
06:13:44.090 --> 06:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
and having more ideas about how to fund
 
06:13:45.650 --> 06:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
this in the future
 
06:13:47.330 --> 06:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you all right representative
 
06:13:47.340 --> 06:13:48.770 align:start position:0%
thank you all right representative
Horrigan

06:13:48.770 --> 06:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
Horrigan
 
06:13:48.780 --> 06:13:50.570 align:start position:0%
Horrigan
um

06:13:50.570 --> 06:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:53.090 --> 06:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
first of all um first of all I point out
 
06:13:54.410 --> 06:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
that the idea we just heard from the
 
06:13:56.750 --> 06:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
member from Wentworth is a new fee so
 
06:13:58.380 --> 06:13:58.390 align:start position:0%
but um
 
06:13:58.390 --> 06:13:59.690 align:start position:0%
but um
[Music]

06:13:59.690 --> 06:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:14:01.850 --> 06:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
but is if if this if for some reason
 
06:14:04.490 --> 06:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of uh so much this program
 
06:14:06.830 --> 06:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
is such a success it's so popular it
 
06:14:08.510 --> 06:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
benefits uh not just the tenants
 
06:14:10.670 --> 06:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
themselves from usually a whole
 
06:14:12.410 --> 06:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
um such a way that perhaps we're tempted
 
06:14:14.570 --> 06:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
to keep it going even if the federal
 
06:14:17.208 --> 06:14:17.218 align:start position:0%
funding draws away is that necessarily a
 
06:14:19.548 --> 06:14:19.558 align:start position:0%
bad thing if we decide that's a good
 
06:14:22.430 --> 06:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
thing to spend 1.6 million dollars a
 
06:14:24.650 --> 06:14:24.660 align:start position:0%
year of our limited State funding on
 
06:14:27.948 --> 06:14:27.958 align:start position:0%
it's it's as is every biennium when we
 
06:14:30.410 --> 06:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
pass a budget it is a the truest
 
06:14:32.750 --> 06:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
reflections of truest reflection our
 
06:14:34.368 --> 06:14:34.378 align:start position:0%
budget is the Jewish reflection of our
 
06:14:37.490 --> 06:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
values as a legislative body we
 
06:14:39.948 --> 06:14:39.958 align:start position:0%
determine what we are willing to fund
 
06:14:42.110 --> 06:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
based on our priorities based on our
 
06:14:44.510 --> 06:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
value system if we have a general court
 
06:14:45.948 --> 06:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
at some point in the future that
 
06:14:47.510 --> 06:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
determines that this has been so
 
06:14:49.250 --> 06:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
successful with federal funds that it's
 
06:14:51.048 --> 06:14:51.058 align:start position:0%
worth continuing with State funds and
 
06:14:52.910 --> 06:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's up to that legislative body in
 
06:14:55.910 --> 06:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
that term as as is every other budget
 
06:14:59.090 --> 06:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
decision I will say that this does in
 
06:15:00.650 --> 06:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
the long run
 
06:15:03.170 --> 06:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
um very frequently help landlords too
 
06:15:06.048 --> 06:15:06.058 align:start position:0%
because what frequently happens when you
 
06:15:09.170 --> 06:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
have legal counsel for both sides is a
 
06:15:11.690 --> 06:15:11.700 align:start position:0%
mediation process process so that you
 
06:15:14.690 --> 06:15:14.700 align:start position:0%
can avoid the expensive eviction
 
06:15:14.700 --> 06:15:16.850 align:start position:0%
can avoid the expensive eviction
proceedings

06:15:16.850 --> 06:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
06:15:19.490 --> 06:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness thank
 
06:15:21.650 --> 06:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you so much that's
 
06:15:24.548 --> 06:15:24.558 align:start position:0%
it for me thank you
 
06:15:42.170 --> 06:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:46.368 --> 06:15:46.378 align:start position:0%
hi so I'm Eric Gallagher uh
 
06:15:49.070 --> 06:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
we're the representative for Concord
 
06:15:51.230 --> 06:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
Ward 6 which is Merrimack County
 
06:15:55.490 --> 06:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
District 20 and I am a co-sponsor on
 
06:15:59.628 --> 06:15:59.638 align:start position:0%
this bill here speaking in support of it
 
06:15:59.638 --> 06:16:00.288 align:start position:0%
this bill here speaking in support of it
um

06:16:00.288 --> 06:16:00.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:00.298 --> 06:16:02.510 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:16:02.510 --> 06:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:16:05.810 --> 06:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
the Sixth Amendment to the United States
 
06:16:05.820 --> 06:16:07.208 align:start position:0%
the Sixth Amendment to the United States
Constitution

06:16:07.208 --> 06:16:07.218 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
06:16:10.490 --> 06:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
guarantees a right to council and the
 
06:16:13.490 --> 06:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
U.S Supreme Court upheld that right in
 
06:16:15.650 --> 06:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
Gideon versus Wainwright
 
06:16:15.660 --> 06:16:16.368 align:start position:0%
Gideon versus Wainwright
um

06:16:16.368 --> 06:16:16.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:20.690 --> 06:16:20.700 align:start position:0%
for criminal cases so yeah
 
06:16:23.150 --> 06:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
representative Smith was bringing up the
 
06:16:25.970 --> 06:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
criminal versus civil distinction before
 
06:16:29.048 --> 06:16:29.058 align:start position:0%
this extends it to
 
06:16:31.250 --> 06:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
civil cases
 
06:16:33.948 --> 06:16:33.958 align:start position:0%
where a tenant is being evicted
 
06:16:33.958 --> 06:16:35.510 align:start position:0%
where a tenant is being evicted
which

06:16:35.510 --> 06:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
which
 
06:16:38.628 --> 06:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
I think tenants would very much
 
06:16:38.638 --> 06:16:40.128 align:start position:0%
I think tenants would very much
appreciate

06:16:40.128 --> 06:16:40.138 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
06:16:40.138 --> 06:16:41.390 align:start position:0%
appreciate
um

06:16:41.390 --> 06:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:44.270 --> 06:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
a bit more about the criminal civil
 
06:16:44.280 --> 06:16:46.128 align:start position:0%
a bit more about the criminal civil
distinction

06:16:46.128 --> 06:16:46.138 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
06:16:46.138 --> 06:16:47.390 align:start position:0%
distinction
um

06:16:47.390 --> 06:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:47.400 --> 06:16:48.948 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:16:48.948 --> 06:16:48.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:16:52.670 --> 06:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
even though that might exist in the
 
06:16:54.230 --> 06:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
course part
 
06:16:57.410 --> 06:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
from the tennis point of view
 
06:16:57.420 --> 06:16:59.090 align:start position:0%
from the tennis point of view
so

06:16:59.090 --> 06:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:17:02.810 --> 06:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
police will still come to evict you if
 
06:17:04.310 --> 06:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
you're getting evicted that was
 
06:17:04.320 --> 06:17:06.170 align:start position:0%
you're getting evicted that was
something

06:17:06.170 --> 06:17:06.180 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:17:06.180 --> 06:17:06.890 align:start position:0%
something
um

06:17:06.890 --> 06:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:09.708 --> 06:17:09.718 align:start position:0%
where our County Sheriff here in
 
06:17:12.530 --> 06:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County David Croft has made
 
06:17:14.570 --> 06:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
news for trying to
 
06:17:18.708 --> 06:17:18.718 align:start position:0%
do that in a more humane way of
 
06:17:21.470 --> 06:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
you know collecting other good people
 
06:17:25.490 --> 06:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
with services and whatnot but still the
 
06:17:28.368 --> 06:17:28.378 align:start position:0%
fact is that it's the police do it so
 
06:17:28.378 --> 06:17:29.510 align:start position:0%
fact is that it's the police do it so
from

06:17:29.510 --> 06:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:17:31.730 --> 06:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
the tennis point of view
 
06:17:35.750 --> 06:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
the criminal civil distinction
 
06:17:38.090 --> 06:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
might not really be that visible to them
 
06:17:40.548 --> 06:17:40.558 align:start position:0%
it it often will feel like you're
 
06:17:41.990 --> 06:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
getting criminalized when you're getting
 
06:17:42.000 --> 06:17:43.190 align:start position:0%
getting criminalized when you're getting
evicted

06:17:43.190 --> 06:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
evicted
 
06:17:43.200 --> 06:17:44.448 align:start position:0%
evicted
so

06:17:44.448 --> 06:17:44.458 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:17:48.048 --> 06:17:48.058 align:start position:0%
um that's what one of the reasons why I
 
06:17:49.788 --> 06:17:49.798 align:start position:0%
think it's important for
 
06:17:53.750 --> 06:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh tenants to have counsel
 
06:17:53.760 --> 06:17:54.350 align:start position:0%
uh tenants to have counsel
um

06:17:54.350 --> 06:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:57.170 --> 06:17:57.180 align:start position:0%
so and then also
 
06:18:00.410 --> 06:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
um to address a point about
 
06:18:02.510 --> 06:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh Federal funding
 
06:18:02.520 --> 06:18:03.650 align:start position:0%
uh Federal funding
um

06:18:03.650 --> 06:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:06.288 --> 06:18:06.298 align:start position:0%
about why the money can't just go to New
 
06:18:08.628 --> 06:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal aid specifically
 
06:18:10.850 --> 06:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:18:14.030 --> 06:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not entirely sure about process
 
06:18:15.410 --> 06:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
here since
 
06:18:15.420 --> 06:18:16.128 align:start position:0%
here since
um

06:18:16.128 --> 06:18:16.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:19.430 --> 06:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government changes their
 
06:18:21.470 --> 06:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
budgeting procedure every term it seems
 
06:18:23.810 --> 06:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
like but to me it sounds like that would
 
06:18:23.820 --> 06:18:25.670 align:start position:0%
like but to me it sounds like that would
be

06:18:25.670 --> 06:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:18:30.110 --> 06:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
um what's referred to as earmarks which
 
06:18:34.070 --> 06:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
um or t is the fancy terminology that
 
06:18:36.890 --> 06:18:36.900 align:start position:0%
um Congressional offices will sometimes
 
06:18:38.930 --> 06:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
put out I think they use the term
 
06:18:42.890 --> 06:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
constituent directed funding request
 
06:18:42.900 --> 06:18:43.850 align:start position:0%
constituent directed funding request
um

06:18:43.850 --> 06:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:47.208 --> 06:18:47.218 align:start position:0%
and whether or not earmarks are allowed
 
06:18:48.530 --> 06:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
is something
 
06:18:50.930 --> 06:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
that um
 
06:18:50.940 --> 06:18:52.850 align:start position:0%
that um
keeps

06:18:52.850 --> 06:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
keeps
 
06:18:55.430 --> 06:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
changing depending on
 
06:18:58.310 --> 06:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
what the federal rules committee decides
 
06:19:00.650 --> 06:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
and they're only just getting organized
 
06:19:02.810 --> 06:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
now after
 
06:19:02.820 --> 06:19:04.070 align:start position:0%
now after
um

06:19:04.070 --> 06:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:07.990 --> 06:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
some confusion asked as to how exactly
 
06:19:09.708 --> 06:19:09.718 align:start position:0%
this Federal
 
06:19:12.410 --> 06:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
um this town's Federal Congress
 
06:19:15.288 --> 06:19:15.298 align:start position:0%
is going to be organized so
 
06:19:15.298 --> 06:19:16.490 align:start position:0%
is going to be organized so
um

06:19:16.490 --> 06:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:18.890 --> 06:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
whether or not it is actually possible
 
06:19:21.708 --> 06:19:21.718 align:start position:0%
for the money to go directly to New
 
06:19:23.208 --> 06:19:23.218 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legally
 
06:19:25.690 --> 06:19:25.700 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think
 
06:19:27.948 --> 06:19:27.958 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
06:19:30.170 --> 06:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
question that we have a certain answer
 
06:19:32.090 --> 06:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
to yet
 
06:19:32.100 --> 06:19:33.708 align:start position:0%
to yet
um

06:19:33.708 --> 06:19:33.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:36.650 --> 06:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
but it is true that
 
06:19:40.128 --> 06:19:40.138 align:start position:0%
there is supposed to be Federal support
 
06:19:43.190 --> 06:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
for this General principle I haven't
 
06:19:46.850 --> 06:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
spoken to Senator Hassan's office myself
 
06:19:50.270 --> 06:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
about this but I have seen just
 
06:19:53.208 --> 06:19:53.218 align:start position:0%
from the news that um the buy-in
 
06:19:53.218 --> 06:19:54.610 align:start position:0%
from the news that um the buy-in
Administration

06:19:54.610 --> 06:19:54.620 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
06:19:54.620 --> 06:19:56.948 align:start position:0%
Administration
recently

06:19:56.948 --> 06:19:56.958 align:start position:0%
recently
 
06:20:00.548 --> 06:20:00.558 align:start position:0%
announced a set of
 
06:20:02.868 --> 06:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
principles for
 
06:20:07.310 --> 06:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
renters included a right to council and
 
06:20:09.350 --> 06:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
eviction proceedings
 
06:20:12.708 --> 06:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
among them so um
 
06:20:14.930 --> 06:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
that's a sign that the federal
 
06:20:16.970 --> 06:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
government would back us up on this but
 
06:20:19.430 --> 06:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
the reason why
 
06:20:21.708 --> 06:20:21.718 align:start position:0%
I think we should do this through state
 
06:20:21.718 --> 06:20:22.970 align:start position:0%
I think we should do this through state
level

06:20:22.970 --> 06:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
level
 
06:20:25.788 --> 06:20:25.798 align:start position:0%
legislation rather than just depending
 
06:20:30.650 --> 06:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
on the federal rulemaking is because
 
06:20:33.708 --> 06:20:33.718 align:start position:0%
um well Federal Executive Branch rope
 
06:20:36.470 --> 06:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
making isn't quite as permanent it can
 
06:20:39.770 --> 06:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
change with administrations and
 
06:20:39.780 --> 06:20:40.788 align:start position:0%
change with administrations and
um

06:20:40.788 --> 06:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:44.270 --> 06:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
I think just showing that we have that
 
06:20:45.650 --> 06:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
same commitment
 
06:20:48.590 --> 06:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
to that principle on the um
 
06:20:50.930 --> 06:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
at the state level here too would just
 
06:20:53.510 --> 06:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
give tenants in
 
06:20:59.030 --> 06:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
this state a greater sense of security
 
06:21:02.448 --> 06:21:02.458 align:start position:0%
um and would be helpful for them
 
06:21:02.458 --> 06:21:03.770 align:start position:0%
um and would be helpful for them
um

06:21:03.770 --> 06:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:03.780 --> 06:21:05.628 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:21:05.628 --> 06:21:05.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:21:08.330 --> 06:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
uh yeah that's why
 
06:21:10.548 --> 06:21:10.558 align:start position:0%
or though that's what I have to say
 
06:21:11.990 --> 06:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
about this bill
 
06:21:13.548 --> 06:21:13.558 align:start position:0%
um and I'll take any questions questions
 
06:21:16.128 --> 06:21:16.138 align:start position:0%
for this week
 
06:21:18.010 --> 06:21:18.020 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir
 
06:21:33.490 --> 06:21:33.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:36.890 --> 06:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
there we go hi uh Brandon Lemay from
 
06:21:40.010 --> 06:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire uh speaking in
 
06:21:43.910 --> 06:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 379. uh yeah I
 
06:21:45.170 --> 06:21:45.180 align:start position:0%
just want to be really brief once again
 
06:21:46.670 --> 06:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
here because you are going to hear me
 
06:21:48.890 --> 06:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
for one more bill today
 
06:21:48.900 --> 06:21:49.868 align:start position:0%
for one more bill today
um

06:21:49.868 --> 06:21:49.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:54.548 --> 06:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
I see this bill as primarily
 
06:21:58.548 --> 06:21:58.558 align:start position:0%
defending those that are of the lowest
 
06:22:00.650 --> 06:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
income think of those who are disabled
 
06:22:04.368 --> 06:22:04.378 align:start position:0%
think of those who are elderly those who
 
06:22:06.730 --> 06:22:06.740 align:start position:0%
are working multiple jobs with children
 
06:22:10.250 --> 06:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
and then throw them an eviction notice
 
06:22:13.070 --> 06:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
and expect them to understand what a
 
06:22:15.048 --> 06:22:15.058 align:start position:0%
discovery period is
 
06:22:18.708 --> 06:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
ask them to know what is and isn't okay
 
06:22:20.750 --> 06:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
to say in front of a judge it's just not
 
06:22:23.030 --> 06:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
something that the average person
 
06:22:25.250 --> 06:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
I can really comprehend without many
 
06:22:27.170 --> 06:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
years of law school behind them
 
06:22:31.310 --> 06:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
so I see this bill as just leveling the
 
06:22:34.610 --> 06:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
playing field and it's making sure that
 
06:22:37.430 --> 06:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
regular people are protected through a
 
06:22:39.230 --> 06:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
very complicated process which is
 
06:22:42.170 --> 06:22:42.180 align:start position:0%
landlord-tenant law I have been an
 
06:22:44.990 --> 06:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
advocate for low and middle-income
 
06:22:47.090 --> 06:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
renters for a couple of uh two years now
 
06:22:50.270 --> 06:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
almost three and I can tell you I still
 
06:22:51.650 --> 06:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
don't understand many of the legal
 
06:22:54.350 --> 06:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
nuances that go into an eviction hearing
 
06:22:56.628 --> 06:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
and when we consider just how important
 
06:22:59.330 --> 06:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
housing is I believe that adding the
 
06:23:00.890 --> 06:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
right to defend yourself in front of a
 
06:23:03.230 --> 06:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
judge and to have qualified legal
 
06:23:05.510 --> 06:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
representation is Paramount to being
 
06:23:08.150 --> 06:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
able to be in a functional member of
 
06:23:10.548 --> 06:23:10.558 align:start position:0%
society quite frankly
 
06:23:12.830 --> 06:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
um so I'll keep the short uh and I'll
 
06:23:14.628 --> 06:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
open up to any questions questions for
 
06:23:16.548 --> 06:23:16.558 align:start position:0%
this wish
 
06:23:18.530 --> 06:23:18.540 align:start position:0%
ing none thank you very much sir thank
 
06:23:20.090 --> 06:23:20.100 align:start position:0%

ask I think we don't have a pink card on

this bill don't I mean when you get to
 
06:23:25.910 --> 06:23:25.920 align:start position:0%

06:23:56.628 --> 06:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill as a concept I'm
 
06:23:58.490 --> 06:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
mostly here to talk about the fact that
 
06:24:03.350 --> 06:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
I among other nhli nhla Advocates have
 
06:24:05.390 --> 06:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
been working in the courts the last
 
06:24:07.430 --> 06:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
couple of years not for the courts but
 
06:24:09.470 --> 06:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
at the courthouses in Manchester and
 
06:24:12.590 --> 06:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
Nashua doing eviction clinics I think
 
06:24:14.990 --> 06:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
I've done about 75 myself where we show
 
06:24:18.350 --> 06:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
up and meet tenants for the first time
 
06:24:20.570 --> 06:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
look at their files talk to them about
 
06:24:23.270 --> 06:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
what's happening and talk them through
 
06:24:25.670 --> 06:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
you know what their legal defenses might
 
06:24:27.890 --> 06:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
be but we also help them Reach
 
06:24:29.868 --> 06:24:29.878 align:start position:0%
agreements with their landlords so a lot
 
06:24:32.510 --> 06:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
of times the landlord and the tenant in
 
06:24:34.190 --> 06:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
the in the situations that we see I'm
 
06:24:36.350 --> 06:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
not saying this is always the case but
 
06:24:38.448 --> 06:24:38.458 align:start position:0%
are frustrated with one another aren't
 
06:24:40.250 --> 06:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
able to communicate effectively don't
 
06:24:42.230 --> 06:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
want to listen to one another and it
 
06:24:45.470 --> 06:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
really helps to have someone step in and
 
06:24:48.110 --> 06:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
be able to calmly talk through things in
 
06:24:49.850 --> 06:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
a rational way explain to the tenant
 
06:24:52.128 --> 06:24:52.138 align:start position:0%
what their rights are explain what the
 
06:24:55.128 --> 06:24:55.138 align:start position:0%
law is help them try and negotiate with
 
06:24:57.470 --> 06:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
their landlord oftentimes we're able to
 
06:24:59.628 --> 06:24:59.638 align:start position:0%
get an agreement reached before an
 
06:25:01.610 --> 06:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
eviction judgment is issued against a
 
06:25:04.548 --> 06:25:04.558 align:start position:0%
tenant yes an eviction being filed in
 
06:25:06.288 --> 06:25:06.298 align:start position:0%
the court still shows up in the landlord
 
06:25:07.850 --> 06:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
Reporting System but there's no judgment
 
06:25:09.770 --> 06:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
on the person's record if they reach an
 
06:25:11.750 --> 06:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
agreement and submit that through the
 
06:25:15.830 --> 06:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
courts and and follow it so nhla does
 
06:25:17.830 --> 06:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
support the concept of right to counsel
 
06:25:20.628 --> 06:25:20.638 align:start position:0%
I just realized I didn't hand out but I
 
06:25:26.810 --> 06:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:29.030 --> 06:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh letters from the National Coalition
 
06:25:31.610 --> 06:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
for civil right to council that they
 
06:25:35.150 --> 06:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
support uh the right to council and
 
06:25:37.490 --> 06:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
eviction proceedings as well I'm happy
 
06:25:39.170 --> 06:25:39.180 align:start position:0%
to answer questions about kind of what
 
06:25:40.970 --> 06:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
it's like and how it helps having
 
06:25:44.330 --> 06:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
someone there uh at an eviction case and
 
06:25:45.890 --> 06:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
working through that process with the
 
06:25:47.990 --> 06:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
tenant and a landlord
 
06:25:51.470 --> 06:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:53.448 --> 06:25:53.458 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
06:26:01.490 --> 06:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:01.500 --> 06:26:08.510 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:26:08.510 --> 06:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:10.368 --> 06:26:10.378 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Jessica
 
06:26:12.048 --> 06:26:12.058 align:start position:0%
marjason again with Granite State
 
06:26:13.810 --> 06:26:13.820 align:start position:0%
organizing project
 
06:26:16.970 --> 06:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
I am here and I support this bill my
 
06:26:16.980 --> 06:26:17.890 align:start position:0%
I am here and I support this bill my
work

06:26:17.890 --> 06:26:17.900 align:start position:0%
work
 
06:26:20.890 --> 06:26:20.900 align:start position:0%
as I've stated before and I'll state for
 
06:26:23.690 --> 06:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
clarification now I have a tenant Clinic
 
06:26:26.270 --> 06:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
that I run weekly I'm missing it to be
 
06:26:28.128 --> 06:26:28.138 align:start position:0%
here today it's normally Wednesdays from
 
06:26:29.810 --> 06:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
one to four
 
06:26:29.820 --> 06:26:30.650 align:start position:0%
one to four
um

06:26:30.650 --> 06:26:30.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:33.530 --> 06:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
and during this I see I get to be that
 
06:26:35.270 --> 06:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
person in the middle of the tenants and
 
06:26:37.850 --> 06:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
nhla because when they come into the
 
06:26:40.190 --> 06:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
clinic I help them find some rental
 
06:26:41.868 --> 06:26:41.878 align:start position:0%
assistance they may need I help them
 
06:26:43.368 --> 06:26:43.378 align:start position:0%
learn their rights and I also help
 
06:26:45.470 --> 06:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
direct them to free legal assistance
 
06:26:47.510 --> 06:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
teach them how to sign up and go about
 
06:26:50.390 --> 06:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
that what I do run into unfortunately
 
06:26:53.090 --> 06:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
and why this bill is so important is
 
06:26:55.730 --> 06:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
nhla is the only free legal help we have
 
06:26:58.310 --> 06:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
in our state currently they are very
 
06:27:02.930 --> 06:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
very busy and due to that sometimes
 
06:27:02.940 --> 06:27:03.530 align:start position:0%
very busy and due to that sometimes
um

06:27:03.530 --> 06:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:05.930 --> 06:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
people want questions right away or
 
06:27:08.448 --> 06:27:08.458 align:start position:0%
they'll fall through a crack but one big
 
06:27:10.250 --> 06:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
thing that happens is a conflict of
 
06:27:12.128 --> 06:27:12.138 align:start position:0%
interest because they are the only
 
06:27:14.690 --> 06:27:14.700 align:start position:0%
organization that does this sometimes a
 
06:27:18.948 --> 06:27:18.958 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest will exist in there
 
06:27:21.230 --> 06:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
to where that tenant can then not get
 
06:27:23.690 --> 06:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
free legal assistance so there are a
 
06:27:26.150 --> 06:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
portion of tenants in our state that
 
06:27:28.250 --> 06:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
would benefit from this who couldn't
 
06:27:30.470 --> 06:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
benefit from the current the way it is
 
06:27:32.868 --> 06:27:32.878 align:start position:0%
so if they had representation and they
 
06:27:34.850 --> 06:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
were able to get it elsewhere they could
 
06:27:37.610 --> 06:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
still then be covered um
 
06:27:40.010 --> 06:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know why certain ones exist but
 
06:27:41.628 --> 06:27:41.638 align:start position:0%
it's something within the company and
 
06:27:43.970 --> 06:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
the majority of the ones I do help with
 
06:27:46.368 --> 06:27:46.378 align:start position:0%
are able to get assistance luckily
 
06:27:49.490 --> 06:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
another reason is why it's so needed
 
06:27:51.410 --> 06:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
there is no safety net a lot of times
 
06:27:53.510 --> 06:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
people assume there's a safety net for
 
06:27:55.368 --> 06:27:55.378 align:start position:0%
those who are either elderly or disabled
 
06:27:57.948 --> 06:27:57.958 align:start position:0%
and there is no Universal safety net as
 
06:27:59.990 --> 06:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you've seen sir
 
06:28:02.628 --> 06:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
um for instance Michelle Marr who I
 
06:28:05.090 --> 06:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
watched nhla defend and core and keep
 
06:28:07.510 --> 06:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
housed had recently had brain surgery
 
06:28:10.070 --> 06:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
and her head was still healing as I
 
06:28:11.690 --> 06:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
watched in court as she sat in her
 
06:28:13.970 --> 06:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
wheelchair and the other lawyer tried so
 
06:28:17.208 --> 06:28:17.218 align:start position:0%
hard to get her unhoused so luckily she
 
06:28:18.890 --> 06:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
was able to stay house because of those
 
06:28:21.708 --> 06:28:21.718 align:start position:0%
services like I said no safety net Doris
 
06:28:23.990 --> 06:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
bomba who I was able to connect with
 
06:28:26.510 --> 06:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
them also because of no safety net he
 
06:28:26.520 --> 06:28:27.610 align:start position:0%
them also because of no safety net he
had

06:28:27.610 --> 06:28:27.620 align:start position:0%
had
 
06:28:30.530 --> 06:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
limited capacity so for him to
 
06:28:33.288 --> 06:28:33.298 align:start position:0%
understand what was going on and make
 
06:28:35.628 --> 06:28:35.638 align:start position:0%
his way through that the judge doesn't
 
06:28:38.628 --> 06:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
have time to sit there and say well
 
06:28:40.730 --> 06:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
you don't seem to understand what's
 
06:28:42.830 --> 06:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
going on let's do this instead that's
 
06:28:46.788 --> 06:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
not his role then so having nhla there
 
06:28:49.610 --> 06:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
to be able to help them is huge
 
06:28:52.430 --> 06:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
um so this bill is big and one thing I
 
06:28:53.868 --> 06:28:53.878 align:start position:0%
did notice on it when reading through
 
06:28:56.030 --> 06:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
the paperwork is
 
06:28:56.040 --> 06:28:56.990 align:start position:0%
the paperwork is
um

06:28:56.990 --> 06:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:01.128 --> 06:29:01.138 align:start position:0%
page three oh it's labeled page two but
 
06:29:03.770 --> 06:29:03.780 align:start position:0%
line one and two authorized to draw a
 
06:29:05.690 --> 06:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
warrant from said some out of any money
 
06:29:07.010 --> 06:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
in the treasury not otherwise
 
06:29:09.530 --> 06:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
appropriated would this then be similar
 
06:29:11.930 --> 06:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
to how City Welfare operates that when
 
06:29:14.030 --> 06:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
their bucket runs dry it can be
 
06:29:14.040 --> 06:29:16.010 align:start position:0%
their bucket runs dry it can be
replenished

06:29:16.010 --> 06:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
replenished
 
06:29:19.070 --> 06:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
and that's I had a question on that
 
06:29:22.730 --> 06:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
right questions for this Witness
 
06:29:25.128 --> 06:29:25.138 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez
 
06:29:27.470 --> 06:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
question would anybody be opposed to
 
06:29:29.810 --> 06:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
since it appears there seems to be two
 
06:29:32.990 --> 06:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
or even more mediation groups out there
 
06:29:36.110 --> 06:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
working would anybody be opposed perhaps
 
06:29:40.368 --> 06:29:40.378 align:start position:0%
to adding into this if mediation is not
 
06:29:42.470 --> 06:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
able to be work because it appears we
 
06:29:45.048 --> 06:29:45.058 align:start position:0%
have a bill that mediation is working we
 
06:29:47.030 --> 06:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
also have testimony that other mediation
 
06:29:49.250 --> 06:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
is working
 
06:29:53.090 --> 06:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
would anybody be opposed to having part
 
06:29:55.548 --> 06:29:55.558 align:start position:0%
of this say that if mediation is not
 
06:29:59.208 --> 06:29:59.218 align:start position:0%
able to be reached that's a good idea so
 
06:30:00.530 --> 06:30:00.540 align:start position:0%
that people aren't just saying well I
 
06:30:01.910 --> 06:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to go through mediation I can
 
06:30:04.430 --> 06:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
get a lawyer just a thought it is a good
 
06:30:07.128 --> 06:30:07.138 align:start position:0%
idea because uh mediation is a choice
 
06:30:09.110 --> 06:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
you don't have to go through so if both
 
06:30:11.448 --> 06:30:11.458 align:start position:0%
parties don't want to go
 
06:30:13.070 --> 06:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
um so say the tenant did want to go to
 
06:30:16.548 --> 06:30:16.558 align:start position:0%
mediation which would be a cost saver
 
06:30:19.730 --> 06:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
um and the landlord says absolutely not
 
06:30:21.708 --> 06:30:21.718 align:start position:0%
um that would be another reason it would
 
06:30:23.448 --> 06:30:23.458 align:start position:0%
be good for it another thing too I
 
06:30:25.190 --> 06:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
almost didn't mention is that in the
 
06:30:26.890 --> 06:30:26.900 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire it's a
 
06:30:29.208 --> 06:30:29.218 align:start position:0%
discrimination women and women with
 
06:30:31.010 --> 06:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
children are more likely than men or men
 
06:30:33.770 --> 06:30:33.780 align:start position:0%
with children to be given evictions
 
06:30:36.890 --> 06:30:36.900 align:start position:0%
um so that's another big reason because
 
06:30:38.930 --> 06:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
of that discrepancy existing and
 
06:30:41.448 --> 06:30:41.458 align:start position:0%
mediation like as you said the
 
06:30:43.010 --> 06:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
communication sometimes breaks down
 
06:30:44.690 --> 06:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
between landlords and tenants over
 
06:30:46.910 --> 06:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
arguing and sometimes they do need that
 
06:30:48.650 --> 06:30:48.660 align:start position:0%
person there just to start the
 
06:30:50.410 --> 06:30:50.420 align:start position:0%
communication again
 
06:30:52.670 --> 06:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
putting some money into keeping people
 
06:30:55.310 --> 06:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
housed also is another way to save money
 
06:30:56.930 --> 06:30:56.940 align:start position:0%
because if we don't keep them housed
 
06:30:58.128 --> 06:30:58.138 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to pay for them to
 
06:31:00.350 --> 06:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
be housed and it's a lot more expensive
 
06:31:02.330 --> 06:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
monthly like at the hotels right now
 
06:31:04.368 --> 06:31:04.378 align:start position:0%
it's five thousand dollars a month to
 
06:31:06.708 --> 06:31:06.718 align:start position:0%
house someone in a hotel where we could
 
06:31:09.170 --> 06:31:09.180 align:start position:0%
put them in an apartment for 1200 to
 
06:31:13.128 --> 06:31:13.138 align:start position:0%
1600 rent so keeping them housed saves
 
06:31:14.868 --> 06:31:14.878 align:start position:0%
US money down the road so if we have a
 
06:31:16.490 --> 06:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
little bit of money to throw to this it
 
06:31:18.470 --> 06:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
it will save us money all right
 
06:31:20.930 --> 06:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
06:31:23.150 --> 06:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much thank
 
06:31:33.288 --> 06:31:33.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:35.208 --> 06:31:35.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Chad good after Mr chairman
 
06:31:36.410 --> 06:31:36.420 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
06:31:38.150 --> 06:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
Richard head I'm the government Affairs
 
06:31:40.610 --> 06:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the judicial branch
 
06:31:44.628 --> 06:31:44.638 align:start position:0%
in general we support anything that can
 
06:31:48.590 --> 06:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
help any party whether it be a filing
 
06:31:51.170 --> 06:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
party or or defendant have legal
 
06:31:51.180 --> 06:31:53.090 align:start position:0%
party or or defendant have legal
representation

06:31:53.090 --> 06:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
representation
 
06:31:55.610 --> 06:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
um but the reality is in landlord tenant
 
06:31:58.548 --> 06:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
as in family as in a lot of of the areas
 
06:32:00.830 --> 06:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
of that that we see in the circuit
 
06:32:02.628 --> 06:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
courts there are a lot of unrepresented
 
06:32:02.638 --> 06:32:03.590 align:start position:0%
courts there are a lot of unrepresented
parties

06:32:03.590 --> 06:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
parties
 
06:32:06.410 --> 06:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
we do and we have taken a lot of steps
 
06:32:08.690 --> 06:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
to make courts more accessible to
 
06:32:10.970 --> 06:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
unrepresented parties
 
06:32:13.788 --> 06:32:13.798 align:start position:0%
um but it is clearly a a more efficient
 
06:32:16.190 --> 06:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
system if there are attorneys in in the
 
06:32:16.200 --> 06:32:17.570 align:start position:0%
system if there are attorneys in in the
system

06:32:17.570 --> 06:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:32:21.410 --> 06:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
one of the areas in in the uh
 
06:32:23.150 --> 06:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh in representative Reed had mentioned
 
06:32:25.250 --> 06:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
that you know I did talk with her this
 
06:32:27.230 --> 06:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
morning I there are a number of new
 
06:32:28.610 --> 06:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
members on the committee and I do want
 
06:32:30.110 --> 06:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
to clarify one thing that's a common
 
06:32:32.690 --> 06:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
source of confusion the judicial council
 
06:32:36.708 --> 06:32:36.718 align:start position:0%
is unrelated to the judicial branch the
 
06:32:38.930 --> 06:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
judicial council is an executive branch
 
06:32:38.940 --> 06:32:40.150 align:start position:0%
judicial council is an executive branch
agency

06:32:40.150 --> 06:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
agency
 
06:32:43.910 --> 06:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
that is the funding the The Source or
 
06:32:46.250 --> 06:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
receives the funding that ultimately is
 
06:32:49.310 --> 06:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
used to pay for uh engine Indigent
 
06:32:53.110 --> 06:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
criminal defense attorneys that is not
 
06:32:57.530 --> 06:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
managed through the judicial branch
 
06:33:00.890 --> 06:33:00.900 align:start position:0%
um what this bill would require is that
 
06:33:02.750 --> 06:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
for anyone who meets the definition of
 
06:33:05.868 --> 06:33:05.878 align:start position:0%
indigent in this bill whether it be in
 
06:33:07.610 --> 06:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
other bills low income it's called
 
06:33:10.430 --> 06:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
Indigent uh in this bill
 
06:33:13.368 --> 06:33:13.378 align:start position:0%
the concern is is
 
06:33:15.708 --> 06:33:15.718 align:start position:0%
what I think representative Reed said
 
06:33:17.868 --> 06:33:17.878 align:start position:0%
she was hoping to have created in in
 
06:33:20.270 --> 06:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
this bill which is a lack of structure
 
06:33:23.810 --> 06:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
so the the if we take the criminal world
 
06:33:27.368 --> 06:33:27.378 align:start position:0%
we have a robust structure around
 
06:33:30.110 --> 06:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
criminal defense lawyers we have a
 
06:33:32.390 --> 06:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
public defender system that is
 
06:33:34.970 --> 06:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
throughout the state when when the court
 
06:33:34.980 --> 06:33:37.070 align:start position:0%
throughout the state when when the court
uh

06:33:37.070 --> 06:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:33:39.410 --> 06:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
says that somebody is entitled to
 
06:33:41.990 --> 06:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
representation in the criminal world we
 
06:33:45.048 --> 06:33:45.058 align:start position:0%
do not pick the lawyer it is done
 
06:33:46.730 --> 06:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
through the public defender's office
 
06:33:49.368 --> 06:33:49.378 align:start position:0%
public defender then assigns that lawyer
 
06:33:51.470 --> 06:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
to the case and a lawyer is then
 
06:33:53.750 --> 06:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
representing that defendant
 
06:33:55.730 --> 06:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
this doesn't have that structure
 
06:33:58.970 --> 06:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
associated with it so we would
 
06:34:01.250 --> 06:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
appoint a lawyer
 
06:34:03.410 --> 06:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
unclear as to who that lawyer will be
 
06:34:05.990 --> 06:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
where that lawyer is coming from who's
 
06:34:08.090 --> 06:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
managing who's going to assign what
 
06:34:10.910 --> 06:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
lawyer to that case if it is New
 
06:34:13.128 --> 06:34:13.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance they're going
 
06:34:16.430 --> 06:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
to need a a much more robust system than
 
06:34:19.548 --> 06:34:19.558 align:start position:0%
what they have currently because just
 
06:34:21.590 --> 06:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
the sheer number of of potential
 
06:34:25.570 --> 06:34:25.580 align:start position:0%
appointments of attorneys that would be
 
06:34:27.830 --> 06:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
required through this through this bill
 
06:34:31.430 --> 06:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
so the the the sort of the lack of
 
06:34:33.830 --> 06:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
underlying structure that that
 
06:34:37.070 --> 06:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
that this bill does not fill creates a
 
06:34:39.650 --> 06:34:39.660 align:start position:0%
significant vacuum in terms of what
 
06:34:41.868 --> 06:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
would happen once a court appoints an
 
06:34:44.570 --> 06:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
attorney because there's not then a
 
06:34:46.910 --> 06:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
system to pick that up and say you know
 
06:34:48.770 --> 06:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
attorney Smith you're now assigned to
 
06:34:50.030 --> 06:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
this case
 
06:34:52.610 --> 06:34:52.620 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of of this
 
06:34:54.650 --> 06:34:54.660 align:start position:0%
um that again comes to the structure of
 
06:34:56.750 --> 06:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
it is
 
06:34:59.090 --> 06:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant cases happen very very
 
06:35:01.730 --> 06:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
fat quickly they they have very short
 
06:35:03.590 --> 06:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
deadlines from the date the case is
 
06:35:05.270 --> 06:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
filed to the date that there has to be a
 
06:35:07.310 --> 06:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
hearing I think although don't hold me
 
06:35:09.590 --> 06:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
to this is 10 days
 
06:35:13.490 --> 06:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
um so what has to happen in that time
 
06:35:14.930 --> 06:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
when that
 
06:35:17.270 --> 06:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
tenant files the appearance files the
 
06:35:20.628 --> 06:35:20.638 align:start position:0%
financial records is in very short order
 
06:35:24.650 --> 06:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
a lawyer has to be not only uh
 
06:35:27.948 --> 06:35:27.958 align:start position:0%
assigned but has to appear has to show
 
06:35:31.030 --> 06:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
up and has to sort of become involved
 
06:35:33.410 --> 06:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
legal assistance is very good at that
 
06:35:36.048 --> 06:35:36.058 align:start position:0%
for their clients but they don't have
 
06:35:38.448 --> 06:35:38.458 align:start position:0%
sort of this system in place to do it
 
06:35:40.850 --> 06:35:40.860 align:start position:0%
throughout the state for you know I
 
06:35:42.170 --> 06:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
don't know how many thousands of of
 
06:35:44.830 --> 06:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
individuals who would go through it so
 
06:35:47.868 --> 06:35:47.878 align:start position:0%
as written the bill doesn't provide any
 
06:35:49.910 --> 06:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
of that substance and we have a great
 
06:35:51.948 --> 06:35:51.958 align:start position:0%
deal of concern about that in talking
 
06:35:53.390 --> 06:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
with representative Reed this morning
 
06:35:56.150 --> 06:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
we're obviously happy to assist in in
 
06:35:58.310 --> 06:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
any in any way we can in terms of the
 
06:36:00.288 --> 06:36:00.298 align:start position:0%
legislation but as written
 
06:36:03.288 --> 06:36:03.298 align:start position:0%
we think that it it could it really
 
06:36:05.510 --> 06:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to be implemented just
 
06:36:08.150 --> 06:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
as a mechanics of of getting lawyers
 
06:36:10.788 --> 06:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
appointed getting a lawyer assigned to a
 
06:36:12.470 --> 06:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
case and getting the lawyer to appear
 
06:36:14.750 --> 06:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
and then show up in a courtroom within a
 
06:36:17.510 --> 06:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
very short window of time with that I
 
06:36:19.128 --> 06:36:19.138 align:start position:0%
would conclude my comments but would be
 
06:36:20.448 --> 06:36:20.458 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions questions
 
06:36:22.548 --> 06:36:22.558 align:start position:0%
for this Witness
 
06:36:25.190 --> 06:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative Manos thank you Mr
 
06:36:25.200 --> 06:36:26.390 align:start position:0%
yes representative Manos thank you Mr
Char

06:36:26.390 --> 06:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
Char
 
06:36:28.730 --> 06:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
um Mr head would the
 
06:36:31.128 --> 06:36:31.138 align:start position:0%
um would the administrative system also
 
06:36:33.530 --> 06:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
include the system for payment to
 
06:36:35.930 --> 06:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
council once the work is done so payment
 
06:36:39.170 --> 06:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
Council in this bill would be through
 
06:36:42.110 --> 06:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
the judicial Council not the judicial
 
06:36:44.750 --> 06:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
branch which is why the judicial Council
 
06:36:46.670 --> 06:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
put in the fiscal note that has the
 
06:36:50.150 --> 06:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:52.788 --> 06:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
06:36:54.890 --> 06:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Mr head thank you
 
06:36:56.990 --> 06:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time today
 
06:37:03.350 --> 06:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:05.030 --> 06:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
06:37:06.530 --> 06:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
committee my name is David Klein I know
 
06:37:08.690 --> 06:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
you're probably sick of hearing from me
 
06:37:11.510 --> 06:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
um just want to start off with if a
 
06:37:13.730 --> 06:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
proposing counsel appears in an eviction
 
06:37:15.530 --> 06:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
I've had it happen a couple of times I
 
06:37:17.270 --> 06:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
have no problem with it the comment that
 
06:37:19.190 --> 06:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
we don't want them represented is not
 
06:37:21.590 --> 06:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
true those cases actually go through
 
06:37:24.048 --> 06:37:24.058 align:start position:0%
easier because someone it does explain
 
06:37:26.570 --> 06:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
to the defendant where the defendant
 
06:37:28.128 --> 06:37:28.138 align:start position:0%
doesn't know what they're talking about
 
06:37:29.690 --> 06:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
and that happens a lot in land
 
06:37:31.788 --> 06:37:31.798 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant cases
 
06:37:31.798 --> 06:37:32.510 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant cases
um

06:37:32.510 --> 06:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:35.030 --> 06:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh just briefly all evictions in New
 
06:37:37.010 --> 06:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have to be done exactly
 
06:37:39.410 --> 06:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
according to RSA 540. there are
 
06:37:41.868 --> 06:37:41.878 align:start position:0%
deadlines time limits all those have to
 
06:37:43.850 --> 06:37:43.860 align:start position:0%
be followed every eviction I've ever
 
06:37:46.010 --> 06:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
been involved with in Circuit Court the
 
06:37:47.628 --> 06:37:47.638 align:start position:0%
judge makes sure that all those
 
06:37:50.030 --> 06:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
deadlines are met properly if you don't
 
06:37:52.548 --> 06:37:52.558 align:start position:0%
serve if it's a 30-day eviction and you
 
06:37:55.128 --> 06:37:55.138 align:start position:0%
serve 29 days you're thrown out seven
 
06:37:56.990 --> 06:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
days and you don't have the full seven
 
06:38:00.128 --> 06:38:00.138 align:start position:0%
days you're thrown out
 
06:38:02.570 --> 06:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
and many of the judges are actually
 
06:38:05.570 --> 06:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
pushing us to go to go to agreements I
 
06:38:08.030 --> 06:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
had the last eviction I had the judge
 
06:38:09.708 --> 06:38:09.718 align:start position:0%
basically said why don't you go outside
 
06:38:12.110 --> 06:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
and talk about it it was clear and she
 
06:38:14.690 --> 06:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
said she indicated that I I was all
 
06:38:17.270 --> 06:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
right but there was a discretionary stay
 
06:38:18.890 --> 06:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
right now in the law of up to two months
 
06:38:21.830 --> 06:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
and she wanted us to use part of it and
 
06:38:24.470 --> 06:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
also not get give judgment to the ten if
 
06:38:26.330 --> 06:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
the tenant was willing to move out in
 
06:38:27.470 --> 06:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
order so that she wouldn't have an
 
06:38:29.570 --> 06:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
eviction on a record just the filing not
 
06:38:31.788 --> 06:38:31.798 align:start position:0%
the uh judgment
 
06:38:34.250 --> 06:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
most evictions are as was testified
 
06:38:36.288 --> 06:38:36.298 align:start position:0%
before they're not for non-payment of
 
06:38:38.810 --> 06:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
rent there isn't any real defense to
 
06:38:41.690 --> 06:38:41.700 align:start position:0%
most of those cases there are a few but
 
06:38:43.310 --> 06:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
that most of them people just don't have
 
06:38:46.010 --> 06:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
the money so now it's down to how long
 
06:38:47.690 --> 06:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
they're going to be there
 
06:38:49.788 --> 06:38:49.798 align:start position:0%
and that becomes the appointed attorney
 
06:38:53.090 --> 06:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
will basically be negotiating a move out
 
06:38:55.190 --> 06:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
date which the judges are pushing for a
 
06:38:56.810 --> 06:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
negotiated settlement
 
06:38:59.810 --> 06:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
that same thing incidentally happens in
 
06:39:02.628 --> 06:39:02.638 align:start position:0%
mediation the mediator will sit down and
 
06:39:04.430 --> 06:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
talk about the rights and we already
 
06:39:06.708 --> 06:39:06.718 align:start position:0%
have that program in existence and in
 
06:39:08.930 --> 06:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
fact we had a bill earlier to have the
 
06:39:11.750 --> 06:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
study committee so
 
06:39:14.390 --> 06:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
my opinion is the Indigent defense
 
06:39:16.430 --> 06:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
Council will not be that helpful to the
 
06:39:18.650 --> 06:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
defendant now if we expand the mediation
 
06:39:18.660 --> 06:39:20.690 align:start position:0%
defendant now if we expand the mediation
program

06:39:20.690 --> 06:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:39:23.270 --> 06:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
and the the funding issues I don't I
 
06:39:25.070 --> 06:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
don't have the quality to speak to but I
 
06:39:27.110 --> 06:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
do want to start that it feels like this
 
06:39:29.270 --> 06:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
bill starts to slippery slope
 
06:39:31.548 --> 06:39:31.558 align:start position:0%
currently only Indigent defendants and
 
06:39:33.530 --> 06:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
criminal actions when this possibility
 
06:39:35.690 --> 06:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
of going to jail incarceration are
 
06:39:37.910 --> 06:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
entitled to appointed counsel
 
06:39:39.890 --> 06:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
but this bill for the first time is
 
06:39:42.530 --> 06:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
going to appoint counsel in a civil case
 
06:39:45.350 --> 06:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
and then the question is what's next do
 
06:39:46.910 --> 06:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
we appoint counsel for first defense
 
06:39:48.948 --> 06:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
driving Under the Influence there's no
 
06:39:50.510 --> 06:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
jail time so they're not entitled to it
 
06:39:52.730 --> 06:39:52.740 align:start position:0%
now but you get one of those you can
 
06:39:54.470 --> 06:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
lose your job you can lose your housing
 
06:39:56.628 --> 06:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
you can lose your marriage
 
06:39:58.730 --> 06:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
it's also devastating
 
06:40:00.410 --> 06:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
another what about plaintiffs of
 
06:40:02.570 --> 06:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
defendants and domestic violence cases
 
06:40:04.190 --> 06:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
as we heard earlier this morning someone
 
06:40:05.810 --> 06:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
can get badly hurt
 
06:40:08.030 --> 06:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
does it is the victim entitled to a
 
06:40:10.190 --> 06:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
appointed Council there so how much do
 
06:40:11.868 --> 06:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
we want to spend how far do we want to
 
06:40:14.930 --> 06:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
go where do we draw the line
 
06:40:16.788 --> 06:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to propose and throw it
 
06:40:18.230 --> 06:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
out to the community to discuss when
 
06:40:20.090 --> 06:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
you're executing are we better off
 
06:40:22.310 --> 06:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
funding more mediation with these
 
06:40:23.868 --> 06:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
federal funds if we can get them or we
 
06:40:25.788 --> 06:40:25.798 align:start position:0%
better off with Indigent Council I think
 
06:40:28.610 --> 06:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
mediation would be a better option
 
06:40:30.470 --> 06:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attention thank you
 
06:40:33.470 --> 06:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
06:40:35.990 --> 06:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
06:40:40.190 --> 06:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:42.590 --> 06:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chairman for the
 
06:40:44.030 --> 06:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak I don't think
 
06:40:45.890 --> 06:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
there's much more for me to say that
 
06:40:49.250 --> 06:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
hasn't already been said
 
06:40:51.590 --> 06:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
um we think that this is very redundant
 
06:40:53.930 --> 06:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
to Legal Aid Services that are already
 
06:40:55.128 --> 06:40:55.138 align:start position:0%
in place
 
06:40:58.310 --> 06:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
Dennis already get legal aid services so
 
06:41:00.430 --> 06:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
I agree with whatever was said earlier
 
06:41:04.310 --> 06:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
from the front assistant chair or chair
 
06:41:05.990 --> 06:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
that said we could just have Federal
 
06:41:08.330 --> 06:41:08.340 align:start position:0%
moneys go to Legal Aid
 
06:41:12.128 --> 06:41:12.138 align:start position:0%
we don't need a different structure
 
06:41:15.128 --> 06:41:15.138 align:start position:0%
most cases definitely
 
06:41:17.270 --> 06:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly are for non-payment
 
06:41:19.610 --> 06:41:19.620 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to defend in a
 
06:41:21.830 --> 06:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
non-payment case did you pay the rent or
 
06:41:21.840 --> 06:41:22.548 align:start position:0%
non-payment case did you pay the rent or
not

06:41:22.548 --> 06:41:22.558 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:41:25.368 --> 06:41:25.378 align:start position:0%
so I mean why are we will we be paying
 
06:41:27.048 --> 06:41:27.058 align:start position:0%
for the expense of an attorney for
 
06:41:29.510 --> 06:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
06:41:29.520 --> 06:41:30.770 align:start position:0%
something like that
um

06:41:30.770 --> 06:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:41:33.288 --> 06:41:33.298 align:start position:0%
I heard something about discrimination
 
06:41:36.170 --> 06:41:36.180 align:start position:0%
of favoring I heard something about
 
06:41:38.690 --> 06:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
discrimination of favoring and I don't
 
06:41:41.208 --> 06:41:41.218 align:start position:0%
know which way it was excuse me sir you
 
06:41:43.310 --> 06:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
need to you need to be in the back okay
 
06:41:47.030 --> 06:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you men or women in eviction cases
 
06:41:49.850 --> 06:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
I I'm definitely in touch with many many
 
06:41:51.708 --> 06:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
landlords across the state I have never
 
06:41:54.230 --> 06:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
heard of such a thing I don't know where
 
06:41:56.150 --> 06:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's coming from at all I don't see
 
06:41:57.708 --> 06:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
any discrimination
 
06:42:01.010 --> 06:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
of men or women with children one over
 
06:42:02.930 --> 06:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
the other
 
06:42:02.940 --> 06:42:03.708 align:start position:0%
the other
um

06:42:03.708 --> 06:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:06.110 --> 06:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
so I I don't really have any other new
 
06:42:07.910 --> 06:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
comments I would happily take any
 
06:42:07.920 --> 06:42:10.430 align:start position:0%
comments I would happily take any
questions

06:42:10.430 --> 06:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:13.128 --> 06:42:13.138 align:start position:0%
for this Witness
 
06:42:16.368 --> 06:42:16.378 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir
 
06:42:20.150 --> 06:42:20.160 align:start position:0%

06:42:24.890 --> 06:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:26.510 --> 06:42:26.520 align:start position:0%

Stratford County District 10. of course
 
06:43:09.770 --> 06:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
that includes the University of New
 
06:43:09.780 --> 06:43:10.610 align:start position:0%
that includes the University of New
Hampshire

06:43:10.610 --> 06:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:43:11.868 --> 06:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
um I apologize for not being here
 
06:43:13.310 --> 06:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
earlier Wednesdays and Mondays I'm
 
06:43:15.048 --> 06:43:15.058 align:start position:0%
trying to juggle classes at law school
 
06:43:17.390 --> 06:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
and committee but I'm happy to be here
 
06:43:21.708 --> 06:43:21.718 align:start position:0%
now to present a house bill 401.
 
06:43:25.250 --> 06:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
so I'll briefly walk through the bill uh
 
06:43:28.250 --> 06:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
with you all uh it's regarding standards
 
06:43:31.070 --> 06:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
on an owner's intent to renovate or
 
06:43:33.230 --> 06:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
remove property uh from the residential
 
06:43:33.240 --> 06:43:34.430 align:start position:0%
remove property uh from the residential
Market

06:43:34.430 --> 06:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
Market
 
06:43:38.868 --> 06:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
so it adds a second section to RSA 540.
 
06:43:41.330 --> 06:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
um I will begin
 
06:43:44.090 --> 06:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
by pointing out that uh page one line
 
06:43:47.330 --> 06:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
five offers an exception
 
06:43:47.340 --> 06:43:48.170 align:start position:0%
five offers an exception
um

06:43:48.170 --> 06:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:51.708 --> 06:43:51.718 align:start position:0%
talking about section f
 
06:43:55.270 --> 06:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh that section regards lead exposure so
 
06:43:58.190 --> 06:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
in those situations uh this bill is not
 
06:43:58.200 --> 06:43:59.270 align:start position:0%
in those situations uh this bill is not
relevant

06:43:59.270 --> 06:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
06:44:01.670 --> 06:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
um page one line five through nine
 
06:44:04.070 --> 06:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
offers two elements that an eviction
 
06:44:06.530 --> 06:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
notice must have uh when there is an
 
06:44:09.048 --> 06:44:09.058 align:start position:0%
intent to renovate the first is 60 days
 
06:44:11.690 --> 06:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
notice uh to vacate
 
06:44:14.390 --> 06:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
and second is to specify the work and
 
06:44:16.548 --> 06:44:16.558 align:start position:0%
time frame of the renovations
 
06:44:18.110 --> 06:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
um some questions you may have
 
06:44:22.010 --> 06:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
is why 60 days it takes time to find a
 
06:44:24.410 --> 06:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
spot so we doubled from what is current
 
06:44:26.690 --> 06:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
law which is 30 days
 
06:44:29.390 --> 06:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
um so I know there's been comments from
 
06:44:31.850 --> 06:44:31.860 align:start position:0%
the committee that reasonableness is an
 
06:44:33.470 --> 06:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
aggravating term I'm in law school I
 
06:44:34.970 --> 06:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
know but it is in the realm of
 
06:44:39.470 --> 06:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:43.190 --> 06:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
um then I'll move to page one line let's
 
06:44:45.410 --> 06:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
see 11 through 18 which offers three
 
06:44:48.770 --> 06:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
elements that an owner must establish to
 
06:44:50.868 --> 06:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
Prevail at uh the hearing
 
06:44:53.510 --> 06:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's one uh that the work cannot
 
06:44:54.650 --> 06:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
happen while
 
06:44:57.770 --> 06:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
the unit is occupied two that the work
 
06:45:00.830 --> 06:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
will take more than 30 days
 
06:45:03.830 --> 06:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
and third uh that the tenant is offered
 
06:45:05.208 --> 06:45:05.218 align:start position:0%
to dwell in with the same number of
 
06:45:08.410 --> 06:45:08.420 align:start position:0%
bedrooms that doesn't exceed uh the rent
 
06:45:13.250 --> 06:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
so why 30 days uh it's you it's using
 
06:45:17.150 --> 06:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
the under current law RSA 130 uh a which
 
06:45:19.430 --> 06:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
provides 30 days in situations due to
 
06:45:21.230 --> 06:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
lead hazards so that's where that number
 
06:45:22.670 --> 06:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
came from just trying to keep it
 
06:45:25.850 --> 06:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
applicable to uh current law
 
06:45:30.350 --> 06:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
lines uh still page 1 17 and 18 offers a
 
06:45:32.570 --> 06:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
when this shall not apply
 
06:45:35.390 --> 06:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
and it's basically when the owner can
 
06:45:36.948 --> 06:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
show that they made a good faith effort
 
06:45:38.448 --> 06:45:38.458 align:start position:0%
to find the unit
 
06:45:40.128 --> 06:45:40.138 align:start position:0%
um at the hearing
 
06:45:43.368 --> 06:45:43.378 align:start position:0%
or that the evictions are uh Justified
 
06:45:46.368 --> 06:45:46.378 align:start position:0%
under the sections a through
 
06:45:51.890 --> 06:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
um G and again the language about shall
 
06:45:53.510 --> 06:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
not apply was again borrowed from the
 
06:45:56.330 --> 06:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:56.340 --> 06:45:57.048 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:45:57.048 --> 06:45:57.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:00.530 --> 06:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
so starting on line 19 evictions based
 
06:46:02.930 --> 06:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
on intent to remove dwellings from the
 
06:46:07.730 --> 06:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
market uh 21 for 26 offers the elements
 
06:46:10.610 --> 06:46:10.620 align:start position:0%
um one that the eviction notice shall
 
06:46:13.730 --> 06:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
provide 10 at 60 days at least and be a
 
06:46:16.190 --> 06:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
sworn affidavit that will not be on the
 
06:46:17.628 --> 06:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
market for
 
06:46:19.968 --> 06:46:19.978 align:start position:0%
um a year and then it gets into the
 
06:46:25.010 --> 06:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:28.490 --> 06:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
um so the amount of the penalty the
 
06:46:29.930 --> 06:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
justification behind that it's a low
 
06:46:31.368 --> 06:46:31.378 align:start position:0%
ball for what
 
06:46:31.378 --> 06:46:32.030 align:start position:0%
ball for what
um

06:46:32.030 --> 06:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:35.448 --> 06:46:35.458 align:start position:0%
a landlord May accrue in a year uh for
 
06:46:35.458 --> 06:46:36.890 align:start position:0%
a landlord May accrue in a year uh for
rent

06:46:36.890 --> 06:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
rent
 
06:46:38.750 --> 06:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
um so that was kind of the mindset there
 
06:46:38.760 --> 06:46:40.910 align:start position:0%
um so that was kind of the mindset there
but

06:46:40.910 --> 06:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:46:43.548 --> 06:46:43.558 align:start position:0%
uh we need some sort of accountability
 
06:46:46.670 --> 06:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh for the potential of Bad actors who
 
06:46:49.250 --> 06:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
may try to find a loophole
 
06:46:49.260 --> 06:46:50.930 align:start position:0%
may try to find a loophole
um

06:46:50.930 --> 06:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:53.930 --> 06:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
in that regard uh briefly page two line
 
06:46:56.208 --> 06:46:56.218 align:start position:0%
three through six regards
 
06:47:00.048 --> 06:47:00.058 align:start position:0%
uh Court uh having the authority to
 
06:47:02.390 --> 06:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
Grant uh discretionary stays up to
 
06:47:04.850 --> 06:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
excuse me up to uh six months the
 
06:47:07.968 --> 06:47:07.978 align:start position:0%
current lie I believe is 90 days but if
 
06:47:11.150 --> 06:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
granted a question that you may have the
 
06:47:12.948 --> 06:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
rent will still be paid
 
06:47:12.958 --> 06:47:13.548 align:start position:0%
rent will still be paid
um

06:47:13.548 --> 06:47:13.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:15.948 --> 06:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
during this day the only consequence
 
06:47:18.530 --> 06:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
would be the potential delay
 
06:47:20.690 --> 06:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
um and again I believe six months is
 
06:47:23.448 --> 06:47:23.458 align:start position:0%
reasonable so I'm a renter
 
06:47:25.490 --> 06:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
um you know I looking at current law
 
06:47:27.890 --> 06:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
with 30 days putting myself in that
 
06:47:29.930 --> 06:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
situation I I don't quite know what I
 
06:47:31.070 --> 06:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
would do
 
06:47:33.230 --> 06:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
um you know I moved two hours away from
 
06:47:36.830 --> 06:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
my family uh unless my fellow reps from
 
06:47:39.530 --> 06:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
Durham uh rep Smith or Horgan wanted a
 
06:47:41.090 --> 06:47:41.100 align:start position:0%
roommate I don't know what I would do so
 
06:47:43.190 --> 06:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
I'd have to figure that out
 
06:47:43.200 --> 06:47:43.788 align:start position:0%
I'd have to figure that out
um

06:47:43.788 --> 06:47:43.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:43.798 --> 06:47:45.230 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:47:45.230 --> 06:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:47:47.330 --> 06:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
that's basically
 
06:47:51.468 --> 06:47:51.478 align:start position:0%
all I have I am happy to take questions
 
06:47:54.530 --> 06:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
um and I will just note that New
 
06:47:56.208 --> 06:47:56.218 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance will also be
 
06:47:57.948 --> 06:47:57.958 align:start position:0%
testifying and they may be better at
 
06:47:59.270 --> 06:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
answering some questions but I'll always
 
06:48:01.310 --> 06:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
give my best effort all right questions
 
06:48:03.708 --> 06:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
for this witness yes representative
 
06:48:03.718 --> 06:48:04.850 align:start position:0%
for this witness yes representative
Smith

06:48:04.850 --> 06:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
06:48:07.850 --> 06:48:07.860 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative me if you
 
06:48:11.410 --> 06:48:11.420 align:start position:0%
need a place to rest your head you know
 
06:48:15.650 --> 06:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
but on a more relevant question
 
06:48:15.660 --> 06:48:16.250 align:start position:0%
but on a more relevant question
um

06:48:16.250 --> 06:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:18.530 --> 06:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
so why do we need this bill you've
 
06:48:20.448 --> 06:48:20.458 align:start position:0%
explained very carefully what the bill
 
06:48:23.690 --> 06:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
does and now I want you to tell me why
 
06:48:26.208 --> 06:48:26.218 align:start position:0%
well because I I believe that
 
06:48:28.310 --> 06:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know if if there's going to be a
 
06:48:31.070 --> 06:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
renovation a tenant
 
06:48:32.990 --> 06:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
in my opinion housing is a human right
 
06:48:35.090 --> 06:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
and there needs to be adequate notice no
 
06:48:36.770 --> 06:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
matter what if someone is going to be
 
06:48:38.570 --> 06:48:38.580 align:start position:0%
deprived of
 
06:48:38.580 --> 06:48:39.530 align:start position:0%
deprived of
um

06:48:39.530 --> 06:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:41.690 --> 06:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
of their housing and there are
 
06:48:43.910 --> 06:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
situations where 30 days just isn't
 
06:48:45.890 --> 06:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
enough time after you find out about
 
06:48:45.900 --> 06:48:48.070 align:start position:0%
enough time after you find out about
renovations

06:48:48.070 --> 06:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
renovations
 
06:48:52.128 --> 06:48:52.138 align:start position:0%
to secure housing so I think it's
 
06:48:52.138 --> 06:48:53.330 align:start position:0%
to secure housing so I think it's
necessary

06:48:53.330 --> 06:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
06:48:53.340 --> 06:48:53.930 align:start position:0%
necessary
um

06:48:53.930 --> 06:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:56.570 --> 06:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
you know I will say that it's it's a a
 
06:48:58.850 --> 06:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
newer issue after talking to some people
 
06:49:01.310 --> 06:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire legal assistance uh
 
06:49:05.690 --> 06:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:08.030 --> 06:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
yes of course
 
06:49:10.430 --> 06:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
um do you have reason to believe that
 
06:49:14.090 --> 06:49:14.100 align:start position:0%
there exists at all circumstances in
 
06:49:14.100 --> 06:49:14.990 align:start position:0%
there exists at all circumstances in
which

06:49:14.990 --> 06:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
06:49:15.000 --> 06:49:16.430 align:start position:0%
which
um

06:49:16.430 --> 06:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:19.368 --> 06:49:19.378 align:start position:0%
um an owner indicates his intention his
 
06:49:23.270 --> 06:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
or her intention to renovate
 
06:49:23.280 --> 06:49:24.110 align:start position:0%
or her intention to renovate
um

06:49:24.110 --> 06:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:27.230 --> 06:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
a unit
 
06:49:30.708 --> 06:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
really with not a strong commitment to
 
06:49:34.368 --> 06:49:34.378 align:start position:0%
renovate but a desire to
 
06:49:37.430 --> 06:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
empty the apartments so that the rent
 
06:49:39.650 --> 06:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
could change
 
06:49:41.570 --> 06:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
um good question I
 
06:49:43.368 --> 06:49:43.378 align:start position:0%
I believe right now it's it's in the
 
06:49:45.048 --> 06:49:45.058 align:start position:0%
realm of possibilities and I'm sure
 
06:49:47.510 --> 06:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
people have experienced uh that based on
 
06:49:49.670 --> 06:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
conversations that I've had
 
06:49:50.930 --> 06:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:49:52.310 --> 06:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
all right other question yes
 
06:49:54.410 --> 06:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
representative tur yeah hopefully quick
 
06:49:54.420 --> 06:49:55.490 align:start position:0%
representative tur yeah hopefully quick
question

06:49:55.490 --> 06:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:49:57.770 --> 06:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
um this again sort of like one of the
 
06:50:00.590 --> 06:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
bills we heard earlier talks about uh
 
06:50:03.288 --> 06:50:03.298 align:start position:0%
eviction versus
 
06:50:06.650 --> 06:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
um the the notification prior to what
 
06:50:10.910 --> 06:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing is the end of Elise so
 
06:50:13.788 --> 06:50:13.798 align:start position:0%
does this does this apply only in the
 
06:50:15.830 --> 06:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
case where the tenant refuses to leave
 
06:50:19.730 --> 06:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
even though the owner wishes to or or if
 
06:50:21.530 --> 06:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
they give 60 days notice before the end
 
06:50:23.208 --> 06:50:23.218 align:start position:0%
of the lease is up can they simply say
 
06:50:25.128 --> 06:50:25.138 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not going to renew it's
 
06:50:27.170 --> 06:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
sort of uh add on to what we talked
 
06:50:28.610 --> 06:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
about earlier
 
06:50:30.830 --> 06:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
um in that in that regard of of whether
 
06:50:32.750 --> 06:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
or not the end of your lease means
 
06:50:34.548 --> 06:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
eviction or not
 
06:50:36.770 --> 06:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
I think I understand your question
 
06:50:39.170 --> 06:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
um I'll give it a shot what I can say is
 
06:50:41.448 --> 06:50:41.458 align:start position:0%
that current law regarding around an
 
06:50:43.490 --> 06:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
owner's intent to renovate
 
06:50:47.330 --> 06:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
requires 30 days and
 
06:50:49.070 --> 06:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
that just isn't enough time in my
 
06:50:52.128 --> 06:50:52.138 align:start position:0%
opinion so in situations
 
06:50:55.490 --> 06:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
um this is just trying to up the time
 
06:50:57.530 --> 06:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
other questions did I representative
 
06:50:59.868 --> 06:50:59.878 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair and thank
 
06:51:02.390 --> 06:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
you my friend for taking my question
 
06:51:04.310 --> 06:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
um I mean there's quite a bit of
 
06:51:06.110 --> 06:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
concerns I have with this bill but my
 
06:51:07.788 --> 06:51:07.798 align:start position:0%
biggest my biggest concern question is
 
06:51:10.850 --> 06:51:10.860 align:start position:0%
line 15 on page one tenants been offered
 
06:51:12.770 --> 06:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
a dwelling unit with the same number of
 
06:51:14.330 --> 06:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
bedrooms as are in the unit which here
 
06:51:16.548 --> 06:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
if she is being evicted at a rent that
 
06:51:18.410 --> 06:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
just doesn't exceed tenants current rent
 
06:51:21.170 --> 06:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
so is that just for like say you have an
 
06:51:23.270 --> 06:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
apartment complex like a a large
 
06:51:25.430 --> 06:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
apartment complex and they offer a
 
06:51:27.770 --> 06:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
similar one to that or is this saying
 
06:51:29.570 --> 06:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
that now the landlord has to go shop
 
06:51:33.288 --> 06:51:33.298 align:start position:0%
around and find a suitable replacement
 
06:51:34.968 --> 06:51:34.978 align:start position:0%
um when they're being evicted when their
 
06:51:36.410 --> 06:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
tenants being evicted so now the land
 
06:51:37.850 --> 06:51:37.860 align:start position:0%
it's the landlord's problem to like find
 
06:51:40.010 --> 06:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
them another place to stay
 
06:51:40.020 --> 06:51:40.670 align:start position:0%
them another place to stay
um

06:51:40.670 --> 06:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:43.128 --> 06:51:43.138 align:start position:0%
well what I'll say is I think your first
 
06:51:45.948 --> 06:51:45.958 align:start position:0%
example would qualify
 
06:51:48.530 --> 06:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
regarding your second question the
 
06:51:50.330 --> 06:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
tenant wouldn't have done anything wrong
 
06:51:54.350 --> 06:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
and 30-day notice isn't enough time so
 
06:51:56.868 --> 06:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
um is it the landlord's responsibility
 
06:52:00.288 --> 06:52:00.298 align:start position:0%
per se to shop around as you worded it
 
06:52:02.030 --> 06:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
um I think it's it's the landlord's
 
06:52:04.190 --> 06:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility to ensure that a tenant
 
06:52:07.490 --> 06:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh has adequate housing if they plan to
 
06:52:07.500 --> 06:52:09.048 align:start position:0%
uh has adequate housing if they plan to
renovate

06:52:09.048 --> 06:52:09.058 align:start position:0%
renovate
 
06:52:10.368 --> 06:52:10.378 align:start position:0%
other questions to this witness
 
06:52:12.530 --> 06:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you for
 
06:52:13.968 --> 06:52:13.978 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:52:18.230 --> 06:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
um line 2526 does that limit the owner's
 
06:52:21.230 --> 06:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
ability to sell what if I want to
 
06:52:23.330 --> 06:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
renovate and then turn around and sell
 
06:52:25.190 --> 06:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
do I have to say to the person well I'm
 
06:52:26.510 --> 06:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
going to sell it to you but you can't
 
06:52:30.350 --> 06:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
you can't rent it out for a year I just
 
06:52:32.030 --> 06:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
wondered if we're limiting the ability
 
06:52:34.430 --> 06:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
to sell in this
 
06:52:36.110 --> 06:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
um you are correct that that's the
 
06:52:38.208 --> 06:52:38.218 align:start position:0%
language so if
 
06:52:40.788 --> 06:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
your take if the it's going to be
 
06:52:42.410 --> 06:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
brought off the market
 
06:52:45.410 --> 06:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
um then even if it is sold because there
 
06:52:48.110 --> 06:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
has to be some form of accountability
 
06:52:50.868 --> 06:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
um you know in situations where
 
06:52:52.548 --> 06:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
per se
 
06:52:54.830 --> 06:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
there are workarounds without that sort
 
06:52:56.150 --> 06:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
of accountability
 
06:52:59.150 --> 06:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
um you know sell it to a landlord who
 
06:53:01.490 --> 06:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
you know you may be allies with or
 
06:53:01.500 --> 06:53:05.330 align:start position:0%
you know you may be allies with or
whatnot

06:53:05.330 --> 06:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:08.510 --> 06:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
06:53:11.448 --> 06:53:11.458 align:start position:0%
oh representative Manos thank you Mr
 
06:53:14.270 --> 06:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative Kenny um
 
06:53:16.788 --> 06:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
I wanted to ask I wasn't clear on your
 
06:53:19.010 --> 06:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
explanation about the relationship
 
06:53:21.110 --> 06:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
between the six-month stay and the
 
06:53:23.690 --> 06:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
obligation to continue to pay rent could
 
06:53:25.910 --> 06:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
you clarify that please
 
06:53:27.948 --> 06:53:27.958 align:start position:0%
could you say that one more time
 
06:53:30.708 --> 06:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
I believe you said earlier that there
 
06:53:33.890 --> 06:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
was that during a stay there was an
 
06:53:35.868 --> 06:53:35.878 align:start position:0%
obligation to continue to pay rent
 
06:53:37.910 --> 06:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's what I understood maybe I
 
06:53:39.708 --> 06:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
misunderstood you but I was wondering if
 
06:53:42.530 --> 06:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
you could just clarify talking about the
 
06:53:44.570 --> 06:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
discretionary stay yes
 
06:53:47.150 --> 06:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
um so to my understanding that if the
 
06:53:49.250 --> 06:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
court was to order a discretionary stay
 
06:53:51.110 --> 06:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
that the landlord would still be
 
06:53:53.810 --> 06:53:53.820 align:start position:0%
receiving uh rent through that state the
 
06:53:56.628 --> 06:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
only consequence would be pushing off
 
06:53:59.628 --> 06:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:01.968 --> 06:54:01.978 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
06:54:03.590 --> 06:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much sir
 
06:54:05.570 --> 06:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:54:18.590 --> 06:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:20.510 --> 06:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Jessica
 
06:54:23.690 --> 06:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
marjason still Granite State organizing
 
06:54:25.670 --> 06:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
project and
 
06:54:28.010 --> 06:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
um I am wanting to let you guys know I
 
06:54:29.570 --> 06:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
do fully uh
 
06:54:31.850 --> 06:54:31.860 align:start position:0%
I love Bill 401
 
06:54:33.650 --> 06:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
um this is something I've looked forward
 
06:54:35.990 --> 06:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
to being created over the past couple
 
06:54:38.750 --> 06:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
years and watching what I've seen as I
 
06:54:41.390 --> 06:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
explained my tenant Clinic started as an
 
06:54:42.948 --> 06:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
eviction Clinic because of the mass
 
06:54:45.770 --> 06:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
amounts of renovation evictions that we
 
06:54:49.070 --> 06:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
were seeing after about six months we
 
06:54:50.868 --> 06:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
were able to transition it into a tenant
 
06:54:52.730 --> 06:54:52.740 align:start position:0%
Clinic to meet any tenants it needs but
 
06:54:54.708 --> 06:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
the evictions the renovation evictions
 
06:54:57.468 --> 06:54:57.478 align:start position:0%
were so high tenants would commonly say
 
06:54:59.208 --> 06:54:59.218 align:start position:0%
the house to my left and the house to my
 
06:55:01.430 --> 06:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
right is up for sale everywhere I look
 
06:55:03.468 --> 06:55:03.478 align:start position:0%
is up for sale
 
06:55:03.478 --> 06:55:04.788 align:start position:0%
is up for sale
um

06:55:04.788 --> 06:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:55:08.868 --> 06:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
so things I've seen this beam misused by
 
06:55:11.330 --> 06:55:11.340 align:start position:0%
360 Dubuque Street in Manchester I've
 
06:55:13.910 --> 06:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned this place before the tenants
 
06:55:15.530 --> 06:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
called me when they got the renovation
 
06:55:17.150 --> 06:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
eviction as we were going through the
 
06:55:19.368 --> 06:55:19.378 align:start position:0%
process they decided to go ahead and
 
06:55:20.830 --> 06:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
move out in time
 
06:55:23.448 --> 06:55:23.458 align:start position:0%
their landlord was intimidating them a
 
06:55:25.968 --> 06:55:25.978 align:start position:0%
lot so on the day that the first floor
 
06:55:27.708 --> 06:55:27.718 align:start position:0%
tenant was moving out she called me
 
06:55:29.690 --> 06:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
because she was scared to go in and get
 
06:55:31.368 --> 06:55:31.378 align:start position:0%
the last bit of her stuff because the
 
06:55:33.830 --> 06:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
new person was already moving in they
 
06:55:35.208 --> 06:55:35.218 align:start position:0%
didn't even have time to sweep the
 
06:55:37.430 --> 06:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
floors no renovation happened there but
 
06:55:38.628 --> 06:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
it was used
 
06:55:42.830 --> 06:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
last year when we had SB 217 here and we
 
06:55:44.448 --> 06:55:44.458 align:start position:0%
were all here to test a lot of us were
 
06:55:46.430 --> 06:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
here to testify on that
 
06:55:48.770 --> 06:55:48.780 align:start position:0%
um we got to hear Nick Norman testify
 
06:55:52.128 --> 06:55:52.138 align:start position:0%
that commonly when they use another form
 
06:55:54.110 --> 06:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
of eviction and it doesn't go through or
 
06:55:56.390 --> 06:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work the renovation eviction
 
06:55:58.910 --> 06:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
is the one they turn to because it goes
 
06:56:01.548 --> 06:56:01.558 align:start position:0%
right through may not be the exact every
 
06:56:03.948 --> 06:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
single word used but that was the full
 
06:56:05.628 --> 06:56:05.638 align:start position:0%
implication and luckily he's here to
 
06:56:07.490 --> 06:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
explain that but it is something
 
06:56:10.730 --> 06:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
commonly as we learned that day used by
 
06:56:12.830 --> 06:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
landlords when all else fails just use
 
06:56:14.628 --> 06:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
the renovation eviction it goes right
 
06:56:14.638 --> 06:56:16.250 align:start position:0%
the renovation eviction it goes right
through

06:56:16.250 --> 06:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
through
 
06:56:16.260 --> 06:56:17.030 align:start position:0%
through
um

06:56:17.030 --> 06:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:56:19.850 --> 06:56:19.860 align:start position:0%
this also the renovation evictions are a
 
06:56:22.310 --> 06:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
no-fault addiction for the tenants we
 
06:56:25.368 --> 06:56:25.378 align:start position:0%
should be doing anything possible in
 
06:56:27.948 --> 06:56:27.958 align:start position:0%
applying any protection we can put in
 
06:56:30.048 --> 06:56:30.058 align:start position:0%
place to make sure it remains a no-fault
 
06:56:31.368 --> 06:56:31.378 align:start position:0%
eviction and they don't suffer
 
06:56:33.770 --> 06:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
consequences that happen so the six
 
06:56:37.548 --> 06:56:37.558 align:start position:0%
months is great to add into there giving
 
06:56:39.230 --> 06:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
them that time as we've all heard it
 
06:56:41.510 --> 06:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
takes about that time it gives a family
 
06:56:43.368 --> 06:56:43.378 align:start position:0%
time to plan save up the money change
 
06:56:45.288 --> 06:56:45.298 align:start position:0%
the schools do all that they never
 
06:56:47.690 --> 06:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
intended to move this is a no-fault
 
06:56:47.700 --> 06:56:49.250 align:start position:0%
intended to move this is a no-fault
addiction

06:56:49.250 --> 06:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
addiction
 
06:56:49.260 --> 06:56:49.968 align:start position:0%
addiction
um

06:56:49.968 --> 06:56:49.978 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:56:52.250 --> 06:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
so because of protections needing to be
 
06:56:55.190 --> 06:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
in place for stuff like that um
 
06:56:57.048 --> 06:56:57.058 align:start position:0%
when you're in court and you're
 
06:56:59.628 --> 06:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
listening to the landlord what will
 
06:57:01.430 --> 06:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
happen is this side will say well I
 
06:57:02.628 --> 06:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
don't think they're going to do a lot of
 
06:57:04.430 --> 06:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
Renovations the landlord or the attorney
 
06:57:07.190 --> 06:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
will say well we have this list planned
 
06:57:08.750 --> 06:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
and they'll they'll shoot off a couple
 
06:57:10.690 --> 06:57:10.700 align:start position:0%
lines but that doesn't really explain
 
06:57:13.548 --> 06:57:13.558 align:start position:0%
anything to the other side if you list
 
06:57:15.170 --> 06:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
10 things that sounds like you're going
 
06:57:17.770 --> 06:57:17.780 align:start position:0%
to be busy it's believed and put through
 
06:57:20.570 --> 06:57:20.580 align:start position:0%
so having something like that set in
 
06:57:22.670 --> 06:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
place where it encourages them to do the
 
06:57:25.850 --> 06:57:25.860 align:start position:0%
work with the tenant in there or
 
06:57:29.390 --> 06:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
um sets parameters to where
 
06:57:32.030 --> 06:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
they have to actually be doing the work
 
06:57:34.850 --> 06:57:34.860 align:start position:0%
required to have a tenant move out is
 
06:57:36.468 --> 06:57:36.478 align:start position:0%
very needed because of the rampant
 
06:57:38.810 --> 06:57:38.820 align:start position:0%
misuse of this eviction procedure thank
 
06:57:41.448 --> 06:57:41.458 align:start position:0%
you questions for this Witness
 
06:57:43.610 --> 06:57:43.620 align:start position:0%

06:57:43.620 --> 06:57:44.330 align:start position:0%

06:57:59.090 --> 06:57:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:00.948 --> 06:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
06:58:02.330 --> 06:58:02.340 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I know it's
 
06:58:04.250 --> 06:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
been a long day and I truly appreciate
 
06:58:05.930 --> 06:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
the fact that you're still here to hear
 
06:58:07.850 --> 06:58:07.860 align:start position:0%
my testimony
 
06:58:10.430 --> 06:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
um I um
 
06:58:10.440 --> 06:58:11.390 align:start position:0%
um I um
um

06:58:11.390 --> 06:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:13.368 --> 06:58:13.378 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot of bills today and
 
06:58:15.048 --> 06:58:15.058 align:start position:0%
almost all of them have been focused on
 
06:58:17.890 --> 06:58:17.900 align:start position:0%
trying to keep people in their homes
 
06:58:20.990 --> 06:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
and you know maintaining a Workforce for
 
06:58:23.150 --> 06:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
businesses and the quality of life for
 
06:58:25.610 --> 06:58:25.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents is is really
 
06:58:28.070 --> 06:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
important it's it's why we're here and
 
06:58:30.230 --> 06:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
what we have is a systemic housing
 
06:58:33.770 --> 06:58:33.780 align:start position:0%
problem and the problem keeps shifting I
 
06:58:36.410 --> 06:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
signed on to this bill because I am very
 
06:58:38.628 --> 06:58:38.638 align:start position:0%
concerned about the issues of renovation
 
06:58:40.968 --> 06:58:40.978 align:start position:0%
which Ms margison just told you about
 
06:58:44.150 --> 06:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to focus I was not
 
06:58:46.190 --> 06:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
um I am not a law student and I wasn't
 
06:58:48.770 --> 06:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
really involved in writing this bill but
 
06:58:51.110 --> 06:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to focus on the problem
 
06:58:54.110 --> 06:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
that this legislation will help to solve
 
06:58:56.510 --> 06:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
the issue is that there are renters who
 
06:58:59.090 --> 06:58:59.100 align:start position:0%
have never missed a payment they can be
 
06:59:01.730 --> 06:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
invicted by the owner if they plan to
 
06:59:03.468 --> 06:59:03.478 align:start position:0%
renovate a unit
 
06:59:05.390 --> 06:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
um this bill would give people a 60-day
 
06:59:07.368 --> 06:59:07.378 align:start position:0%
notice that is nowhere near enough time
 
06:59:09.830 --> 06:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
for the people who are being displaced
 
06:59:12.048 --> 06:59:12.058 align:start position:0%
to find another place to live so you're
 
06:59:15.170 --> 06:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
creating a homelessness issue there
 
06:59:17.690 --> 06:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
um and there are it is a significant
 
06:59:19.968 --> 06:59:19.978 align:start position:0%
number of people who are being displaced
 
06:59:23.448 --> 06:59:23.458 align:start position:0%
by these renovation evictions this bill
 
06:59:25.788 --> 06:59:25.798 align:start position:0%
would help Define the parameters of a
 
06:59:28.070 --> 06:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
renovation project that would warrant an
 
06:59:30.770 --> 06:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
eviction as Ms margeson just told you
 
06:59:32.628 --> 06:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes they just sweet they didn't
 
06:59:34.190 --> 06:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
even have time to sweep the floors
 
06:59:36.048 --> 06:59:36.058 align:start position:0%
before they put somebody in there after
 
06:59:39.288 --> 06:59:39.298 align:start position:0%
they evicted somebody claiming that they
 
06:59:41.810 --> 06:59:41.820 align:start position:0%
were going to renovate the property
 
06:59:44.810 --> 06:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
um obviously we want a landlords to
 
06:59:47.208 --> 06:59:47.218 align:start position:0%
maintain their properties but there
 
06:59:50.448 --> 06:59:50.458 align:start position:0%
needs to be a balance and um you know I
 
06:59:52.490 --> 06:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
I do know very some very good landlords
 
06:59:55.430 --> 06:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
the good landlords will wait till uh uh
 
06:59:57.410 --> 06:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
a unit is empty and then they will go in
 
06:59:59.448 --> 06:59:59.458 align:start position:0%
and then they will do the necessary
 
07:00:01.490 --> 07:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
Renovations and then they'll turn it and
 
07:00:03.650 --> 07:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
around and rent it out again and that's
 
07:00:06.890 --> 07:00:06.900 align:start position:0%
I really truly admire that
 
07:00:08.868 --> 07:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
um but generally what has been happening
 
07:00:11.150 --> 07:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
is that people have been in their home
 
07:00:12.830 --> 07:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
for a number of years and the property
 
07:00:15.530 --> 07:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
is sold the new owner wants to upgrade
 
07:00:17.930 --> 07:00:17.940 align:start position:0%
the unit or just significantly increase
 
07:00:20.990 --> 07:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
the rent and longtime tenants who've
 
07:00:24.410 --> 07:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
lived in a unit for 20 or 30 years often
 
07:00:27.590 --> 07:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
older people on fixed incomes they've
 
07:00:29.570 --> 07:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
never missed the rent payment they find
 
07:00:32.150 --> 07:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
themselves being evicted and there is no
 
07:00:34.788 --> 07:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
place for them to go
 
07:00:36.350 --> 07:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
um this happens in individual rental
 
07:00:39.590 --> 07:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
properties and in large complexes one
 
07:00:41.510 --> 07:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
thing that we obviously
 
07:00:43.910 --> 07:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
um that will we need to watch out for is
 
07:00:43.920 --> 07:00:45.048 align:start position:0%
um that will we need to watch out for is
that

07:00:45.048 --> 07:00:45.058 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:00:46.968 --> 07:00:46.978 align:start position:0%
um if you're old like me you remember
 
07:00:48.530 --> 07:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
when there were incentives to build
 
07:00:52.070 --> 07:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing and so developers were
 
07:00:54.230 --> 07:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
given incentives to build these
 
07:00:56.448 --> 07:00:56.458 align:start position:0%
properties with the agreement that they
 
07:00:58.490 --> 07:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
would keep them affordable for a certain
 
07:01:01.310 --> 07:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
length of time and what happens is that
 
07:01:04.670 --> 07:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
that expires and then the property is
 
07:01:06.708 --> 07:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
sold to a new owner and they're not
 
07:01:09.948 --> 07:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
they're not obligated to maintain any of
 
07:01:13.190 --> 07:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
that affordability or you know to take
 
07:01:16.628 --> 07:01:16.638 align:start position:0%
Section 8 vouchers as the previous owner
 
07:01:20.390 --> 07:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
was was doing this happened in a large
 
07:01:22.610 --> 07:01:22.620 align:start position:0%
development in Manchester I know that
 
07:01:24.410 --> 07:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
there was a development in Concord where
 
07:01:26.208 --> 07:01:26.218 align:start position:0%
this happened and there was one up in
 
07:01:28.850 --> 07:01:28.860 align:start position:0%
Lebanon where the
 
07:01:31.490 --> 07:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
um where they were able to the local
 
07:01:33.830 --> 07:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
Housing Authority was able to buy the
 
07:01:35.628 --> 07:01:35.638 align:start position:0%
the building and keep people in these
 
07:01:38.510 --> 07:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
affordable units but um you know there
 
07:01:41.030 --> 07:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
there's the potential of thousands of
 
07:01:43.030 --> 07:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
people who could get
 
07:01:45.350 --> 07:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
evicted from their
 
07:01:47.570 --> 07:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
um their affordable properties these
 
07:01:49.968 --> 07:01:49.978 align:start position:0%
low-income developments Workforce
 
07:01:52.730 --> 07:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
housing and put out on the street with
 
07:01:54.890 --> 07:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
no place for them to go and I think that
 
07:01:57.650 --> 07:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
that's the critical thing about this is
 
07:01:59.868 --> 07:01:59.878 align:start position:0%
that there is no place for people to go
 
07:02:03.468 --> 07:02:03.478 align:start position:0%
when they get evicted you know as policy
 
07:02:03.478 --> 07:02:04.910 align:start position:0%
when they get evicted you know as policy
makers

07:02:04.910 --> 07:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
makers
 
07:02:07.368 --> 07:02:07.378 align:start position:0%
I think we can use our the power of
 
07:02:10.250 --> 07:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
legislation to help mitigate the impacts
 
07:02:12.890 --> 07:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
of these things on our constituents and
 
07:02:16.250 --> 07:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
I think that you know looking at
 
07:02:18.590 --> 07:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
looking at this situation and it's it's
 
07:02:20.448 --> 07:02:20.458 align:start position:0%
a systemic problem that we have in the
 
07:02:21.948 --> 07:02:21.958 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and I really
 
07:02:23.690 --> 07:02:23.700 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that you have spent
 
07:02:25.968 --> 07:02:25.978 align:start position:0%
the whole day listening to the various
 
07:02:28.368 --> 07:02:28.378 align:start position:0%
aspects of this problem and how it is
 
07:02:28.378 --> 07:02:29.628 align:start position:0%
aspects of this problem and how it is
impacting

07:02:29.628 --> 07:02:29.638 align:start position:0%
impacting
 
07:02:31.430 --> 07:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
um our constituents
 
07:02:34.850 --> 07:02:34.860 align:start position:0%
um and I hope that um you will look at
 
07:02:36.830 --> 07:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
ways to help keep people in their homes
 
07:02:40.128 --> 07:02:40.138 align:start position:0%
and um and I appreciate your listening

Association of Realtors
 
07:03:19.910 --> 07:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're opposed to House Bill 401 although
 
07:03:21.948 --> 07:03:21.958 align:start position:0%
we do understand the reason for which it
 
07:03:24.230 --> 07:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
was crafted and that the sponsors put
 
07:03:25.930 --> 07:03:25.940 align:start position:0%
this forward and we sympathize with them
 
07:03:28.368 --> 07:03:28.378 align:start position:0%
it appears that this legislation was
 
07:03:29.810 --> 07:03:29.820 align:start position:0%
crafted to deal with the current and
 
07:03:31.250 --> 07:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
very real housing shortage that we're
 
07:03:33.770 --> 07:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
facing across the state vacancy rates in
 
07:03:36.230 --> 07:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
most communities are currently around or
 
07:03:39.048 --> 07:03:39.058 align:start position:0%
a one percent or less at this time so
 
07:03:40.430 --> 07:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
finding an apartment is an enormous
 
07:03:41.750 --> 07:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
challenge which causes significant
 
07:03:43.730 --> 07:03:43.740 align:start position:0%
strain on families worklers and the
 
07:03:45.110 --> 07:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
overall economy
 
07:03:47.090 --> 07:03:47.100 align:start position:0%
as you consider the bill I want to make
 
07:03:49.190 --> 07:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
a few things clear first any tenant with
 
07:03:50.930 --> 07:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
a signed lease whatever the term may be
 
07:03:52.850 --> 07:03:52.860 align:start position:0%
cannot be evicted during that time frame
 
07:03:54.770 --> 07:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
stipulated and Lease even if it's for a
 
07:03:57.530 --> 07:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
repair or renovation or if the landlord
 
07:03:59.628 --> 07:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
wants to take the unit off the market so
 
07:04:01.310 --> 07:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
if you have a contract both the landlord
 
07:04:02.930 --> 07:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
and tenant must adhere to those terms
 
07:04:05.270 --> 07:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
and those terms are willingly agreed to
 
07:04:06.948 --> 07:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
by the two parties evidenced by signing
 
07:04:09.350 --> 07:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
a lease the tenant is clearly aware of
 
07:04:10.548 --> 07:04:10.558 align:start position:0%
the length of that lease and no
 
07:04:12.070 --> 07:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
guarantees are made beyond that date
 
07:04:14.030 --> 07:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
second if a tenant is on a
 
07:04:15.590 --> 07:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
month-to-month basis that means either
 
07:04:17.570 --> 07:04:17.580 align:start position:0%
the tenant or the landlord may give the
 
07:04:19.368 --> 07:04:19.378 align:start position:0%
other 30 days notice to end the lease
 
07:04:21.590 --> 07:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
many tenants find the ability to leave
 
07:04:23.690 --> 07:04:23.700 align:start position:0%
their tenancy quickly without a penalty
 
07:04:26.510 --> 07:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
to be desirable House Bill 401 extends
 
07:04:28.430 --> 07:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
the notice period to 60 days I believe
 
07:04:30.110 --> 07:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
that 60 days would be the longest notice
 
07:04:32.510 --> 07:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
imposed by any New England State
 
07:04:34.490 --> 07:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
at the very least the same time frame
 
07:04:36.048 --> 07:04:36.058 align:start position:0%
should be mandated on the tenant to
 
07:04:37.788 --> 07:04:37.798 align:start position:0%
notify the landlord prior to leaving in
 
07:04:39.708 --> 07:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
a month-to-month Arrangement effectively
 
07:04:41.330 --> 07:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
changing it to a buy month to buy a
 
07:04:43.368 --> 07:04:43.378 align:start position:0%
month tenancy and misaligning it with
 
07:04:44.750 --> 07:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
other statutes already in place which
 
07:04:46.610 --> 07:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
already have a 30-day standard in our
 
07:04:48.468 --> 07:04:48.478 align:start position:0%
current law
 
07:04:50.270 --> 07:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
keep in mind currently a landlord must
 
07:04:52.190 --> 07:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
provide a 30-day notice to evict the
 
07:04:53.628 --> 07:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
court hearing is another 30 days
 
07:04:55.788 --> 07:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
typically so we effectively have 60 days
 
07:04:58.128 --> 07:04:58.138 align:start position:0%
of procedure already in place judges are
 
07:04:59.868 --> 07:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
then permitted and routinely do allow
 
07:05:01.910 --> 07:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
tenants to stay an additional 30 to 90
 
07:05:01.920 --> 07:05:02.930 align:start position:0%
tenants to stay an additional 30 to 90
days

07:05:02.930 --> 07:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
days
 
07:05:04.670 --> 07:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
So currently tenants often receive
 
07:05:06.590 --> 07:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 90 to 150 days from
 
07:05:08.868 --> 07:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
initial notice until they need to vacate
 
07:05:10.490 --> 07:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
an argument that there are no existing
 
07:05:12.468 --> 07:05:12.478 align:start position:0%
statutory protections for tenants is not
 
07:05:14.570 --> 07:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
accurate evictions are not inexpensive
 
07:05:17.090 --> 07:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
for a landlord I'm not a lawyer but the
 
07:05:18.468 --> 07:05:18.478 align:start position:0%
legislation appears to place further
 
07:05:20.150 --> 07:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
burden on the landlord to demonstrate to
 
07:05:21.650 --> 07:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
a court that the repairs are necessary
 
07:05:23.868 --> 07:05:23.878 align:start position:0%
most tenants fail to pay the rent owed
 
07:05:25.968 --> 07:05:25.978 align:start position:0%
to a landlord once evicted and I was
 
07:05:29.150 --> 07:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
just quoted 1500 for an easy eviction by
 
07:05:31.670 --> 07:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
an attorney merely for the legal fees
 
07:05:33.890 --> 07:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
add to that the utility costs the unpaid
 
07:05:36.650 --> 07:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
rents and damages often left behind and
 
07:05:37.968 --> 07:05:37.978 align:start position:0%
my average eviction has cost me
 
07:05:39.468 --> 07:05:39.478 align:start position:0%
personally over six thousand dollars in
 
07:05:42.350 --> 07:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
my units only only a few owning only a
 
07:05:43.548 --> 07:05:43.558 align:start position:0%
few units that means that my rental
 
07:05:45.708 --> 07:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
profits for the entire year are eaten up
 
07:05:48.048 --> 07:05:48.058 align:start position:0%
by just one eviction but I still have to
 
07:05:50.030 --> 07:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
pay the bank interest on the mortgage so
 
07:05:51.708 --> 07:05:51.718 align:start position:0%
they're often the only ones profiting
 
07:05:53.810 --> 07:05:53.820 align:start position:0%
from my real estate investment holding
 
07:05:55.730 --> 07:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
if a tenant under existing statute
 
07:05:57.890 --> 07:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
wishes to contest the repair they
 
07:05:59.390 --> 07:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
certainly have that ability and a judge
 
07:06:00.530 --> 07:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
could then seek additional information
 
07:06:02.810 --> 07:06:02.820 align:start position:0%
from the landlord if warranted under
 
07:06:04.670 --> 07:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
this bill I would be required to submit
 
07:06:06.650 --> 07:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
specific evidence to the nature cost and
 
07:06:08.750 --> 07:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
time frame even if there's no dispute as
 
07:06:11.868 --> 07:06:11.878 align:start position:0%
to the rationale that repairs are needed
 
07:06:14.750 --> 07:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
in the new language on 542 B it states I
 
07:06:16.368 --> 07:06:16.378 align:start position:0%
will need to provide a sworn affidavit
 
07:06:17.868 --> 07:06:17.878 align:start position:0%
from the owner stating that the dwelling
 
07:06:19.368 --> 07:06:19.378 align:start position:0%
unit will remain off the market for not
 
07:06:21.468 --> 07:06:21.478 align:start position:0%
less than one year but if I sell the
 
07:06:23.330 --> 07:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
property with one within one year and
 
07:06:24.770 --> 07:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
the new owner makes it available for
 
07:06:26.868 --> 07:06:26.878 align:start position:0%
residential purposes this seems to
 
07:06:28.190 --> 07:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
indicate that I would still be liable
 
07:06:29.570 --> 07:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
even though I don't own the property
 
07:06:31.788 --> 07:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
currently additionally I don't see where
 
07:06:33.468 --> 07:06:33.478 align:start position:0%
there's a statutory definition of remove
 
07:06:35.208 --> 07:06:35.218 align:start position:0%
the dwelling unit from the residential
 
07:06:37.690 --> 07:06:37.700 align:start position:0%
rental market in state statute
 
07:06:42.048 --> 07:06:42.058 align:start position:0%
you're kind of going over your uh time
 
07:06:44.810 --> 07:06:44.820 align:start position:0%
uh so can I just ask you to sort of sum
 
07:06:46.610 --> 07:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
up sure
 
07:06:48.650 --> 07:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
um so large layer scale landlords will
 
07:06:49.850 --> 07:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
probably have fewer issues with this
 
07:06:52.730 --> 07:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
bill than small landlords such as myself
 
07:06:54.230 --> 07:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
um we need more apartments in the state
 
07:06:55.490 --> 07:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
and additional new governmental
 
07:06:57.110 --> 07:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
regulations may cause some deceased
 
07:06:58.610 --> 07:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
renting and we feel that that would hurt
 
07:07:00.530 --> 07:07:00.540 align:start position:0%
everyone and we feel that the real issue
 
07:07:02.590 --> 07:07:02.600 align:start position:0%
here is that there's a lack of housing
 
07:07:05.150 --> 07:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
not a lack of protection for tenants
 
07:07:07.850 --> 07:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
from being evicted for necessary repairs
 
07:07:10.010 --> 07:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh questions for
 
07:07:11.090 --> 07:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
this witness what representative
 
07:07:13.128 --> 07:07:13.138 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you so um if I heard you
 
07:07:14.570 --> 07:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
correctly would you say the housing
 
07:07:16.430 --> 07:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
crisis is more of a supply side issue
 
07:07:18.048 --> 07:07:18.058 align:start position:0%
and not a regulation issue yes
 
07:07:18.058 --> 07:07:19.310 align:start position:0%
and not a regulation issue yes
absolutely

07:07:19.310 --> 07:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
07:07:20.930 --> 07:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness
 
07:07:23.628 --> 07:07:23.638 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon
 
07:07:25.430 --> 07:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
hope it's okay to ask you a question I
 
07:07:27.048 --> 07:07:27.058 align:start position:0%
am a co-sponsor of the bill but
 
07:07:29.690 --> 07:07:29.700 align:start position:0%
something I'm wondering about let's say
 
07:07:32.150 --> 07:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
let's say I do buy an empty uh
 
07:07:35.390 --> 07:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
multi-family rental property uh you know
 
07:07:37.128 --> 07:07:37.138 align:start position:0%
wishing to increase the supply of
 
07:07:38.868 --> 07:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
Housing and possibly profit hopefully
 
07:07:40.430 --> 07:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
more than six thousand dollars a year
 
07:07:43.310 --> 07:07:43.320 align:start position:0%
for the whole building but um how do I
 
07:07:46.730 --> 07:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
so how how do I how do I protect myself
 
07:07:46.740 --> 07:07:48.730 align:start position:0%
so how how do I how do I protect myself
from

07:07:48.730 --> 07:07:48.740 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:07:51.410 --> 07:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
what steps can I take to make sure that
 
07:07:53.868 --> 07:07:53.878 align:start position:0%
this uh building wasn't taken off the
 
07:07:56.448 --> 07:07:56.458 align:start position:0%
market in order to to pick the uh
 
07:07:59.150 --> 07:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
tenants within that time frame with the
 
07:08:01.730 --> 07:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
short of what I have to go down to the
 
07:08:02.990 --> 07:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
courthouse and look through all the
 
07:08:04.310 --> 07:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
evictions to see if people have been
 
07:08:06.350 --> 07:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
evicted that address or is there some
 
07:08:09.350 --> 07:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
easier way to to find out like is this
 
07:08:11.570 --> 07:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
something that I could reasonably expect
 
07:08:14.448 --> 07:08:14.458 align:start position:0%
the seller to inform me of along with
 
07:08:16.548 --> 07:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
as I assumed there's always I'd have to
 
07:08:18.230 --> 07:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
ask about any other gasolines or
 
07:08:19.788 --> 07:08:19.798 align:start position:0%
obligations on the building so is that
 
07:08:20.930 --> 07:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
something I
 
07:08:23.150 --> 07:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
should probably expect myself to ask him
 
07:08:25.430 --> 07:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
about him or her about it when I buy the
 
07:08:25.440 --> 07:08:26.930 align:start position:0%
about him or her about it when I buy the
property

07:08:26.930 --> 07:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
property
 
07:08:29.030 --> 07:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know that there are any
 
07:08:31.190 --> 07:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
statutory describe requirements for any
 
07:08:33.590 --> 07:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
disclosure related to this in place I
 
07:08:35.270 --> 07:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
know that there are required disclosures
 
07:08:37.670 --> 07:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
which sometimes aren't observed
 
07:08:40.310 --> 07:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
um and uh personally dealt with one of
 
07:08:42.288 --> 07:08:42.298 align:start position:0%
those in a building that had in
 
07:08:44.448 --> 07:08:44.458 align:start position:0%
um insufficient electrical service that
 
07:08:46.730 --> 07:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
when if someone someone had used the six
 
07:08:48.410 --> 07:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
month stay
 
07:08:49.730 --> 07:08:49.740 align:start position:0%
um like let's say The Last Tenant out
 
07:08:50.990 --> 07:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
the door I would have had four vacant
 
07:08:52.368 --> 07:08:52.378 align:start position:0%
units and they would have been in a
 
07:08:53.750 --> 07:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
construction zone if we move forward
 
07:08:55.310 --> 07:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
with the others and they would have had
 
07:08:57.830 --> 07:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
very unsafe electrical conditions uh
 
07:08:59.690 --> 07:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
persisting for those six months so that
 
07:09:01.968 --> 07:09:01.978 align:start position:0%
it creates other challenges and I don't
 
07:09:04.010 --> 07:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
know how to protect against that
 
07:09:06.468 --> 07:09:06.478 align:start position:0%
um because once title has transferred um
 
07:09:09.048 --> 07:09:09.058 align:start position:0%
a real estate attorney told me on that
 
07:09:11.150 --> 07:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
we had no recourse we would have had to
 
07:09:12.948 --> 07:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
found the lack of disclosure prior to
 
07:09:14.868 --> 07:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
the date of closing and once the date of
 
07:09:16.190 --> 07:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
closing had passed we had no more
 
07:09:17.690 --> 07:09:17.700 align:start position:0%
recourse remaining
 
07:09:20.030 --> 07:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
07:09:22.310 --> 07:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative Andrus
 
07:09:24.410 --> 07:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
07:09:27.468 --> 07:09:27.478 align:start position:0%
taking my question are there any figures
 
07:09:31.070 --> 07:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
available as to what type of housing is
 
07:09:32.810 --> 07:09:32.820 align:start position:0%
needed in New Hampshire is it
 
07:09:35.570 --> 07:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
departments it is the individual housing
 
07:09:38.750 --> 07:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
is it low-income housing uh I'm just
 
07:09:41.090 --> 07:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
trying to wrap my head around it all so
 
07:09:43.250 --> 07:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
actually uh there's a wealth of
 
07:09:44.628 --> 07:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
information put out largely by New
 
07:09:46.010 --> 07:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority
 
07:09:48.230 --> 07:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
they're the quasi-governmental agency
 
07:09:50.090 --> 07:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
that distributes a substantial amount of
 
07:09:51.770 --> 07:09:51.780 align:start position:0%
housing data that is backed by
 
07:09:53.810 --> 07:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
substantial resource and they receive
 
07:09:55.788 --> 07:09:55.798 align:start position:0%
the federal funds to then distribute
 
07:09:57.830 --> 07:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
through the litec program the low income
 
07:09:59.570 --> 07:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
low-income housing tax credit program
 
07:10:02.510 --> 07:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
among many others they also administer
 
07:10:04.430 --> 07:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
the federal funds for Section 8 housing
 
07:10:07.548 --> 07:10:07.558 align:start position:0%
Choice vouchers so they are a wealth of
 
07:10:08.690 --> 07:10:08.700 align:start position:0%
that information and they're very
 
07:10:10.990 --> 07:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
helpful so if you go to the
 
07:10:13.610 --> 07:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
nhhfa.org website you'll be able to find
 
07:10:15.350 --> 07:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
some excellent statistics and they break
 
07:10:17.570 --> 07:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
out the type of housing needed as well
 
07:10:19.610 --> 07:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
as some of the challenges faced largely
 
07:10:21.650 --> 07:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
by local zoning and planning ports that
 
07:10:23.510 --> 07:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
are restrict in the type of housing that
 
07:10:26.690 --> 07:10:26.700 align:start position:0%
we do need and the density that could be
 
07:10:28.010 --> 07:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
available there
 
07:10:30.708 --> 07:10:30.718 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
07:10:33.128 --> 07:10:33.138 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much sir
 
07:10:46.310 --> 07:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:49.788 --> 07:10:49.798 align:start position:0%
all right my name is Brandon Lemay and I
 
07:10:52.548 --> 07:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
am speaking in favor of Bill uh House
 
07:10:54.770 --> 07:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
Bill 401
 
07:10:56.270 --> 07:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to state right off
 
07:10:58.910 --> 07:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
the bat here when we talk about we View
 
07:11:02.270 --> 07:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
housing as a supply issue or a tenants
 
07:11:04.610 --> 07:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
rights issue I like to say that it's
 
07:11:06.770 --> 07:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
both and I want to say that we need more
 
07:11:09.350 --> 07:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
Supply but also I think that tenants do
 
07:11:11.990 --> 07:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
need more rights in this current market
 
07:11:14.288 --> 07:11:14.298 align:start position:0%
I like to say that the lack of Supply
 
07:11:16.548 --> 07:11:16.558 align:start position:0%
exacerbates the lack of tenant rights
 
07:11:19.190 --> 07:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
that exist so I want to say yes and to
 
07:11:20.510 --> 07:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
that question of whether or not it's a
 
07:11:22.368 --> 07:11:22.378 align:start position:0%
supply issue
 
07:11:24.170 --> 07:11:24.180 align:start position:0%
um so a big reason why I'm speaking in
 
07:11:28.670 --> 07:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
favor today is again I work uh with many
 
07:11:32.208 --> 07:11:32.218 align:start position:0%
lone moderate income tenants and most
 
07:11:34.190 --> 07:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
commonly the most common form of
 
07:11:36.548 --> 07:11:36.558 align:start position:0%
eviction that our membership deals with
 
07:11:41.090 --> 07:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
is renovation and it is because this is
 
07:11:42.890 --> 07:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
a loophole around our just cause
 
07:11:45.770 --> 07:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
eviction laws we have had landlords in
 
07:11:47.868 --> 07:11:47.878 align:start position:0%
this room admit a public record that
 
07:11:50.150 --> 07:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
they use renovation evictions when they
 
07:11:52.788 --> 07:11:52.798 align:start position:0%
can't find another type of eviction to
 
07:11:54.410 --> 07:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
remove a tenant from
 
07:11:56.570 --> 07:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
so I feel that with the ease of an
 
07:11:58.310 --> 07:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
eviction that can come with a renovation
 
07:12:01.490 --> 07:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
eviction given this Market here we need
 
07:12:03.288 --> 07:12:03.298 align:start position:0%
these protections for the tenants in
 
07:12:03.298 --> 07:12:04.910 align:start position:0%
these protections for the tenants in
place

07:12:04.910 --> 07:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
place
 
07:12:07.310 --> 07:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
um and finally I do have one problem
 
07:12:09.170 --> 07:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
because I feel like there's one section
 
07:12:11.570 --> 07:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
in the bill that could possibly cause a
 
07:12:15.230 --> 07:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
supply issue and that is line 28. it
 
07:12:17.628 --> 07:12:17.638 align:start position:0%
says that the dwelling has to be off the
 
07:12:19.910 --> 07:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
market for 12 months I think that's a
 
07:12:21.468 --> 07:12:21.478 align:start position:0%
little too long I'm going to admit
 
07:12:23.150 --> 07:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
you're you're not going to hear me say
 
07:12:25.610 --> 07:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
that when it comes to giving more rice
 
07:12:27.770 --> 07:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
to tenants but I do feel like this could
 
07:12:31.250 --> 07:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
adversely affect the supply so I would
 
07:12:33.530 --> 07:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
probably recommend either a shorter time
 
07:12:36.708 --> 07:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
possibly six months or even a time
 
07:12:38.208 --> 07:12:38.218 align:start position:0%
that's estimated that the renovations
 
07:12:41.090 --> 07:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
would take because we have seen cases
 
07:12:43.968 --> 07:12:43.978 align:start position:0%
where somebody has been evicted for
 
07:12:46.548 --> 07:12:46.558 align:start position:0%
renovation the landlord did a new
 
07:12:48.650 --> 07:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
countertop and within 30 days somebody
 
07:12:50.208 --> 07:12:50.218 align:start position:0%
else was in there it was a renovation
 
07:12:52.430 --> 07:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
that the tenant could have stayed in for
 
07:12:55.070 --> 07:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh so I just want to make sure that when
 
07:12:56.750 --> 07:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
a tenant is being evicted for
 
07:12:59.390 --> 07:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
renovations that an actual renovation is
 
07:13:01.128 --> 07:13:01.138 align:start position:0%
happening and it's not just being used
 
07:13:03.490 --> 07:13:03.500 align:start position:0%
to style the side step a just cause
 
07:13:05.690 --> 07:13:05.700 align:start position:0%
eviction that we have
 
07:13:08.990 --> 07:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
and uh that's it I'll take any questions
 
07:13:11.270 --> 07:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
for this week
 
07:13:13.670 --> 07:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir thank you uh
 
07:13:19.810 --> 07:13:19.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:23.330 --> 07:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chairman
 
07:13:25.730 --> 07:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
so much has been said
 
07:13:28.610 --> 07:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
so a couple points there's a thought
 
07:13:32.270 --> 07:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
about 60 days notice
 
07:13:34.850 --> 07:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
but you must remember that tenants are
 
07:13:37.910 --> 07:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
only required to give a 30-day notice
 
07:13:39.410 --> 07:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
so think about it for just a quick
 
07:13:39.420 --> 07:13:40.968 align:start position:0%
so think about it for just a quick
minute

07:13:40.968 --> 07:13:40.978 align:start position:0%
minute
 
07:13:43.490 --> 07:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
what's on the market is tenants giving
 
07:13:46.190 --> 07:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
30-day notices
 
07:13:48.948 --> 07:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
so what use is it for a person getting
 
07:13:52.368 --> 07:13:52.378 align:start position:0%
60 days notice looking at things on the
 
07:13:53.990 --> 07:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
market which are not on the market yet
 
07:13:55.250 --> 07:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
because they haven't given notice
 
07:13:58.368 --> 07:13:58.378 align:start position:0%
because they're giving a 30-day notice
 
07:14:03.288 --> 07:14:03.298 align:start position:0%
it creates a false sense of
 
07:14:06.288 --> 07:14:06.298 align:start position:0%
decreased supply
 
07:14:10.368 --> 07:14:10.378 align:start position:0%
so it actually exacerbates the problem
 
07:14:13.128 --> 07:14:13.138 align:start position:0%
it's going to force more people
 
07:14:15.410 --> 07:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
looking for housing that doesn't yet
 
07:14:15.420 --> 07:14:16.968 align:start position:0%
looking for housing that doesn't yet
exist

07:14:16.968 --> 07:14:16.978 align:start position:0%
exist
 
07:14:19.788 --> 07:14:19.798 align:start position:0%
showing a higher demand which is going
 
07:14:22.190 --> 07:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
to push the rents higher
 
07:14:25.670 --> 07:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
so that that's just one point in this I
 
07:14:28.548 --> 07:14:28.558 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate that if we're looking
 
07:14:28.558 --> 07:14:30.770 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate that if we're looking
to

07:14:30.770 --> 07:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:14:34.250 --> 07:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
solve something related to the housing
 
07:14:36.530 --> 07:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
shortage and ease the shortage
 
07:14:38.750 --> 07:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
and you're not looking at creating more
 
07:14:40.910 --> 07:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
housing then you were looking in the
 
07:14:42.650 --> 07:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
wrong place
 
07:14:44.930 --> 07:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
we need to create more housing
 
07:14:47.448 --> 07:14:47.458 align:start position:0%
pure and simple and that will solve all
 
07:14:51.230 --> 07:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:53.690 --> 07:14:53.700 align:start position:0%
it's hard to know how long the
 
07:14:55.250 --> 07:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
renovation is going to take we have a
 
07:14:57.110 --> 07:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
lot of supply chain issues these days
 
07:14:59.208 --> 07:14:59.218 align:start position:0%
especially with the pandemic
 
07:15:01.910 --> 07:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
and when you have an eviction which
 
07:15:04.430 --> 07:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
already takes at least two months but in
 
07:15:07.310 --> 07:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
this case 30 days so add 21 days to that
 
07:15:09.110 --> 07:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
and then you add 30 more days to that
 
07:15:12.770 --> 07:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
it's a long time that you can have
 
07:15:16.310 --> 07:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh the apartment not producing money
 
07:15:19.250 --> 07:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
the tenant can easily not be paying rent
 
07:15:21.590 --> 07:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
and then the landlord goes through that
 
07:15:24.830 --> 07:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
longer and longer eviction process
 
07:15:26.690 --> 07:15:26.700 align:start position:0%
and then all that money has to be made
 
07:15:29.330 --> 07:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
up that's again pressure on increasing
 
07:15:29.340 --> 07:15:32.208 align:start position:0%
up that's again pressure on increasing
rents

07:15:32.208 --> 07:15:32.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:35.930 --> 07:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
I do want to say that
 
07:15:40.128 --> 07:15:40.138 align:start position:0%
we don't Advocate to landlords to use a
 
07:15:42.948 --> 07:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
renovation eviction as a means of
 
07:15:45.288 --> 07:15:45.298 align:start position:0%
getting rid of a tenant
 
07:15:48.830 --> 07:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
there are situations where
 
07:15:51.948 --> 07:15:51.958 align:start position:0%
you may be faced with a decision of
 
07:15:54.468 --> 07:15:54.478 align:start position:0%
living with a Troublesome tenant
 
07:15:57.590 --> 07:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
or actually doing a renovation
 
07:15:59.448 --> 07:15:59.458 align:start position:0%
and it makes sense as a business
 
07:16:02.090 --> 07:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
proposition for a property owner in some
 
07:16:04.968 --> 07:16:04.978 align:start position:0%
cases to do a renovation to
 
07:16:07.548 --> 07:16:07.558 align:start position:0%
significantly increase the value of that
 
07:16:07.558 --> 07:16:08.570 align:start position:0%
significantly increase the value of that
apartment

07:16:08.570 --> 07:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
07:16:13.010 --> 07:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
and then get a higher rent it's a good
 
07:16:15.170 --> 07:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
business proposal
 
07:16:15.180 --> 07:16:17.030 align:start position:0%
business proposal
and

07:16:17.030 --> 07:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:16:19.850 --> 07:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
I personally think it's a shame that we
 
07:16:22.208 --> 07:16:22.218 align:start position:0%
should be setting up a system that
 
07:16:25.850 --> 07:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
incentivizes property owners into doing
 
07:16:28.448 --> 07:16:28.458 align:start position:0%
renovations that will further increase
 
07:16:31.250 --> 07:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
the rents and make the situation even
 
07:16:31.260 --> 07:16:36.230 align:start position:0%
the rents and make the situation even
worse

07:16:36.230 --> 07:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:39.830 --> 07:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
I do know a very rare few cases where a
 
07:16:42.110 --> 07:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
landlord has chosen that option and they
 
07:16:44.208 --> 07:16:44.218 align:start position:0%
actually do the renovation they do a
 
07:16:46.430 --> 07:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
significant renovation and of course
 
07:16:49.190 --> 07:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
they have a much higher rent and you
 
07:16:50.810 --> 07:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
know what consequently they have less
 
07:16:53.208 --> 07:16:53.218 align:start position:0%
Troublesome tenants usually
 
07:16:55.850 --> 07:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
and so you know
 
07:16:58.250 --> 07:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
right this the there's there's a lot
 
07:16:59.628 --> 07:16:59.638 align:start position:0%
more to say
 
07:17:02.750 --> 07:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
um but I know that you're short on time
 
07:17:04.070 --> 07:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
um there is
 
07:17:05.750 --> 07:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
I guess I guess I'll stop with that
 
07:17:07.310 --> 07:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more to say and I would be
 
07:17:08.990 --> 07:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
really happy to take questions all right
 
07:17:12.650 --> 07:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
questions for for this Witness
 
07:17:14.150 --> 07:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much Mr
 
07:17:20.510 --> 07:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:22.430 --> 07:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
my name is David Klein and I promise you
 
07:17:23.628 --> 07:17:23.638 align:start position:0%
this will be the last time you'll hear
 
07:17:24.770 --> 07:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
from me today
 
07:17:27.530 --> 07:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
I want to go home too
 
07:17:29.208 --> 07:17:29.218 align:start position:0%
um I am against the bill because I have
 
07:17:31.190 --> 07:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
problems with it
 
07:17:33.948 --> 07:17:33.958 align:start position:0%
um starting out with describe the
 
07:17:36.350 --> 07:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
specificity that the work what work is
 
07:17:37.430 --> 07:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
going to be done I don't mind giving
 
07:17:40.070 --> 07:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
that but understand every time we go
 
07:17:42.048 --> 07:17:42.058 align:start position:0%
into some of these projects they expand
 
07:17:43.968 --> 07:17:43.978 align:start position:0%
on us we always find something else
 
07:17:46.730 --> 07:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
wrong and it's more work and we can't
 
07:17:48.288 --> 07:17:48.298 align:start position:0%
put it all down and I don't want to be
 
07:17:50.208 --> 07:17:50.218 align:start position:0%
locked into that
 
07:17:52.788 --> 07:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
but I have more problems with the proof
 
07:17:55.670 --> 07:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
that I have to give in order to evict a
 
07:17:57.650 --> 07:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
tenant one the work cannot be done
 
07:18:00.048 --> 07:18:00.058 align:start position:0%
safely that's not a real clear term
 
07:18:03.048 --> 07:18:03.058 align:start position:0%
because safely varies from situation to
 
07:18:06.048 --> 07:18:06.058 align:start position:0%
situation you have young children but
 
07:18:07.670 --> 07:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to be splinters when you
 
07:18:10.490 --> 07:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
pull a window out is that safe for the
 
07:18:13.128 --> 07:18:13.138 align:start position:0%
child or not it's very subjective it's
 
07:18:15.890 --> 07:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
very difficult to to work with that
 
07:18:18.650 --> 07:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
work being more than 30 days does that
 
07:18:20.150 --> 07:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
mean that you can't get the contractor
 
07:18:22.250 --> 07:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
in for 30 days or does the contract
 
07:18:24.110 --> 07:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
actually physically in the apartment for
 
07:18:27.048 --> 07:18:27.058 align:start position:0%
30 days 30 days of people working in
 
07:18:29.090 --> 07:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
that apartment is a lot of work we're
 
07:18:30.530 --> 07:18:30.540 align:start position:0%
supposed to tear these things down to
 
07:18:32.628 --> 07:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
the studs resheet rocket and then put up
 
07:18:35.270 --> 07:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
all new fixtures it it's not a clear
 
07:18:37.548 --> 07:18:37.558 align:start position:0%
term it's not a fair term
 
07:18:39.590 --> 07:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
than the one that really gets me is
 
07:18:41.868 --> 07:18:41.878 align:start position:0%
having to find a unit with a similar
 
07:18:41.878 --> 07:18:44.270 align:start position:0%
having to find a unit with a similar
rent

07:18:44.270 --> 07:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:46.190 --> 07:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
first of all what happens if the tenant
 
07:18:47.948 --> 07:18:47.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't like the unit you don't you find
 
07:18:50.868 --> 07:18:50.878 align:start position:0%
second where does that unit have to be
 
07:18:53.390 --> 07:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
can I get one in Alabama for this tenant
 
07:18:54.830 --> 07:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
or does it have to be in the same city
 
07:18:57.530 --> 07:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
or same state nothing is specified on
 
07:19:01.548 --> 07:19:01.558 align:start position:0%
this it's very ambiguous it's and
 
07:19:03.770 --> 07:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
would you like someone else finding a
 
07:19:05.330 --> 07:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
house for you or an apartment for you
 
07:19:06.948 --> 07:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
don't you want tenants to find their own
 
07:19:09.288 --> 07:19:09.298 align:start position:0%
and find something they're happy with I
 
07:19:10.788 --> 07:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
think it's these these qualifications
 
07:19:13.070 --> 07:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
are just ridiculous should not be put
 
07:19:14.868 --> 07:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
through and
 
07:19:16.368 --> 07:19:16.378 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to ask that you do not go
 
07:19:19.250 --> 07:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
through this bill I also agree that that
 
07:19:21.770 --> 07:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
on the taking off the market why do we
 
07:19:23.150 --> 07:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
want to incentivize people to keep
 
07:19:24.350 --> 07:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
Apartments when we're short of
 
07:19:25.850 --> 07:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
apartments off the market for a year
 
07:19:28.128 --> 07:19:28.138 align:start position:0%
that's way too long
 
07:19:30.350 --> 07:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
business reasons maybe you empty the
 
07:19:32.930 --> 07:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
building because the new owner wants it
 
07:19:34.850 --> 07:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
emptied and the new owner wants to take
 
07:19:36.650 --> 07:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
it over within six months and which is
 
07:19:38.868 --> 07:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
not an absurd amount of time for a
 
07:19:41.090 --> 07:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
purchasing sale of a small building a
 
07:19:42.770 --> 07:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
year is way too long you're going to
 
07:19:44.270 --> 07:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
keep these four units off the market
 
07:19:47.830 --> 07:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
that that provision is uh
 
07:19:49.788 --> 07:19:49.798 align:start position:0%
unacceptable to me
 
07:19:54.830 --> 07:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
and I also finally the six-month rule
 
07:19:54.840 --> 07:19:55.670 align:start position:0%
and I also finally the six-month rule
um

07:19:55.670 --> 07:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:19:58.128 --> 07:19:58.138 align:start position:0%
it's not easy to line up contractors
 
07:19:58.138 --> 07:19:59.150 align:start position:0%
it's not easy to line up contractors
today

07:19:59.150 --> 07:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
today
 
07:20:01.490 --> 07:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
you're telling a contract well you might
 
07:20:03.650 --> 07:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
be able to start in six months maybe
 
07:20:06.530 --> 07:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
eight or nine once I get this tenant out
 
07:20:08.868 --> 07:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
the contract is going to say call me
 
07:20:11.090 --> 07:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
when you've got it empty and I'll get to
 
07:20:13.610 --> 07:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
you when I can that means that unit's
 
07:20:15.410 --> 07:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
going to be off the market even longer
 
07:20:16.730 --> 07:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
because you never know when those
 
07:20:17.930 --> 07:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
contractors are going to be available
 
07:20:20.570 --> 07:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
and If and for those of you who don't
 
07:20:22.670 --> 07:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
have property try and get a plumber
 
07:20:24.350 --> 07:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
for long term
 
07:20:26.448 --> 07:20:26.458 align:start position:0%
there are shortage of plumbers shortage
 
07:20:28.368 --> 07:20:28.378 align:start position:0%
of electricians shortage of Carpenters
 
07:20:29.690 --> 07:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
what do you think the cost of
 
07:20:31.430 --> 07:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
construction is so high and the cost of
 
07:20:34.310 --> 07:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
building more housing is so high so
 
07:20:36.410 --> 07:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
that that's too long you got to bring it
 
07:20:38.570 --> 07:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
back I think the existing law with the
 
07:20:40.310 --> 07:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
90 days plus all the time it takes to
 
07:20:41.448 --> 07:20:41.458 align:start position:0%
get through the eviction which is
 
07:20:44.868 --> 07:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
another another 30 to 60 days minimum is
 
07:20:46.250 --> 07:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
more than adequate for protection for
 
07:20:48.350 --> 07:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
the tenants thank you for listening to
 
07:20:49.670 --> 07:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
me and I'll take any questions questions
 
07:20:52.128 --> 07:20:52.138 align:start position:0%
for this witness representative Morgan
 
07:20:52.138 --> 07:20:53.330 align:start position:0%
for this witness representative Morgan
um

07:20:53.330 --> 07:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:20:55.788 --> 07:20:55.798 align:start position:0%
this is a basically the same question I
 
07:20:57.650 --> 07:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
asked Mr bacon from the Realtors but
 
07:20:59.750 --> 07:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
you're an attorney and you flank things
 
07:21:01.730 --> 07:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
pretty clearly so hopefully I can ask
 
07:21:03.650 --> 07:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
you clearly
 
07:21:05.868 --> 07:21:05.878 align:start position:0%
um what let's say let's say I'm in the
 
07:21:08.330 --> 07:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
situation where I buy you know a
 
07:21:11.570 --> 07:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
renovated building that the uh you know
 
07:21:14.390 --> 07:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
the previous owner assures me it's been
 
07:21:16.788 --> 07:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
empty for 12 months and um
 
07:21:19.010 --> 07:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
so then I buy it and then the previous
 
07:21:21.048 --> 07:21:21.058 align:start position:0%
Tenors tenants could theoretically then
 
07:21:24.288 --> 07:21:24.298 align:start position:0%
hit somebody up for ten thousand dollars
 
07:21:27.890 --> 07:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
um ten thousand dollars uh each if what
 
07:21:29.868 --> 07:21:29.878 align:start position:0%
I was told wasn't true so how do I
 
07:21:32.628 --> 07:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
protect myself do is it do I
 
07:21:35.390 --> 07:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
do I have to sue the previous owner or
 
07:21:37.368 --> 07:21:37.378 align:start position:0%
should I or during what I'm doing the
 
07:21:39.830 --> 07:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
sale should I try to get an insurance an
 
07:21:42.890 --> 07:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
affidavit from the buyer or do I even or
 
07:21:44.448 --> 07:21:44.458 align:start position:0%
is it possible for me to even go down to
 
07:21:47.330 --> 07:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
the courthouse maybe and check to see if
 
07:21:49.070 --> 07:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
there's been any evictions at that
 
07:21:51.708 --> 07:21:51.718 align:start position:0%
addressed during um the last year or so
 
07:21:52.910 --> 07:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
so how do I
 
07:21:55.368 --> 07:21:55.378 align:start position:0%
how do uh buyers protect themselves in
 
07:21:58.070 --> 07:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
that situation I'm gonna Back start off
 
07:21:59.390 --> 07:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
with the courthouse
 
07:22:01.910 --> 07:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
if you give notice to get out and the
 
07:22:03.770 --> 07:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
tenant moves out voluntarily without
 
07:22:06.048 --> 07:22:06.058 align:start position:0%
going through the eviction process then
 
07:22:07.128 --> 07:22:07.138 align:start position:0%
there will be nothing in the courthouse
 
07:22:09.170 --> 07:22:09.180 align:start position:0%
so that would not help unless there's an
 
07:22:11.030 --> 07:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
eviction file because the tenant did not
 
07:22:12.410 --> 07:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
get out
 
07:22:16.250 --> 07:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
I would get an affidavit from the seller
 
07:22:18.530 --> 07:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
that similar to the affidavits we see
 
07:22:20.090 --> 07:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
with title insurance that there are no
 
07:22:23.330 --> 07:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
encroachments with no tenants tennis and
 
07:22:25.730 --> 07:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
possession of unrecorded leases of that
 
07:22:27.830 --> 07:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
type of nature uh to protect yourself
 
07:22:31.070 --> 07:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
and then you can sue based on fraud
 
07:22:33.650 --> 07:22:33.660 align:start position:0%
or something along that lines that would
 
07:22:35.750 --> 07:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
be my suggestion but I would do it at
 
07:22:37.430 --> 07:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
the time in the sale with the purchase
 
07:22:40.310 --> 07:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
and sale agreement okay good thanks that
 
07:22:41.868 --> 07:22:41.878 align:start position:0%
sounds good to me thank you all right
 
07:22:43.910 --> 07:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
07:22:45.708 --> 07:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much sir
 
07:22:56.448 --> 07:22:56.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:59.510 --> 07:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
hi again hi uh so as I said earlier I'm
 
07:23:01.070 --> 07:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
a housing lawyer at New Hampshire legal
 
07:23:02.810 --> 07:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
assistants I'm handing around letters
 
07:23:05.090 --> 07:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
from uh the owner of Stewart Property
 
07:23:06.948 --> 07:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
Management which is a for-profit
 
07:23:08.690 --> 07:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
landlord who supports this bill I
 
07:23:11.390 --> 07:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
believe they also submitted that online
 
07:23:13.128 --> 07:23:13.138 align:start position:0%
um I just want to start by clarifying
 
07:23:15.110 --> 07:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
some misinformation about the law that
 
07:23:17.390 --> 07:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
has been provided during testimony so
 
07:23:19.010 --> 07:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
one thing that someone said earlier was
 
07:23:21.288 --> 07:23:21.298 align:start position:0%
that people can't be evicted for
 
07:23:23.750 --> 07:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
renovations during a lease term that is
 
07:23:26.150 --> 07:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely not true people are
 
07:23:28.310 --> 07:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
constantly evicted during lease terms
 
07:23:30.230 --> 07:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
for renovations that's the whole reason
 
07:23:32.030 --> 07:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
why landlords use this as a loophole
 
07:23:34.190 --> 07:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
because they don't have to prove
 
07:23:36.350 --> 07:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
anything at this point a judge can ask
 
07:23:38.150 --> 07:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
questions but they have no requirement
 
07:23:39.830 --> 07:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
to ask questions about what the
 
07:23:42.048 --> 07:23:42.058 align:start position:0%
renovation is what the nature of the
 
07:23:43.150 --> 07:23:43.160 align:start position:0%
plan is
 
07:23:46.730 --> 07:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
in 2022 compared to 2021 at New
 
07:23:49.330 --> 07:23:49.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance we had a 43
 
07:23:52.250 --> 07:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
increase in intakes for evictions for
 
07:23:56.090 --> 07:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
renovation from 2022 to to 2021
 
07:23:58.548 --> 07:23:58.558 align:start position:0%
and we weren't able to help 17 of the
 
07:24:00.530 --> 07:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
people that that came to us for help
 
07:24:01.968 --> 07:24:01.978 align:start position:0%
because we just don't have capacity
 
07:24:04.250 --> 07:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
which should hopefully show you that
 
07:24:06.350 --> 07:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
there's just not enough resources in the
 
07:24:09.288 --> 07:24:09.298 align:start position:0%
state to deal with this problem
 
07:24:12.350 --> 07:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
um right now I think I forget which rep
 
07:24:13.850 --> 07:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
asked earlier and I apologize but
 
07:24:15.530 --> 07:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
someone said why do we need this right
 
07:24:17.390 --> 07:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
now the reason that we need this is
 
07:24:19.310 --> 07:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
because rental housing is extremely hard
 
07:24:21.770 --> 07:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
to find and it's very unfortunate but
 
07:24:23.750 --> 07:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
landlords are using this the fact that
 
07:24:25.850 --> 07:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
you can evict to renovate as a loophole
 
07:24:28.190 --> 07:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
and it's a trend that we have seen
 
07:24:30.350 --> 07:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
through our numbers changing increasing
 
07:24:32.690 --> 07:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
in these types of ink intakes it's
 
07:24:34.430 --> 07:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
trending it's becoming more commonly
 
07:24:37.190 --> 07:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
known about and it's become becoming
 
07:24:39.890 --> 07:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
more commonly abused uh representative
 
07:24:41.390 --> 07:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
Lynn said earlier when he was speaking
 
07:24:43.128 --> 07:24:43.138 align:start position:0%
about his bill that it we should be
 
07:24:45.530 --> 07:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
looking out for bills sorry laws that
 
07:24:47.090 --> 07:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
landlords can manipulate and we don't
 
07:24:49.070 --> 07:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
want people doing that well I'm we're
 
07:24:50.930 --> 07:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
all talking to you or those of us who
 
07:24:52.730 --> 07:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
support this bill are talking to you
 
07:24:55.670 --> 07:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
about Allah right now that doesn't exist
 
07:24:58.010 --> 07:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
that allows landlords to manipulate the
 
07:24:59.930 --> 07:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
law and kick people out in the middle of
 
07:25:02.330 --> 07:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
a lease term and not renovate so you've
 
07:25:03.288 --> 07:25:03.298 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of people talk about
 
07:25:05.150 --> 07:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
legitimate Renovations I'm now going to
 
07:25:06.590 --> 07:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
tell you about clients that couldn't be
 
07:25:08.270 --> 07:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
here today because it's too expensive to
 
07:25:10.548 --> 07:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
get a cab here who have been evicted for
 
07:25:12.770 --> 07:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
renovations and whose landlords don't
 
07:25:14.868 --> 07:25:14.878 align:start position:0%
actually renovate the property one
 
07:25:16.968 --> 07:25:16.978 align:start position:0%
gentleman who was living in Exeter and
 
07:25:19.128 --> 07:25:19.138 align:start position:0%
was evicted four Renovations had always
 
07:25:20.990 --> 07:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
paid his rent on time his name is tilo
 
07:25:22.850 --> 07:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
scheller he wanted to be here but he
 
07:25:24.830 --> 07:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't make it he lived in his
 
07:25:26.930 --> 07:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
apartment for five years paid rent every
 
07:25:29.030 --> 07:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
month on time landlord gave an eviction
 
07:25:31.310 --> 07:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
for renovations we came to an agreement
 
07:25:33.350 --> 07:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
he moved out three days later the
 
07:25:35.150 --> 07:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
apartments on Craigslist having just
 
07:25:38.390 --> 07:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
been painted and this eviction type of
 
07:25:40.368 --> 07:25:40.378 align:start position:0%
eviction is only supposed to be done for
 
07:25:42.230 --> 07:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
substantial renovation that can't happen
 
07:25:44.628 --> 07:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
when the tenants living there so
 
07:25:47.390 --> 07:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
codifying this at law would make it so
 
07:25:49.610 --> 07:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
that the court every single judge would
 
07:25:51.830 --> 07:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
ask the questions about what are you
 
07:25:53.390 --> 07:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
doing for this renovation right now they
 
07:25:54.770 --> 07:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
don't have to and the courts are very
 
07:25:56.030 --> 07:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
overburdened so they're getting through
 
07:25:58.250 --> 07:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
cases as quickly as possible when we go
 
07:26:00.048 --> 07:26:00.058 align:start position:0%
on a Wednesday to Manchester District
 
07:26:02.448 --> 07:26:02.458 align:start position:0%
Court or a Thursday rather now there
 
07:26:05.510 --> 07:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
will be 15 cases scheduled at 8 45 a.m
 
07:26:07.010 --> 07:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
and they're all landlord-tenant
 
07:26:08.930 --> 07:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
evictions they're not all get getting
 
07:26:11.150 --> 07:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
the time to have these questions asked
 
07:26:13.250 --> 07:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
and if these were required to be asked
 
07:26:14.930 --> 07:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
by the court then the court would ask
 
07:26:16.490 --> 07:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
them and I don't think that we should
 
07:26:17.750 --> 07:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
expect that each judge would
 
07:26:20.150 --> 07:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
individually put it upon themselves to
 
07:26:21.770 --> 07:26:21.780 align:start position:0%
inquire about things that aren't really
 
07:26:24.468 --> 07:26:24.478 align:start position:0%
required of them to be asked
 
07:26:24.478 --> 07:26:25.310 align:start position:0%
required of them to be asked
um

07:26:25.310 --> 07:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:26:28.250 --> 07:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
this the bill only applies to restricted
 
07:26:29.810 --> 07:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
housing it's not applying to the
 
07:26:32.330 --> 07:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
mom-and-pop landlords it's not applying
 
07:26:34.128 --> 07:26:34.138 align:start position:0%
to any Renovations that are required to
 
07:26:36.948 --> 07:26:36.958 align:start position:0%
address code violations or affecting the
 
07:26:39.948 --> 07:26:39.958 align:start position:0%
lead laws evictions you were given an
 
07:26:41.390 --> 07:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
eviction notice and I'm sorry I'm
 
07:26:42.708 --> 07:26:42.718 align:start position:0%
rushing I just know it's the end of the
 
07:26:45.110 --> 07:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
day and I really want to make this call
 
07:26:47.270 --> 07:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
clear earlier today during
 
07:26:49.010 --> 07:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn's bill you were
 
07:26:50.570 --> 07:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
handed out a copy of a blank eviction
 
07:26:52.250 --> 07:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
notice I would love for you to take a
 
07:26:53.810 --> 07:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
look at that and get familiar with it
 
07:26:55.610 --> 07:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
because I would assume that many people
 
07:26:58.910 --> 07:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
sitting up here do not rent apartments
 
07:27:00.468 --> 07:27:00.478 align:start position:0%
um I rent an apartment but I had not
 
07:27:02.030 --> 07:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
seen an eviction notice but like till I
 
07:27:03.650 --> 07:27:03.660 align:start position:0%
became a housing lawyer so look at it
 
07:27:05.930 --> 07:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
get familiar with it it's very clear
 
07:27:07.250 --> 07:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
when you look at that document that
 
07:27:09.468 --> 07:27:09.478 align:start position:0%
there's so many different ways that a
 
07:27:11.570 --> 07:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
landlord can evict a tenant during a
 
07:27:12.650 --> 07:27:12.660 align:start position:0%
lease term that's what we're talking
 
07:27:14.030 --> 07:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
about we're not talking about the end of
 
07:27:16.548 --> 07:27:16.558 align:start position:0%
a lease during a lease term if they
 
07:27:18.708 --> 07:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
materially violate the lease they can
 
07:27:21.048 --> 07:27:21.058 align:start position:0%
evict with 30 days notice if there's a
 
07:27:24.230 --> 07:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
behavior that is adversely affecting
 
07:27:26.030 --> 07:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
health or safety they can give a seven
 
07:27:28.250 --> 07:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
day notice for an eviction if they stop
 
07:27:30.110 --> 07:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
paying rent during a discretionary stay
 
07:27:32.090 --> 07:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
they would be kicked out the sixth
 
07:27:33.830 --> 07:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
period six month period of discretionary
 
07:27:35.628 --> 07:27:35.638 align:start position:0%
stay extending it from three months to
 
07:27:38.270 --> 07:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
six months the tenant has to pay that
 
07:27:39.948 --> 07:27:39.958 align:start position:0%
entire time and if they don't they will
 
07:27:41.810 --> 07:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
be kicked out and the same thing would
 
07:27:41.820 --> 07:27:42.770 align:start position:0%
be kicked out and the same thing would
happen

07:27:42.770 --> 07:27:42.780 align:start position:0%
happen
 
07:27:46.368 --> 07:27:46.378 align:start position:0%
um in terms of and at any time during a
 
07:27:48.708 --> 07:27:48.718 align:start position:0%
lease or during a stay or anything like
 
07:27:51.048 --> 07:27:51.058 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't foreclose on the
 
07:27:53.390 --> 07:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
landlord's ability to file an eviction
 
07:27:55.190 --> 07:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
for any of those other very legitimate
 
07:27:57.110 --> 07:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
reasons and the law exists for a reason
 
07:27:59.628 --> 07:27:59.638 align:start position:0%
I have a client right now who's disabled
 
07:28:01.670 --> 07:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
whose landlord is doing very legitimate
 
07:28:03.650 --> 07:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
Renovations and we've been working with
 
07:28:06.288 --> 07:28:06.298 align:start position:0%
them so that the client who needs
 
07:28:08.510 --> 07:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
Supportive Housing and so the landlord
 
07:28:10.548 --> 07:28:10.558 align:start position:0%
has been very accommodating they've
 
07:28:12.350 --> 07:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
worked with us they've given him plenty
 
07:28:14.330 --> 07:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
of time I think the letter I handed out
 
07:28:15.890 --> 07:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
from Stewart Property Management says
 
07:28:17.868 --> 07:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
that they usually take about six to nine
 
07:28:19.548 --> 07:28:19.558 align:start position:0%
months to figure out what units they're
 
07:28:21.788 --> 07:28:21.798 align:start position:0%
going to renovate get the contractors
 
07:28:23.810 --> 07:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
someone was just saying how hard it is
 
07:28:25.490 --> 07:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
to get a plumber or something you know
 
07:28:27.048 --> 07:28:27.058 align:start position:0%
I've needed one in my apartment for like
 
07:28:28.190 --> 07:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
a month and a half and I have a great
 
07:28:29.930 --> 07:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
landlord and it's just scheduling right
 
07:28:31.548 --> 07:28:31.558 align:start position:0%
so if you're going to renovate your
 
07:28:33.350 --> 07:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
property you probably know more than 30
 
07:28:35.750 --> 07:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
days in advance and so all we're asking
 
07:28:38.628 --> 07:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
is for people to give 60 days notice
 
07:28:41.330 --> 07:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
again that just means I want to renovate
 
07:28:43.788 --> 07:28:43.798 align:start position:0%
in 60 days so please leave then and if
 
07:28:46.070 --> 07:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
you do 2 then I won't file an eviction
 
07:28:48.770 --> 07:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
so you everybody keeps talking about how
 
07:28:49.968 --> 07:28:49.978 align:start position:0%
they get all this extra time in the
 
07:28:52.490 --> 07:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
court process if your goal is to have
 
07:28:54.170 --> 07:28:54.180 align:start position:0%
tenants avoid going through the court
 
07:28:56.628 --> 07:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
process then give them more time so that
 
07:28:57.948 --> 07:28:57.958 align:start position:0%
they have more time to look for an
 
07:28:59.990 --> 07:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
apartment and then if that's not enough
 
07:29:02.510 --> 07:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
they the judge would be able to give
 
07:29:04.430 --> 07:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
them up to six months of a discretionary
 
07:29:06.830 --> 07:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
stay and again the court process takes
 
07:29:08.090 --> 07:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
as long as the court process takes
 
07:29:09.230 --> 07:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're talking about
 
07:29:10.850 --> 07:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
right now we're talking about the timing
 
07:29:13.070 --> 07:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
of when an eviction notice expires and
 
07:29:15.170 --> 07:29:15.180 align:start position:0%
again it just I just want to reiterate
 
07:29:17.208 --> 07:29:17.218 align:start position:0%
that this is a trend that's happening
 
07:29:19.788 --> 07:29:19.798 align:start position:0%
that you know you I think have a
 
07:29:22.190 --> 07:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility to look at the laws that
 
07:29:24.048 --> 07:29:24.058 align:start position:0%
are put in front of you and how you're
 
07:29:26.030 --> 07:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
hearing from all of us or for many of us
 
07:29:28.010 --> 07:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
that they're being manipulated you can
 
07:29:30.230 --> 07:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
read articles about it in the paper so
 
07:29:31.730 --> 07:29:31.740 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you to please do something
 
07:29:33.650 --> 07:29:33.660 align:start position:0%
about that so tenants can have more time
 
07:29:35.930 --> 07:29:35.940 align:start position:0%
when they've done nothing wrong and
 
07:29:37.010 --> 07:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
don't want to have to go through an
 
07:29:38.510 --> 07:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
eviction or if they do have to go
 
07:29:40.310 --> 07:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
through an eviction give them more time
 
07:29:42.590 --> 07:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
to find a place and one more point of
 
07:29:45.048 --> 07:29:45.058 align:start position:0%
clarification then I'll stop is that the
 
07:29:46.670 --> 07:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
landlord does not have to find a new
 
07:29:47.930 --> 07:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
apartment for the tenant there's
 
07:29:49.490 --> 07:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
absolutely no requirement for that it
 
07:29:50.868 --> 07:29:50.878 align:start position:0%
says that
 
07:29:53.690 --> 07:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
um line 15 says that the tenant has been
 
07:29:55.490 --> 07:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
offered a dwelling unit within the same
 
07:29:57.890 --> 07:29:57.900 align:start position:0%
with the same number of bedrooms
 
07:29:59.628 --> 07:29:59.638 align:start position:0%
um from which they're being evicted uh
 
07:30:02.150 --> 07:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
sorry line 17 says this provision shall
 
07:30:03.948 --> 07:30:03.958 align:start position:0%
not apply if no such unit is available
 
07:30:06.468 --> 07:30:06.478 align:start position:0%
what that's talking about is if you have
 
07:30:08.390 --> 07:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
a multi-unit property and there's a
 
07:30:10.250 --> 07:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
vacant unit and the tenants unit is the
 
07:30:11.330 --> 07:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
one that's going to be renovated we're
 
07:30:13.250 --> 07:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
saying if there's a vacant unit offer
 
07:30:14.448 --> 07:30:14.458 align:start position:0%
the vacant unit to the tenant because
 
07:30:16.250 --> 07:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
right now that's not required so that's
 
07:30:18.048 --> 07:30:18.058 align:start position:0%
that's what that's addressing all right
 
07:30:21.190 --> 07:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
questions for this win
 
07:30:23.330 --> 07:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to amend it since that's
 
07:30:24.830 --> 07:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
not what it says representative yeah
 
07:30:26.390 --> 07:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
that that's what I was going to say yeah
 
07:30:28.670 --> 07:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
that one provision the part about about
 
07:30:30.890 --> 07:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
having to offer another unit seems
 
07:30:33.048 --> 07:30:33.058 align:start position:0%
fairly open-ended in terms of the
 
07:30:35.510 --> 07:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
obligation that it's putting on the on
 
07:30:37.490 --> 07:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
the so I didn't know whether that was
 
07:30:38.868 --> 07:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
something that could be amended yeah and
 
07:30:39.948 --> 07:30:39.958 align:start position:0%
I think that's the thing we're very
 
07:30:42.708 --> 07:30:42.718 align:start position:0%
happy to clarify things the idea behind
 
07:30:44.448 --> 07:30:44.458 align:start position:0%
that is we're trying to use this to deal
 
07:30:46.310 --> 07:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
with protectual evictions that aren't
 
07:30:48.110 --> 07:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
really about renovation so the evictions
 
07:30:50.090 --> 07:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
I talked about like tilo sheller who his
 
07:30:51.410 --> 07:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
landlord evicted him and then didn't
 
07:30:53.570 --> 07:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
renovate the property the idea would be
 
07:30:55.190 --> 07:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
that if it's really about renovating
 
07:30:57.288 --> 07:30:57.298 align:start position:0%
that specific unit and you have an empty
 
07:30:59.690 --> 07:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
unit offer that unit to your tenant if
 
07:31:01.250 --> 07:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
this is not about anything other than
 
07:31:02.990 --> 07:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
renovation I think that that's just a
 
07:31:04.910 --> 07:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
logical way of doing it
 
07:31:07.010 --> 07:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
um so that we're happy to amend things
 
07:31:08.628 --> 07:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
we're happy to talk it through but
 
07:31:11.090 --> 07:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
please think about doing this other
 
07:31:14.030 --> 07:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness so I guess I
 
07:31:16.430 --> 07:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
I'm I really I mean you I really want to
 
07:31:17.570 --> 07:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
make sure that I'm understanding
 
07:31:20.868 --> 07:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
something are you saying that if I'm a
 
07:31:23.330 --> 07:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
landlord and I enter into a one-year
 
07:31:26.030 --> 07:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
lease with you and the lease agreement
 
07:31:28.490 --> 07:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about I can evict
 
07:31:30.830 --> 07:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
you because I want to renovate at the
 
07:31:34.368 --> 07:31:34.378 align:start position:0%
six-month term that the law allows you
 
07:31:36.530 --> 07:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
to allows me to break the contract
 
07:31:38.930 --> 07:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
correct it constitutes other good cause
 
07:31:40.270 --> 07:31:40.280 align:start position:0%
so so
 
07:31:43.368 --> 07:31:43.378 align:start position:0%
has that actually been decided by the
 
07:31:45.708 --> 07:31:45.718 align:start position:0%
Supreme the Supreme Court has said or a
 
07:31:49.010 --> 07:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
trial court has said you can use this
 
07:31:52.750 --> 07:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
provision to break a lease yes
 
07:31:54.770 --> 07:31:54.780 align:start position:0%
I guess we'll know I really want to take
 
07:31:57.288 --> 07:31:57.298 align:start position:0%
my name and reputation can you give us
 
07:31:59.208 --> 07:31:59.218 align:start position:0%
some of those right now you know what
 
07:32:00.830 --> 07:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
can you give us the cases that say
 
07:32:02.510 --> 07:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
because I'm just amazed at that there's
 
07:32:04.548 --> 07:32:04.558 align:start position:0%
not a specific case to my knowledge but
 
07:32:06.110 --> 07:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
the law does say that if it's a
 
07:32:07.910 --> 07:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
legitimate business or economic reason
 
07:32:10.010 --> 07:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
and I believe it's section two and I
 
07:32:11.750 --> 07:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
have my book right but I guess what I'm
 
07:32:13.070 --> 07:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
really sorry I mean I understand that
 
07:32:16.010 --> 07:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
but doesn't that that that would allow
 
07:32:19.910 --> 07:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
you to to invoke the landlord tenant
 
07:32:23.690 --> 07:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
process but if you but you I'm I would
 
07:32:26.270 --> 07:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
be amazed if you can use the landlord
 
07:32:29.288 --> 07:32:29.298 align:start position:0%
tenant process to break a contract
 
07:32:31.730 --> 07:32:31.740 align:start position:0%
think about if there's a material lease
 
07:32:33.708 --> 07:32:33.718 align:start position:0%
violation right so or if there's
 
07:32:35.208 --> 07:32:35.218 align:start position:0%
behavior that affects the health their
 
07:32:36.948 --> 07:32:36.958 align:start position:0%
safety of another tenant right so that's
 
07:32:38.868 --> 07:32:38.878 align:start position:0%
not probably in the least some specific
 
07:32:40.850 --> 07:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
random behavior that affects the health
 
07:32:44.090 --> 07:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
or safety the every single thing can't
 
07:32:46.010 --> 07:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
be contemplated in a contract would you
 
07:32:47.690 --> 07:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
agree with that I mean there's going to
 
07:32:49.190 --> 07:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
be things that the tenant like the guy
 
07:32:50.868 --> 07:32:50.878 align:start position:0%
who's leaving random harassing
 
07:32:53.510 --> 07:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
voicemails for example if that's not in
 
07:32:55.968 --> 07:32:55.978 align:start position:0%
the lease that specific thing there are
 
07:32:57.948 --> 07:32:57.958 align:start position:0%
steps that can be taken that you can
 
07:33:00.170 --> 07:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
file an eviction notice and you specify
 
07:33:02.390 --> 07:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
the behavior I'm just using this as an
 
07:33:04.968 --> 07:33:04.978 align:start position:0%
example not everything's contemplated no
 
07:33:06.170 --> 07:33:06.180 align:start position:0%
but I understand I would love for you to
 
07:33:07.730 --> 07:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
come to Manchester tomorrow and see it
 
07:33:09.230 --> 07:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
because but I guess you I'm not making
 
07:33:11.150 --> 07:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
this up no I'm not saying I guess what
 
07:33:12.530 --> 07:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
I'm really I'm not suggesting that
 
07:33:13.730 --> 07:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
you're making something up but I guess
 
07:33:15.948 --> 07:33:15.958 align:start position:0%
the thing I'm having real difficulty
 
07:33:18.468 --> 07:33:18.478 align:start position:0%
with is the other examples you gave the
 
07:33:21.048 --> 07:33:21.058 align:start position:0%
tenant is being disruptive other I mean
 
07:33:24.170 --> 07:33:24.180 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that those it's easy to
 
07:33:28.070 --> 07:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
understand why you are not being
 
07:33:30.410 --> 07:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
um you're not you're not carrying out
 
07:33:32.390 --> 07:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
your responsibilities as a tenant right
 
07:33:34.368 --> 07:33:34.378 align:start position:0%
and I guess I could even see if a
 
07:33:37.730 --> 07:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
landlord would say look if I don't you
 
07:33:39.890 --> 07:33:39.900 align:start position:0%
know if I don't fix if I don't make a
 
07:33:41.330 --> 07:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
renovation that
 
07:33:43.788 --> 07:33:43.798 align:start position:0%
somehow fixes the electrical system in
 
07:33:46.310 --> 07:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
your unit it's going to put the whole
 
07:33:48.650 --> 07:33:48.660 align:start position:0%
place in in danger I could understand
 
07:33:51.650 --> 07:33:51.660 align:start position:0%
saying that's a basis to to break the
 
07:33:54.830 --> 07:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
lease but if the landlord just says I
 
07:33:57.830 --> 07:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
want to you know I want to upgrade the
 
07:34:01.190 --> 07:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
property during at six months so I can
 
07:34:03.350 --> 07:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
get more money that's the grounds for
 
07:34:05.270 --> 07:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
breaking at least I I would really have
 
07:34:07.030 --> 07:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
to see a case that says that's okay
 
07:34:09.230 --> 07:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there's not a case and
 
07:34:10.968 --> 07:34:10.978 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here trying to change
 
07:34:13.190 --> 07:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
the law at the legislature so I think if
 
07:34:14.810 --> 07:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
you're outraged by that I would really
 
07:34:16.610 --> 07:34:16.620 align:start position:0%
encourage you to talk to us during the
 
07:34:18.410 --> 07:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
executive session so we can talk more
 
07:34:20.330 --> 07:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
because there's not case law and
 
07:34:21.948 --> 07:34:21.958 align:start position:0%
oftentimes there's not case law to
 
07:34:23.510 --> 07:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
support a practice that's happening well
 
07:34:25.250 --> 07:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
so let me just ask you this would it
 
07:34:27.590 --> 07:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
would it satisfy you then to the extent
 
07:34:29.448 --> 07:34:29.458 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about the would it
 
07:34:33.170 --> 07:34:33.180 align:start position:0%
satisfy you if we amended this bill to
 
07:34:35.868 --> 07:34:35.878 align:start position:0%
say the amended the appropriate section
 
07:34:38.350 --> 07:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
of the statute to say
 
07:34:38.360 --> 07:34:40.310 align:start position:0%
of the statute to say
renovation

07:34:40.310 --> 07:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
renovation
 
07:34:40.320 --> 07:34:41.890 align:start position:0%
renovation
uh

07:34:41.890 --> 07:34:41.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:34:45.170 --> 07:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
renovation but not during the lease term
 
07:34:47.330 --> 07:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
is okay I think that that would sort of
 
07:34:49.850 --> 07:34:49.860 align:start position:0%
invoke me having to give a position on
 
07:34:53.150 --> 07:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
117 and I don't know that and I'm not
 
07:34:55.190 --> 07:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
trying to be disrespectful I just I
 
07:34:56.750 --> 07:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
don't know that it's that simple but
 
07:34:58.610 --> 07:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
what I do know is you know I've only
 
07:34:59.990 --> 07:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
been doing this for a couple of years
 
07:35:02.448 --> 07:35:02.458 align:start position:0%
and I think last year I testified that I
 
07:35:04.610 --> 07:35:04.620 align:start position:0%
had like five cases in six months for
 
07:35:06.890 --> 07:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
renovation like I just said we've had a
 
07:35:10.968 --> 07:35:10.978 align:start position:0%
43 in increase between 2022 and 2021 for
 
07:35:13.128 --> 07:35:13.138 align:start position:0%
this so I'm talking about this Based on
 
07:35:15.230 --> 07:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
data from our non-profit organization
 
07:35:17.510 --> 07:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
and we we keep lots of data because we
 
07:35:19.430 --> 07:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
get government government money so I
 
07:35:21.410 --> 07:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
promise we have good data
 
07:35:24.708 --> 07:35:24.718 align:start position:0%
um you know I understand that it seems
 
07:35:26.628 --> 07:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and that's why we're sitting
 
07:35:27.890 --> 07:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
here trying to change it so
 
07:35:29.690 --> 07:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I can't point to a case
 
07:35:32.390 --> 07:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
but I can point to the reality and I I
 
07:35:34.368 --> 07:35:34.378 align:start position:0%
mean as some have you or other people
 
07:35:36.530 --> 07:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
from legal assistance made the argument
 
07:35:39.468 --> 07:35:39.478 align:start position:0%
to a judge you can't you can't allow
 
07:35:41.810 --> 07:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
this renovation to be made during the
 
07:35:43.850 --> 07:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
the middle of the term yeah so I mean
 
07:35:46.430 --> 07:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
yes and the response is this is a
 
07:35:48.890 --> 07:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
business economic reason and it's a
 
07:35:50.390 --> 07:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
renovation that cannot be done while the
 
07:35:51.650 --> 07:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
person's in the property I believe it's
 
07:35:53.690 --> 07:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
5 40 section two
 
07:35:54.948 --> 07:35:54.958 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know I can look through
 
07:35:56.510 --> 07:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
and find it but we could also chat after
 
07:35:59.150 --> 07:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
but you know this is a very very very
 
07:36:01.310 --> 07:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
common practice and I think it was said
 
07:36:03.770 --> 07:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
earlier that it needs to be a practice
 
07:36:06.048 --> 07:36:06.058 align:start position:0%
you know by these landlords so that they
 
07:36:07.670 --> 07:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
can get people out when it's a problem
 
07:36:09.890 --> 07:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
and yes you know we're not saying that
 
07:36:11.448 --> 07:36:11.458 align:start position:0%
that's always what happens but it's what
 
07:36:13.250 --> 07:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
happens sometimes and it only takes one
 
07:36:15.708 --> 07:36:15.718 align:start position:0%
person being evicted like tilo sheller
 
07:36:18.170 --> 07:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
and the many other clients that I have
 
07:36:19.730 --> 07:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
worked with who weren't comfortable
 
07:36:22.548 --> 07:36:22.558 align:start position:0%
having me share their names uh but I
 
07:36:23.930 --> 07:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
really urge you to think about this
 
07:36:25.910 --> 07:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
you've welcome to ask us questions you
 
07:36:27.948 --> 07:36:27.958 align:start position:0%
know come to a clinic with us if you
 
07:36:30.288 --> 07:36:30.298 align:start position:0%
really want to see this in action come
 
07:36:32.448 --> 07:36:32.458 align:start position:0%
see how many cases there are come see
 
07:36:34.128 --> 07:36:34.138 align:start position:0%
how often renovation is used as a
 
07:36:38.750 --> 07:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
loophole and how regularly uh it is it
 
07:36:40.548 --> 07:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
is allowed through as a good cause of
 
07:36:42.770 --> 07:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
action and yes the Court can give a
 
07:36:44.750 --> 07:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
discretionary shave up to 90 days I
 
07:36:46.670 --> 07:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
would say what I've observed and again
 
07:36:49.010 --> 07:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
I'm one person who's had limited
 
07:36:50.990 --> 07:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
experience it is more accommodated about
 
07:36:53.270 --> 07:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
a 30-day stay
 
07:36:55.548 --> 07:36:55.558 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
07:36:59.510 --> 07:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you so much
 
07:37:00.770 --> 07:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
