foreign

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
so we can get the uh
 
00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 align:start position:0%
it is now 10 15 and welcome to
 
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
its abbreviation is CFL
 
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
if you came thinking this is a meeting
 
00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 align:start position:0%
of the Canadian Football League you're
 
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
in the wrong room this is children and
 
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 align:start position:0%
family law
 
00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 align:start position:0%
couple items from the chair as we begin
 
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
many of you new to the house went
 
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 align:start position:0%
through some training on raising your
 
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 align:start position:0%
hand in order to speak and how to speak
 
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
courteously and all of those things and
 
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
it takes a while to learn especially if
 
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
you've not been in an elected body
 
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 align:start position:0%
before so we'll walk you through the
 
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
process it'll take a little while to get
 
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
used to
 
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
secondly there are several possible
 
00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 align:start position:0%
titles the one in the chair can adopt
 
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
for him or herself when I became
 
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
chairman of Health and Human Services
 
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
last term I asked the speaker if I could
 
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
be called illustrious potentate
 
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 align:start position:0%
that was rejected
 
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
I prefer the term Mr chairman not Mr
 
00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 align:start position:0%
chair but Mr chairman is a personal
 
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.469 align:start position:0%
chair but Mr chairman is a personal
title

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
title
 
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
however referring to the office and not
 
00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 align:start position:0%
the person we use the phrase the chair
 
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
as in the chair rules of the chair
 
00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
appoints so the office is the chair I
 
00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
prefer Mr chairman
 
00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.510 align:start position:0%
prefer Mr chairman
three

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
OLS office of legislative Services is
 
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
unusually slow this year in getting the
 
00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
bills drafted and sent to Community
 
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
Services where they are assigned to
 
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
committees and I'm trying very hard to
 
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 align:start position:0%
keep us going forward even if I don't
 
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
have too many bills that I can pick from
 
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
for next week's
 
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
committee meeting
 
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have a log Jam
 
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
if those bills are kind of delayed on
 
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
their end and delayed a bit on my end we
 
00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 align:start position:0%
may have to have two meetings a week
 
00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 align:start position:0%
before crossover and I don't want to do
 
00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
that and I know some of you don't
 
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
because some of you have part-time jobs
 
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
and have made arrangements for Tuesday
 
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
and Thursday
 
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.589 align:start position:0%
and Thursday
four

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
as a courtesy
 
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
several days ahead of our committee
 
00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 align:start position:0%
meetings where we will be having
 
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
hearings and even before the calendar
 
00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 align:start position:0%
comes out I try to contact the prime
 
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
sponsor of a bill
 
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
regarding what I'm going to schedule it
 
00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 align:start position:0%
I'll accommodate as much as I can
 
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
perhaps as an important witness who
 
00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 align:start position:0%
cannot make it on the 17th and if at all
 
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
possible I can defer that bill to the
 
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.309 align:start position:0%
possible I can defer that bill to the
24th

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
24th
 
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps the prime sponsor is going to be
 
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
prime sponsoring another bill in another
 
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
committee I can try to work around that
 
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
with the other committee chairman or
 
00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
chairwoman so if I call you or email you
 
00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
and leave you a message it's not only
 
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
courteous but it's in your best interest
 
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
to get back to me as soon as you can
 
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
because it may just well be about a bill
 
00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 align:start position:0%
that you're I'm sponsor of or that you
 
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
are a co-sponsor and have a great
 
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
investment in it
 
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
five when we hear a bill
 
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
if it looks like we're pretty much in
 
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
agreement I'll ask for a show of hands
 
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
or nodding or whatever
 
00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
that's not binding it's just a sense of
 
00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 align:start position:0%
the meeting but what it will say to me
 
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
is we are pretty much in agreement about
 
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
this bill in which case we can go to
 
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
exec it right away there's no need to
 
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
wait on it we're not going to change our
 
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
minds we're pretty much in agreement
 
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
this is helpful it's very much helpful
 
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
so that we can have some bills to get
 
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
out of the way early on before the Log
 
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
Jam occurs just before crossover
 
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
sometimes however we're not going to be
 
00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
in agreement
 
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
however we might come to agreement
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
in which case in my former committee I
 
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
would pick one or two Democrats and one
 
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
or two Republicans and ask them to get
 
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
together in person on zoom on a
 
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
conference call however they wish this
 
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
is not a 91a violation because it is
 
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
three or four or five people meeting
 
00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 align:start position:0%
informally it's not a work session
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
and that way if they come back and say
 
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
hey we think we have found some common
 
00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
ground now what I would be looking for
 
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
second best
 
00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 align:start position:0%
is a compromise
 
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
first best would be a comprehensiveness
 
00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
and many times in my former committee
 
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
what we did was we took the best of what
 
00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 align:start position:0%
might be called a Democrat position and
 
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
the best of what could be called a
 
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
republican position and found that we
 
00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
could come to Common Ground
 
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes it wasn't Democrat versus
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
Republicans sometimes it was some
 
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
Democrats and Republicans versus some
 
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
Democrats and Republicans but the people
 
00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 align:start position:0%
would come back with a suggestion saying
 
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
you know if we had this amendment
 
00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
I think we might have something worth
 
00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 align:start position:0%
keeping here
 
00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
now I will never ask people to violate
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
their consciences
 
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
but only about 10 or 15 percent of what
 
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
we do here is really core conscience
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
and some of the disagreements may be on
 
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
the best way to achieve something like
 
00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 align:start position:0%
the best way
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
to help the child that is our goal
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
there may be different ways to get there
 
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
and some of those ways May Clash but can
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
we find some common ground
 
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
in my last committee we often did and so
 
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
a lot of our builds came out 21-0 or 19
 
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
to 2. we didn't start off that way but
 
00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
we got there it's doable
 
00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:01.259 align:start position:0%
now six
 
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
when we have public hearings
 
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
please talk to the people you know who
 
00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
are going to come to the hearing and
 
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
testify please talk to them about what
 
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
our committee is and what our committee
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
isn't let me use an analogy
 
00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:22.259 align:start position:0%
last term I also chaired the DHHS
 
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
in response to newspaper reports that
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Board of Medicine was
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
not transparent in reporting 20
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
malpractice settlements against a
 
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
certain surgeon you've seen that in the
 
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
paper you've seen that on TV I named a
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
special subcommittee to investigate this
 
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
seeming lack of transparency
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of anger out there
 
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
believe it there was a lot of angry
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
people in anticipation of our
 
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meetings a few individuals
 
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
called me
 
00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
to see what punishment I would be
 
00:07:59.930 --> 00:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
meeting out
 
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:01.860 align:start position:0%
to that surgeon
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
and my answer was I will be meeting out
 
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
no punishment
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
that is the job of the eternity General
 
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
and there is an investigator working on
 
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
this very thing that is not the job of a
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
policy committee or subcommittee
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
also there were a few individuals who
 
00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
called me wanting to know how much
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
Financial relief we would be awarding
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
them because of the harm that happened
 
00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:33.419 align:start position:0%
to a loved one incurring extra medical
 
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
bills and I said that is not our job
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
either that's where you hire a
 
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
malpractice lawyer and so if people come
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
to a committee and they're all
 
00:08:48.769 --> 00:08:48.779 align:start position:0%
steamed up and expect our committee to
 
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
do certain things they need to know
 
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
there are certain things we do and some
 
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:56.220 align:start position:0%
things we don't do here let them know or
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
they will be disappointed or they'll be
 
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
angry at us
 
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
our task
 
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
referring out to my subcommittee again
 
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
was twofold review the laws and
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
procedures regarding how complaints
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
against Physicians and surgeons would be
 
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
received investigated and reported if we
 
00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
thought the laws needed to be revised we
 
00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
are a policy committee and we would
 
00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:27.899 align:start position:0%
eventually work to get those laws
 
00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:29.389 align:start position:0%
eventually work to get those laws
revised

00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
revised
 
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
if we concluded the laws were good but
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
they just weren't being followed
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
we can come up with a bill that maybe
 
00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:39.959 align:start position:0%
put some teeth into what happens to
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
people who don't do what they're
 
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
supposed to but meantime that gets
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
kicked over to the Attorney General's
 
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.329 align:start position:0%
kicked over to the Attorney General's
office

00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
I don't even have subpoena power much
 
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
and then the second thing that we did
 
00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
was to make sure that the board of
 
00:09:59.090 --> 00:09:59.100 align:start position:0%
medicines investigative unit had
 
00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
sufficient funding to do their job
 
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
that's why sometimes a bill you will see
 
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
has FN after its number fiscal note
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
we've got to spend some money to get
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
done what we want our policy to be
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
so please let your people know
 
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
that if they're really angry because
 
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
their sis the system is broken or the
 
00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:24.779 align:start position:0%
system has hurt them they may well be
 
00:10:24.779 --> 00:10:25.790 align:start position:0%
system has hurt them they may well be
right

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:34.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's not helpful
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
if somebody wants to testify
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
and it becomes a lengthy rant against
 
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
the system we could probably join them
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
in their rant we don't need to hear that
 
00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:50.459 align:start position:0%
but they need to be heard there may be
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
other places other venues where that may
 
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.569 --> 00:10:59.579 align:start position:0%
time allotment
 
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
my heart goes out to people who have
 
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
taken a day off of work
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
maybe losing a day's pay or incur child
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
care costs for them to cuss to come here
 
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
only to be frustrated
 
00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:19.019 align:start position:0%
in my first term in the house people
 
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
were allowed in our committee to testify
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
at length
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
and if you get 40 or 50 people signing
 
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
up to testify and the first five or ten
 
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
go on at length you can figure out what
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
happens I recall one hearing that
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
started at 1 pm
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
I look at my watch it's now 4 30. there
 
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
is still a stack of pink cards
 
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
some of the committee people have left
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
they have to go home
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
and so they didn't hear the testimony
 
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
others who wanted to testify and have
 
00:11:59.690 --> 00:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
taken a day off of work have hired Child
 
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
Care have to go home
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
and they have wasted a day and maybe
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
wasted a day's pay
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
so in my committee last term I adopted a
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
rule that some others have adopted
 
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor
 
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
of a Bill gets several minutes to
 
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
explain the bill a little bit longer if
 
00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:24.779 align:start position:0%
the bill is complicated
 
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
I give the same amount of time to one
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
person on the opposite side of the issue
 
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
and then depending on how many pink
 
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
cards I have I will set a time limit
 
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
that is the same for everybody on either
 
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.509 align:start position:0%
that is the same for everybody on either
side

00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:44.700 align:start position:0%
we adopted a rule saying if a time limit
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
is going to be the same
 
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
and if the chair wishes to change that
 
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
the chair needs to Simply note in the
 
00:12:56.449 --> 00:12:56.459 align:start position:0%
folder on the bill why you've heard my
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
blanket statement if we're going to have
 
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
a time limit it is after the first
 
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:04.220 align:start position:0%
person for in the first person against
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
has spoken
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
I think the best speech I heard last
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
year lasted 37 seconds
 
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
this person had written it out ahead and
 
00:13:20.569 --> 00:13:20.579 align:start position:0%
got rid of extraneous words bunny trails
 
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
and so on and got it down to three
 
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
points Each of which was Illustrated
 
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
with two very helpful sentences 37
 
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
what we also did
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
when we were giving people three minutes
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
is it two minutes 45 seconds we held up
 
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
a warning sign 2 45. and free an alarm
 
00:13:48.769 --> 00:13:48.779 align:start position:0%
went off if somebody had a phone with a
 
00:13:48.779 --> 00:13:50.030 align:start position:0%
went off if somebody had a phone with a
buzzer

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
buzzer
 
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
and invited the next person to come up
 
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
that may sound cruel
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
that is quite the opposite it makes sure
 
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
that people who have come to testify are
 
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
heard when there's a lot of people
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
it is the way to go
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
so sharing last term only once did my
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
committee have a meeting that went on
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
past 4 30 and that was when the Senate
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
sent us over a Christmas tree bill with
 
00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
87 parts
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
I have served notice that one's Dead on
 
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
Arrival if they pull that again
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
rarely did a Committee Member have to
 
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:36.260 align:start position:0%
leave and not hear people's testimony
 
00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
rarely that a pink card signer leave
 
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
without testifying
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
and I think we had a second day of
 
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
hearings only once so that's what I like
 
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
to do and I think it works
 
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.990 align:start position:0%
to do and I think it works
now

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
let's get into a heavy thing
 
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
some of you know in fact this morning
 
00:14:59.750 --> 00:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
earlier some of you even told me
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
this committee has not always been
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
looked upon with good regard
 
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
seven years ago
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
speaker Sean Jasper tried to abolish
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
few people I'm told
 
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
sign up to serve on it although a few of
 
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
you this is your first choice
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
or your first choice to come back but
 
00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:21.530 align:start position:0%
or your first choice to come back but
still

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
the reputation
 
00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
in the negative is not
 
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
because it's wrong to be passionate it
 
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
is good to be passionate about families
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
about children about a group in society
 
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
that believes it is being mistreated
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
it's not wrong to advocate for that it's
 
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.990 align:start position:0%
it's not wrong to advocate for that it's
right

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
the problem is sometimes people forget
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
that we can disagree without being
 
00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.210 align:start position:0%
that we can disagree without being
disagreeable

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
disagreeable
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
those of us because I'm one who have
 
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
been an advocate know that sometimes you
 
00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:02.459 align:start position:0%
can pound on somebody and wear them down
 
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
and I have done that that doesn't happen
 
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
in this committee
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
Advocate your position make your case
 
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
there will be people on the other side
 
00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:14.459 align:start position:0%
just as passionate May believe for good
 
00:16:14.459 --> 00:16:17.389 align:start position:0%
just as passionate May believe for good
reason

00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
even before I came into the legislature
 
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:22.740 align:start position:0%
I heard from people who told me they
 
00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:24.779 align:start position:0%
were running for the house because they
 
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
have been badly treated by the judicial
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
system and wanted to do something about
 
00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:30.110 align:start position:0%
system and wanted to do something about
it

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:16:32.329 --> 00:16:32.339 align:start position:0%
so far so good
 
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
some of them went on to say I'm going to
 
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
conquer to straighten them out and they
 
00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:40.139 align:start position:0%
came in with guns blazing you know that
 
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
almost never works
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
in fact sometimes it's actually
 
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.670 align:start position:0%
in fact sometimes it's actually
counterproductive

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
counterproductive
 
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
well last term we were quite passionate
 
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
about a number of the matters we
 
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
addressed in my health and human
 
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
services committee
 
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
but we always held each other in esteem
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
and treated each other with respect and
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
often we would in the beginning of the
 
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
term make sure
 
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
that a Democrat would invite a
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
republican to go out to lunch together
 
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:08.579 align:start position:0%
to get to know somebody in the committee
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
that is different
 
00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:12.419 align:start position:0%
my favorite story in representative
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
McMahon you may remember this was
 
00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
representative Jerry canerk a
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
progressive retired spine surgeon from
 
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.270 align:start position:0%
progressive retired spine surgeon from
freedom

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
freedom
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
put his hand up
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
the chair Lucy Weber called upon him and
 
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.070 align:start position:0%
the chair Lucy Weber called upon him and
he

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
he
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
argued from the right
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking who has crept into
 
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
Jerry's skull and changed him
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
well after he advocated the conservative
 
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
position I wasn't hearing much advocacy
 
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
for the opposite so I put my hand up and
 
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
I advocated for the left
 
00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.390 align:start position:0%
I advocated for the left
why

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
the position wasn't being articulated
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
and then we all had a good laugh if
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
you've ever been in Debate Club in
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
argue this point and you don't
 
00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
personally agree with it but that's not
 
00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
your job your job is to argue a
 
00:18:09.049 --> 00:18:09.059 align:start position:0%
different point and sometimes by trying
 
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
to at least in our own minds argue the
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
other side we may see that there's some
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
points in it that might just work that
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
might lead to that comprehensiveness it
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
just sort of happens spontaneously but
 
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
now I have already made one ruling here
 
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
by virtue of my chairmanship it has come
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
to my attention that representative
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
Levesque was not taken out by this
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
committee for a drink on her 21st
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
birthday and we are going to rectify
 
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
that I'll make you that promise we're
 
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
going to fix that
 
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
all right before we do the the sort of
 
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
meet and greet
 
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.470 align:start position:0%
meet and greet
um

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
now is the time if you have any
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
questions I saw representative Moulton
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
you had your hand up
 
00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:00.299 align:start position:0%
I did thank you Mr chair so Mr chairman
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just wondering if if a
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
Committee Member was to miss part of
 
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
could you mention this in your in your
 
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.930 align:start position:0%
could you mention this in your in your
speech

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
speech
 
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
um if someone was to miss part of a
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
committee meeting is it is it in YouTube
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
or something that we could watch it
 
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.169 align:start position:0%
or something that we could watch it
later

00:19:21.169 --> 00:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
like is it archived
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
I think so okay no that's good to know
 
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
I'm making every effort to be here for
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
every committee I actually got to work
 
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh shift switched so that I could be
 
00:19:36.169 --> 00:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
here today I remember that thank you for
 
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
doing that I wish I could have
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
accommodate did you but there's two
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
other committees that want this room
 
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
right yeah no I understand that so
 
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
um so of course like throughout the year
 
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna do everything I can to be here
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
but just I'm just wondering just in case
 
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
and representative Moulton thank you for
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
as a rookie
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
your first time with a hand up knowing
 
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
to push the microphone button on you
 
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
know I've met people who have been here
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
a long time and they still have trouble
 
00:20:06.169 --> 00:20:06.179 align:start position:0%
with that so thank you anybody else any
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
other responses to eye-opening Salvo
 
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:15.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.650 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:17.660 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
welcome back how long have you been away
 
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
um from this committee or from the
 
00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:25.820 align:start position:0%
legislature from the house yeah I left
 
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
2016. that's when I came in I started in
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
1996. wow welcome back thank you and I
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
started on this committee and spent 12
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
years on this committee wow and then I
 
00:20:39.529 --> 00:20:39.539 align:start position:0%
spent uh four years on uh
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government so I've
 
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
had a good vacation and working on town
 
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
government the last you look all fresh
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
and ready for action I am good
 
00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
um there was just one thing that you
 
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
said that I have to say I'm I'm so
 
00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
opposed to okay not somewhat but I am a
 
00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
post that's the straw poll idea on the
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
same day that someone presents a bill uh
 
00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
because I think it's rude
 
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
White Road to the sponsor and I think
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate to give them the
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come in with an amendment
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
rather than quickly just shuffling it
 
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.190 align:start position:0%
rather than quickly just shuffling it
out

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
if the sponsor of the bill
 
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
having seen the discussion is pretty
 
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
much in agreement with the sponsor's
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
bill still wishes to make an amendment
 
00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:30.860 align:start position:0%
and says that to me I will happily defer
 
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
it's I've never seen it done that way
 
00:21:36.409 --> 00:21:36.419 align:start position:0%
but it could be yeah we
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
well during some of my years here we put
 
00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
it away with the
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
idea of quickly dismissing things out of
 
00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
the out of politeness as much as
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
anything to the sponsors and gave them
 
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to come back with a
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
an amendment how would they want to come
 
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
back with an amendment with the sense of
 
00:21:57.169 --> 00:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
the meeting is in pretty much full
 
00:21:59.210 --> 00:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
agreement with what they gave us well we
 
00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
always waited till executive session
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
understood make those uh decisions on
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
even even on a straw poll
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
um well I would be happy to be reminded
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
if it looks like the committee pretty
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
much agrees with the bill as we heard it
 
00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
remind me please to ask the sponsor if
 
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
the sponsor is going to bring back an
 
00:22:24.649 --> 00:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
amendment or not
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
and if the sponsor says I would like to
 
00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
bring an amendment back
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
um through a member in the committee
 
00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:32.990 align:start position:0%

I've been uh in my 11th term now so it
 
00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
was 20 years on Health Human Services of
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
elderly Affairs prior to that I was a

long-term border selective member in
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
Windham and I have a attitude of being

an aggressive Advocate with manners so
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh it's uh also voted by saying let's
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
get it done while we're young so that
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
puts me in direct conflict with uh many
 
00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:39.059 align:start position:0%
people sometimes and you end up speaking
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
to an empty room but uh what I learned
 
00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
over time is to accept and respect the
 
00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
multiplicity of opinions and intentions
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
and there's also the public agenda and
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
then the hidden agenda and then doing
 
00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
and working together then we can
 
00:26:57.769 --> 00:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
accomplish something great for our state
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
and for our fellow citizens my
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
background is I'm married 40 years as
 
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
well I have three children one civilian
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
handicapped due to medical malpractice
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
and uh that's made me very sensitive to
 
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
the needs of those who have
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
quiet challenges that they keep private
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
in their homes but need assistance I
 
00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:18.179 align:start position:0%
brought that to my attitude here at the
 
00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
State House is listening first before
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
making pronouncements and
 
00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:24.419 align:start position:0%
recommendations for Action so what and
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
also working together as a team so
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
throughout the collaboration to achieve
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
consensus and getting it done while
 
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
we're young so I'm looking forward to
 
00:27:33.409 --> 00:27:33.419 align:start position:0%

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
the subject but you also bring a note of
 
00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
Realty don't you

I just have one unique thing is uh where
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
I learned a lot of this is an athletic
 
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
background that's where I learned a lot
 
00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
growing up uh setting goals and even
 
00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
getting knocked down a lot I was a
 
00:28:00.769 --> 00:28:00.779 align:start position:0%
football player and I got as high as a
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
trial with the Dallas Cowboys and and
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
then learning from those who are
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
successful at the highest levels and and
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
the real commitment to Excellence to
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
earn consideration at the highest levels

Representatives coming from our various
 
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
uh multiplicity of backgrounds and bring
 
00:28:21.169 --> 00:28:21.179 align:start position:0%
that benefit to us all to learn from
 
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
each other is it fair to say
 
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:24.900 align:start position:0%

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
lived in New York state for several
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
years and that's interviewing child
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
victims of sexual abuse and severe
 
00:29:21.289 --> 00:29:21.299 align:start position:0%
physical abuse then when we moved here I
 
00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
worked for dcif until 2016 and then I
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
worked for Casa as a program manager for
 
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
a while and then I um you can all see I
 
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
have a cane if I seem a little unsteady
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's because I had brain surgery this
 
00:29:37.549 --> 00:29:37.559 align:start position:0%
past year
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
um and so I stopped working and started
 
00:29:42.169 --> 00:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
volunteering I'm on the board of
 
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
education in Nashua I was the president
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
of the board throughout covid and I'm on
 
00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
the policy committee down there let's
 
00:29:51.889 --> 00:29:51.899 align:start position:0%
see what else I've been married for 19
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
years I have two kids we're right in
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
that fun Middle School teenage beginning
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
of high school years so it's a little
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
intense in my house
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
and Curiosities about myself other than
 
00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:09.059 align:start position:0%
my super cool cane and my still learning
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
to walk again
 
00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
I paint and I have been working really
 
00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
hard to redevelop that skill through
 
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy houses or floral
 
00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.130 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy houses or floral
arrangements

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
arrangements
 
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:25.140 align:start position:0%
um so I paint this is so silly I paint
 
00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:26.269 align:start position:0%
um so I paint this is so silly I paint
mostly

00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
mostly
 
00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
um animals Birds
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
um I do portraits of people as well um
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
but to make money mostly people like Pet
 
00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
Portraits I don't know why people would
 
00:30:36.769 --> 00:30:36.779 align:start position:0%
rather have me pet their paints than
 
00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
their kid their pets than their kids but
 
00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:40.940 align:start position:0%
I do a lot of dogs so
 
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
they don't sit still for the primer coat
 
00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.710 align:start position:0%
they don't sit still for the primer coat
sometimes

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:49.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
Nelson the only one I've seen who has a
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
first name on your name plate
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman that well we'll
 
00:31:03.049 --> 00:31:03.059 align:start position:0%
start with that Curiosity first there
 
00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
were two representative Nelsons when I
 
00:31:06.889 --> 00:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
came here I was the second
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
representative Bill retired yes and so I
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
believe that's why my first name was
 
00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
also included on there to not be
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
confused with him well there were two
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
named Pearson in the house right and I
 
00:31:21.649 --> 00:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
think it's because we tend to swipe each
 
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
other's name plates regularly they
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
decided not to but go ahead
 
00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh hello everyone my name
 
00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
is Jody Nelson I'm from Derry I have
 
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
lived in Derry since 2008 moving up here
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts with my husband of 22
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
years I have three children a stepson
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
who's 30 and my husband and I have two
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
children together our daughter's 21 and
 
00:31:50.169 --> 00:31:50.179 align:start position:0%
our son is 12. he was a
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
very uh big surprise because I wasn't uh
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
supposed to be able to have any more
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
children after my daughter so it's
 
00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
wonderful to be able to experience the
 
00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
last one and fully enjoy him
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
um I studied Elementary education at the
 
00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
University of Massachusetts but I chose
 
00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
to go into the corporate world most of
 
00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
my experience in the corporate world was
 
00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:19.340 align:start position:0%
in private Equity
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
a private Equity company in Boston where
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
I developed a very thick skin aunt which
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
is helpful here in this environment
 
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes so
 
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
um I uh
 
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
moved to the Northeast from Pennsylvania
 
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
when I was 11 and that's where my whole
 
00:32:47.049 --> 00:32:47.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
I guess that's it other than my other
 
00:33:00.649 --> 00:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.049 --> 00:33:03.059 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you
 
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:05.520 align:start position:0%

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you and yes you are apparently
 
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
from what I understand related yes I am
 
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
from that Greg family by marriage
 
00:33:15.889 --> 00:33:15.899 align:start position:0%
um so uh no bloodline there but my I'll
 
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
go ahead and start with that so my
 
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
husband's cousin is Judd Greg his great
 
00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:21.299 align:start position:0%
uncle was Hugh Greg
 
00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
um we are the last Greg's in Nashua and
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's where I currently live um that's
 
00:33:27.169 --> 00:33:27.179 align:start position:0%
not I wasn't lucky enough to be born in
 
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
um but I was born in the midwest in
 
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
Illinois way south of Chicago so I
 
00:33:36.169 --> 00:33:36.179 align:start position:0%
usually say St Louis because about a
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
half hour from St Louis and Southern
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
Illinois I'm proud to be from there um
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
even more proud to call this my home now
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
my husband was born and raised here
 
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
obviously with the Gregs
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
um but anyway my background is actually
 
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of you guys are at the
 
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
precipice of my what I call my new life
 
00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
so I am a survivor of domestic violence
 
00:33:57.409 --> 00:33:57.419 align:start position:0%
I have been out of that situation for
 
00:33:59.090 --> 00:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
six and a half years
 
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:01.140 align:start position:0%
um it was an extreme situation I came
 
00:34:03.769 --> 00:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
out of that and started advocacy to see
 
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
how many people I could help I have
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
helped women and men in three different
 
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
countries in over 30 States
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
um to get into safer places
 
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.730 align:start position:0%
um to get into safer places
um

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
which I have to look at a lot of
 
00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
legislation in different states
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
um when I do that and so like what you
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
know what are they Bound by in that
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
particular state so when the pandemic
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
hit I had time to research here that's
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
what led me to um run for office to see
 
00:34:30.649 --> 00:34:30.659 align:start position:0%
if we could move what I do in an
 
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
advocacy way to more of a legislative
 
00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:34.490 align:start position:0%
advocacy way to more of a legislative
level

00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
um I call myself a trifecta mom I have
 
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
three kids they are my Trifecta also
 
00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
amazing survivors and incredible humans
 
00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
I'm always happy to talk about them
 
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
um Noah Ethan and Emma
 
00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
uh the grand finale was the girl and I'm
 
00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
teaching her to drive so bear with me
 
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
um if you want to know judgment that's
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
what you should ride with somebody
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
that's in uh driver's ed
 
00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
um so that's so I was actually a
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
stay-at-home mom a very controlled
 
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
stay-at-home mom for um most of my life
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
and then six years ago I stepped out of
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
the shadows and said never again and so
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
I talked to groups about domestic
 
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
violence helped break the stigmas I have
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
a Blog that also does that
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
um you know and help individuals in that
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
aspect that won't change so I think they
 
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
call the official title a life coach
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
um and so uh yeah that's all kind of
 
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
curious right do I need two Curiosities
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
um I am my uh in my family line so
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
in my family line I have another
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
um uh kind of political thing my uh I
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
don't remember how many greats but Uncle
 
00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
whatever uh William Herndon helped get
 
00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:44.700 align:start position:0%
Abraham Lincoln elected he was his law
 
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
partner and that is my maiden name is
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%

um you know always had a healthy
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge and respect for the political
 
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
system because of that so

representative Greg and I should talk
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
but basically uh I've been in the court
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
system since March because the well
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
April since the marriage is dissolving
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
and I am well versed in
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of these laws
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily them directly but
 
00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:50.099 align:start position:0%
like what they mean and and who the
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
players are and things like that
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%

survive child abuse you can survive
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
anything I guess because the cancer is
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
no match
 
00:56:08.569 --> 00:56:08.579 align:start position:0%
um my sister unfortunately wasn't a
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%

00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
I prayed God to take her and I prayed
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
that I would do anything I could
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
possibly do to help children and
 
00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.270 align:start position:0%
possibly do to help children and
families

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:56:22.609 --> 00:56:22.619 align:start position:0%

01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of their Department of
 
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
Children and Families New Jersey set up
 
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
quite differently than New Hampshire
 
01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:22.460 align:start position:0%
where you have similar to Massachusetts
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
a separate department for child
 
01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:26.339 align:start position:0%
protection and children's Behavioral
 
01:04:28.609 --> 01:04:28.619 align:start position:0%
Health whereas here in New Hampshire you
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
have kind of an umbrella Health and
 
01:04:32.089 --> 01:04:32.099 align:start position:0%
Human Services Agency that does kind of
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
everything Health and Human Services
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
from Medicaid to Child Protection to
 
01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
TANF to
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
everything you can imagine and then you
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
have different divisions within that
 
01:04:42.289 --> 01:04:42.299 align:start position:0%
department that do all these separate
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
things dcyf is responsible specifically
 
01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
for child protection and Juvenile
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
Justice and we've done a lot in the last
 
01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
five years to try to change the way the
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
child welfare system in this state Works
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
a ton and I'm going to try to kind of
 
01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
walk folks through what a lot of that
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
has been we're certainly not going to
 
01:05:02.329 --> 01:05:02.339 align:start position:0%
get through all of it today and I am
 
01:05:04.490 --> 01:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
happy and eager to pause at any point
 
01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
that folks want to take questions of
 
01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
course at the discretion of the chair or
 
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
the vice chair whoever's presiding at
 
01:05:10.690 --> 01:05:10.700 align:start position:0%
the moment
 
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:18.049 --> 01:05:18.059 align:start position:0%
just want to share a little bit about
 
01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to accomplish here
 
01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
um so overall you know what our what our
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
vision is at dcyf is that we want to see
 
01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:27.059 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire's children youth and
 
01:05:29.089 --> 01:05:29.099 align:start position:0%
families are safe healthy and connected
 
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
right that's a much bigger Vision than
 
01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
what a Child Protection Agency can
 
01:05:34.490 --> 01:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
accomplish a much bigger Vision than
 
01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
what a juvenile justice agency can
 
01:05:37.609 --> 01:05:37.619 align:start position:0%
accomplish frankly it's a bigger Vision
 
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
than what the whole Department of Health
 
01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
and Human Services can accomplish it's a
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
vision that requires Collective action
 
01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
across the entirety of a state and when
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
we talk about connected the reason
 
01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
that's important is that we know that no
 
01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
child is successful without a family we
 
01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
know that no family is successful
 
01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
without a community folks need to be
 
01:05:57.049 --> 01:05:57.059 align:start position:0%
connected to other folks they don't work
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
well when they're in isolation
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
and when we think about the way that
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
child protection and even Juvenile
 
01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
Justice was structured here
 
01:06:08.329 --> 01:06:08.339 align:start position:0%
um in the Years prior there were a lot
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
of uh I think
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
structural misalignments in the way that
 
01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
we functioned
 
01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:15.650 align:start position:0%
we functioned
um

01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
probably the biggest primary challenge
 
01:06:21.289 --> 01:06:21.299 align:start position:0%
was that we were designed in a way to
 
01:06:24.529 --> 01:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
only be reactive to abuse and neglect
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
and to not actually try to do or even be
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
authorized to do anything to help
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
families before they got to that point
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
so literally our child protection agency
 
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
was not allowed to offer a service to a
 
01:06:38.930 --> 01:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
family until we completed an
 
01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
investigation substantiated abuse or
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
neglect brought them to court got a
 
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
court order for a service and frankly if
 
01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
you're doing all of that to get help for
 
01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
a family that there's no way that you're
 
01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:51.059 align:start position:0%
going to meet the needs of the people
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
that that you're serving right you need
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
to get to them a lot sooner than the
 
01:06:56.770 --> 01:06:56.780 align:start position:0%
point of dragging them into court
 
01:06:59.210 --> 01:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
and our Juvenile Justice System frankly
 
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
Works largely the same way and has
 
01:07:03.289 --> 01:07:03.299 align:start position:0%
worked largely the same way right that
 
01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
kids got the help that they needed once
 
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
they were found to have committed a
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
crime once they were arrested once they
 
01:07:10.849 --> 01:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
were brought into court found delinquent
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
and then they get ordered to get
 
01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Care treatment why
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
don't you just provide Behavioral Health
 
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
Care treatment at first right so a lot
 
01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
of the work for the past five years has
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
been around reorienting those systems
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
away from being reactive to crisis and
 
01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
using punitive interventions towards
 
01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
identifying needs and meeting needs
 
01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
that's a huge job and we're nowhere near
 
01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
done but that's kind of the the
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
orientation of the direction we've been
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
moving for the last five years so this
 
01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:37.859 align:start position:0%
first bucket here you know if we think
 
01:07:39.049 --> 01:07:39.059 align:start position:0%
of all the things we're doing they kind
 
01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
of fall in one of these two buckets to
 
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
the left the first one this idea earlier
 
01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
supports the strengthen children and
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
families and what we're talking about
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
there is that we want to shift child and
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
family serving systems to be more
 
01:07:50.809 --> 01:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
proactive and supportive and less
 
01:07:50.819 --> 01:07:52.309 align:start position:0%
proactive and supportive and less
coercive

01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
coercive
 
01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
I know folks find that work coercive
 
01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable sometimes my own staff
 
01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
find that word uncomfortable sometimes
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
but that's the truth right the child
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
protection agency has the ability to
 
01:08:03.049 --> 01:08:03.059 align:start position:0%
remove a child from a family that's a
 
01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
scary thing that's going to make
 
01:08:06.370 --> 01:08:06.380 align:start position:0%
families want to necessarily cooperate
 
01:08:08.329 --> 01:08:08.339 align:start position:0%
Juvenile justice system has the
 
01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
authority to impinge on the Liberty
 
01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
rights of young people that's a scary
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
thing that's going to make them not want
 
01:08:14.809 --> 01:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
to cooperate so if we're able to
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
identify their needs before we get to
 
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
that point of having to be kind of a
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
threatening presence then you're likely
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
to see better cooperation and better
 
01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
engagement from families and hopefully
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
better outcomes
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
um the second piece of this which is
 
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical as well is that I'm
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
not so naive as to believe that we're
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
going to be able to prevent every single
 
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
family and every single kid from having
 
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
to require a deep end intervention it's
 
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
true that there are people that abuse
 
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
kids and do awful things and those kids
 
01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
need to be protected sexual abuse occurs
 
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
physical abuse occurs those kids need to
 
01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:47.699 align:start position:0%
be protected fortunately that's not the
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
most of what we see but we do see it and
 
01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:51.179 align:start position:0%
when that happens we do need to be able
 
01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
to intervene and protect those kids same
 
01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
thing on the Juvenile Justice side we
 
01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
know that there are some offenses that
 
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
happen that are really severe that need
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
to the community needs to be protected
 
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
from I'm not so naive as to think that
 
01:09:03.289 --> 01:09:03.299 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to eliminate all
 
01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:04.739 align:start position:0%
of that with a snap of a finger and a
 
01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
couple nice services but we can minimize
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
how often we need to use those
 
01:09:10.249 --> 01:09:10.259 align:start position:0%
interventions by trying to help families
 
01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
and help kids sooner so when we do need
 
01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:14.759 align:start position:0%
to use the deep end of the system we
 
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we have the highest
 
01:09:17.809 --> 01:09:17.819 align:start position:0%
quality supports and services for kids
 
01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
and Families
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
and what this really is about a big part
 
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
of this has been around looking at what
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
our service system historically offered
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
and what it should offer
 
01:09:29.329 --> 01:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
historically our model for services for
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
kids and families in dcyf
 
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
um used kind of three different levels
 
01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
of services
 
01:09:37.249 --> 01:09:37.259 align:start position:0%
that we called child health support
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
which is kind of low level intervention
 
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
home-based therapy which is a medium
 
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
level intervention and what we called
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
intensive service option which was a
 
01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
high level intervention
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
there was no kind of specific modalities
 
01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
no evidence behind any of these programs
 
01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:53.699 align:start position:0%
nothing like that the rest of the
 
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
country had been studying different
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
modalities at work and have developed
 
01:09:59.450 --> 01:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
evidence behind programs but New
 
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hadn't adopted any of those so
 
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
a lot of our work for the past few years
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
has been moving away from kind of the
 
01:10:06.169 --> 01:10:06.179 align:start position:0%
historic model and moving into the
 
01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
utilization of evidence-based models
 
01:10:09.169 --> 01:10:09.179 align:start position:0%
that we know are effective at meeting
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
kids and families needs so as I'm
 
01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
talking further through this I'm going
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
to be kind of talking about these two
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
big Ideas this idea of Shifting the
 
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
system more Upstream to identify and
 
01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
support families sooner and the idea of
 
01:10:21.169 --> 01:10:21.179 align:start position:0%
that when families do need deep end
 
01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
intervention the types of things that we
 
01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
do to help them have their needs met and
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
keep kids from coming back into the
 
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
system again
 
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
any thoughts on these big picture ideas
 
01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.659 --> 01:10:37.790 align:start position:0%
 
great

01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
so the first thing I'm going to talk
 
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
about is actually not even in dcyf and I
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
think I understand the chair has had the
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh the the brilliant foresight to invite
 
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health to come
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
present so I'm not going to go deep on
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
this but the first big thing in
 
01:10:54.169 --> 01:10:54.179 align:start position:0%
reforming child protection actually has
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with child protection and
 
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice it has to do with
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
actually building a children's
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Care System Something
 
01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire didn't have five years ago
 
01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh put your hand up and I'll recognize
 
01:11:08.209 --> 01:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
you yes representative Bickford welcome
 
01:11:08.219 --> 01:11:10.370 align:start position:0%
you yes representative Bickford welcome
back

01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:11:15.169 --> 01:11:15.179 align:start position:0%
hey man thank you very much Mr chairman
 
01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
um don't forget that
 
01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
um he's just going a little fast for me
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's all uh if he could speak just a
 
01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
little slower absolutely I get this
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
the air conditioner yeah the New Jersey
 
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
mouth New Hampshire ears
 
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's right thank you okay over now so
 
01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
um so yeah actually New Hampshire did
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
not have a children's Behavioral Health
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
Care system five years ago in fact if
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
you looked at the 10-year mental health
 
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
plan that was developed I guess 12 or so
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
years ago at this point the word child
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
was never used one time as if children
 
01:11:51.169 --> 01:11:51.179 align:start position:0%
don't have Behavioral Health Care needs
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
um which is just baffling to me right
 
01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
and if you look at you know what we did
 
01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
in New Jersey what a lot of other states
 
01:11:58.850 --> 01:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
have been doing is if you start to
 
01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
identify and meet the Behavioral Health
 
01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:02.820 align:start position:0%
Care needs of kids you can drive down
 
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
the needs in your juvenile justice
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
system and the needs in your child
 
01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
protection system because so many of the
 
01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
kids that show up there are just kids
 
01:12:11.689 --> 01:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
that aren't having their needs met
 
01:12:11.699 --> 01:12:12.830 align:start position:0%
that aren't having their needs met
elsewhere

01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
so some of the biggest things that we
 
01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
had to do in New Hampshire to fix Child
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
Protection Juvenile Justice was actually
 
01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
building a children's Behavioral Health
 
01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
Care system and I understand Rebecca
 
01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:23.460 align:start position:0%
Ross from children's behavioral health
 
01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
will be coming at a future meeting so
 
01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
she'll go deeper on all that stuff I'm
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
not going to go super deep on that but
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
there's just a couple key points I want
 
01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
to make big deal things that have been
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
done in the past couple years here right
 
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
rapid response that mobile crisis
 
01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
services that launched last year that's
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
a huge huge deal for kids and families
 
01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
and keeping kids stable in their home
 
01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.030 align:start position:0%
and keeping kids stable in their home
communities

01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
that we're actually using an assessment
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
nowadays to identify what Behavioral
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
Health kids what what needs are for kids
 
01:12:51.649 --> 01:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
in Behavioral Health historically when
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
kids came to dcyf for child protection
 
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
and Juvenile Justice
 
01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
if we were trying to determine where a
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
kid should be placed what type of
 
01:12:59.810 --> 01:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
program they should be in there wasn't
 
01:13:01.490 --> 01:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
actually clinical assessment done as a
 
01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
kid of a kid they were just kind of
 
01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
matching up kind of professional
 
01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
Judgment of what they thought a kid
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
needed with what was out available in
 
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
the community a couple years ago we
 
01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
started a new process called the cap
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
process so now all kids get a
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
standardized assessment
 
01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
and all the all the new residential
 
01:13:20.209 --> 01:13:20.219 align:start position:0%
programs again Rebecca will go deeper on
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
this but they all have contracts that
 
01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
have specific evidence-based modalities
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
that go along with the types of
 
01:13:29.090 --> 01:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
um the types of services that they
 
01:13:30.649 --> 01:13:30.659 align:start position:0%
require based on what those assessments
 
01:13:32.330 --> 01:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
have so that whole system's been
 
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
revamped yes chair uh wishes to ask
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I've seen the pendulum shift in other
 
01:13:41.689 --> 01:13:41.699 align:start position:0%
areas of life from the professional who
 
01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
eyeballs it to the opposite of this is
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
what the test says I'm hoping that the
 
01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:51.780 align:start position:0%
appropriate adoption of evidence-based
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
things is not at the total expense of
 
01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
the person who's done this for years and
 
01:13:58.970 --> 01:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
can have a gut instinct oh yeah no it's
 
01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
it is a process and actually if you look
 
01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
at the way those the cat assessments are
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
in they're written with you know this is
 
01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
kind of the range of recommendations and
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
especially when you're talking about
 
01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
placement of a child in a residential
 
01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
setting a lot of it is there's a little
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
bit of wiggle room in terms of whether
 
01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
you can provide that clinical care in a
 
01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
home setting with intensive Clinical
 
01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:18.300 align:start position:0%
Services or in a residential setting
 
01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:20.340 align:start position:0%
based on you know what the home
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
environment is as well so you know the I
 
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to get too deep but there's
 
01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
five levels of care that are identified
 
01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
in the cat assessment and really among
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
the first three levels if you have a
 
01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
stable home setting you can really
 
01:14:34.610 --> 01:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
provide that level of clinical service
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
within the home if you have a stable
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
home setting in the right clinician in
 
01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
place so give some discretion within
 
01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
there as well as you know what's the
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
what's the right way to make sure the
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
clinical needs are being met even in
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
terms of whether you're going to use a
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
program or whether you're going to use a
 
01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:50.630 align:start position:0%
program or whether you're going to use a
home

01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
couple other big just key things
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
um the key service that's used for high
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
and moderate Behavioral Healthcare needs
 
01:15:00.169 --> 01:15:00.179 align:start position:0%
is something called High Fidelity
 
01:15:02.689 --> 01:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
wraparound Services there's a program in
 
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire called Fast Forward which
 
01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
uses this model
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
that is I'm sorry we're on page four now
 
01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
see people
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
jumping around that's a program called
 
01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
Fast Forward
 
01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
the model of High Fidelity wraparound
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
Services what they do is they have a
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
clinical person who leads the team and
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
they pull together the young person they
 
01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
should always be at the table the family
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
they should always be at the table
 
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
whatever professionals are working with
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
them so if Child Protection or Juvenile
 
01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
Justice is involved they're going to be
 
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
at the table but it's also entirely
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
possible that Juvenile Justice and Child
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
Protection are not involved
 
01:15:39.770 --> 01:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
schools they should be at the table any
 
01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
clinicians treating the family and any
 
01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
natural supports so anybody the family
 
01:15:45.649 --> 01:15:45.659 align:start position:0%
relies on that could be grandparents
 
01:15:47.689 --> 01:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
Aunts Uncles neighbors faith community
 
01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
members whomever it is that family
 
01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
identifies as important and the goal is
 
01:15:53.689 --> 01:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
that you have that team of people try to
 
01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
figure out how do you support this kid
 
01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
and how do you support this family to
 
01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
keep this kid in their Community
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
receiving the support that they need and
 
01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
how do you keep this family getting the
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
support that they need and using a
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
service like that for many many families
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
is enough to keep a kid out of like a
 
01:16:11.209 --> 01:16:11.219 align:start position:0%
residential stay and something like that
 
01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:13.140 align:start position:0%
and then there's a separate variation on
 
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
this that we created called Trek here
 
01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:15.900 align:start position:0%
and I'm not remembering what the acronym
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
stands for right now but essentially
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
what Trek is is it's that same exact
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
service but it's for when a kid is in
 
01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
residential placement
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
and what they do is they work with that
 
01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
same team of people to help put together
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
a team to make sure that when the kid
 
01:16:30.290 --> 01:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
comes home for residential they stay
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
home from residential that they're able
 
01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:33.900 align:start position:0%
to go back to their community and be
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
safe and supported and not end up going
 
01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
back into the system over and over again
 
01:16:39.169 --> 01:16:39.179 align:start position:0%
the way that we've historically seen
 
01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
those are massive changes to the system
 
01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:42.900 align:start position:0%
that have occurred over the past few
 
01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:43.910 align:start position:0%
that have occurred over the past few
years

01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
you know fast forward was a program that
 
01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
five years ago didn't serve anybody and
 
01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
now is serving close to 500 kids at a
 
01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
time and Trek serving currently I think
 
01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
120 kids at a time overall rate the need
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
for these services are probably greater
 
01:16:59.149 --> 01:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
than we currently have capacity for but
 
01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
but you know a lot of a lot of really
 
01:17:02.689 --> 01:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
great work is happening there and a lot
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
of kids who otherwise would have been in
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
the Juvenile Justice System I think are
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
showing up over in this system instead
 
01:17:09.169 --> 01:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
which is exactly what we're talking
 
01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
about getting kids and families into a
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
place where their needs are met in a
 
01:17:15.890 --> 01:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
non-coresive supportive way where kids
 
01:17:17.209 --> 01:17:17.219 align:start position:0%
and families are in the driver's seat
 
01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
with clinicians instead of having courts
 
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
and state employees and other people
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
driving their lives
 
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
um I'll skip over the rest of this page
 
01:17:34.189 --> 01:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
so last year we started what I think is
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
one of the most exciting projects
 
01:17:42.649 --> 01:17:42.659 align:start position:0%
um that I've been part of in my career
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
that I think is going to end up proving
 
01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
the next few years to be the model for
 
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
the country in terms of trying to kind
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
of redirect how Juvenile Justice works
 
01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
there was a bill that was passed called
 
01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
it was Senate Bill 94 sponsored by
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson passed I think
 
01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
unanimously you know certainly in this
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
chamber a couple years ago in this
 
01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
committee a couple years ago when it
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
came through I think it might have
 
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
actually been unanimously on the floor
 
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:18:11.209 --> 01:18:11.219 align:start position:0%
and what Senate Bill 94 did was it
 
01:18:13.729 --> 01:18:13.739 align:start position:0%
created a new process whereby when kids
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
have contact with law enforcement
 
01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
law enforcement offers that child an
 
01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be referred to us to do
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
an assessment
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
and the prosecution of that case gets
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
paused for 30 days while we do the
 
01:18:31.490 --> 01:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
assessment there's an exception in there
 
01:18:34.189 --> 01:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
if it's a if it's a critical high-risk
 
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
situation right if this is a a serious
 
01:18:38.209 --> 01:18:38.219 align:start position:0%
violent crime for which law enforcement
 
01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
feels that they need to remove the child
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
and detain them immediately to keep the
 
01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
community safe there's an exception for
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
that but otherwise and that's rare right
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
there's there's thousands of arrests
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
every year
 
01:18:51.169 --> 01:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
only a handful are like those types of
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
serious violent crimes so serious
 
01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
violent crimes there's an exception but
 
01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
for everything else it goes through this
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
process where the family's given an
 
01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have an assessment done
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
and we use What's called the cans
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
assessment child adolescent needs and
 
01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.770 align:start position:0%
assessment child adolescent needs and
strengths

01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
strengths
 
01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
the reason we chose the cans is that one
 
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
it inventories all different types of
 
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
needs and domains of kids to help you
 
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
identify what's going on two it's also
 
01:19:14.810 --> 01:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
the same exact tool that's already used
 
01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
in the children's Behavioral Health Care
 
01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
system and we wanted to use the same
 
01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:20.219 align:start position:0%
tool across multiple systems so that
 
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
people can communicate with each other
 
01:19:24.169 --> 01:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
understand kids needs and be able to do
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
planning for kids additionally because
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see kids and families pop up in
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
different systems at different times and
 
01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
if you're using a common assessment that
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
makes planning better and easier over
 
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:36.300 align:start position:0%
time so what we do is we use this cans
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
tool and then we from that develop our
 
01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
recommendations is this a child who
 
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
needs to go to court because we think
 
01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
that this is a situation that's so
 
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
serious and a family and a child that's
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
not willing to engage in an alternative
 
01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
you know solution to this problem or is
 
01:19:53.810 --> 01:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
this child and family who were able to
 
01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
provide services for in the community
 
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
can we get them involved in that fast
 
01:19:58.010 --> 01:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
forward program I was just talking about
 
01:19:59.630 --> 01:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
can we get them involved in Outpatient
 
01:20:01.729 --> 01:20:01.739 align:start position:0%
Therapy can we get them involved in a
 
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
local diversion program can we get them
 
01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
involved in a Boys and Girls Club can we
 
01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
get them involved in some of these kids
 
01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
just need some type of pro-social
 
01:20:09.709 --> 01:20:09.719 align:start position:0%
activity like a little league or
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
something to keep them busy and occupied
 
01:20:13.970 --> 01:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
in something productive and healthy
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
so this started here in New Hampshire in
 
01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:18.540 align:start position:0%
January and one third of the state last
 
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
January we rolled out to the next third
 
01:20:22.930 --> 01:20:22.940 align:start position:0%
of the state in
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
July and we finished rolling out
 
01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:26.750 align:start position:0%
July and we finished rolling out
Statewide

01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
01:20:31.370 --> 01:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
in October so early data from this is
 
01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
really really promising
 
01:20:35.689 --> 01:20:35.699 align:start position:0%
that's what you'll see on Page Six
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
so you'll see the numbers here a little
 
01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
bit skewed based on the rollout schedule
 
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
but we are now Statewide and to date
 
01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
we've done a little over a thousand
 
01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
assessments across the across the state
 
01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
Manchester was in the last group which
 
01:20:50.290 --> 01:20:50.300 align:start position:0%
is obviously our biggest
 
01:20:53.630 --> 01:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
District so I do anticipate the annual
 
01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
volume will probably be you know closer
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
to maybe
 
01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
1600 to 2000 assessments a year when we
 
01:21:02.510 --> 01:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
see it
 
01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
what you see on the right is was the
 
01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
service was the referral accepted by the
 
01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
family so when law enforcement makes
 
01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
this referral the families it's TR it's
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
entirely voluntary a family can say no I
 
01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to do this and the law
 
01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
enforcement has a prerogative to go
 
01:21:20.810 --> 01:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
forward and prosecute the old way or
 
01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
they can participate and we're seeing 72
 
01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
percent of the families being willing to
 
01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:27.659 align:start position:0%
engage in that service up front which I
 
01:21:29.290 --> 01:21:29.300 align:start position:0%
think is a pretty a pretty good
 
01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
engagement percentage for a brand new
 
01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:33.719 align:start position:0%
service like this could you break out
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
the non-accepted category in terms of
 
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
the family did not accept what was
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
offered but law enforcement said but
 
01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
you're going to versus law enforcement
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
says okay you don't have to so yeah and
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
the next page you have something that
 
01:21:50.689 --> 01:21:50.699 align:start position:0%
kind of sort of gets to that so I'll
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
touch that on the next page ah
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
so on the next page
 
01:21:58.610 --> 01:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
what we see is
 
01:22:00.169 --> 01:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
um on the left a pie chart of the
 
01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
recommended interventions so of the
 
01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
assessments that we complete
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
28 of the time we recommended Court
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
involvement typically what's happening
 
01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
there is that the offense was you know
 
01:22:12.169 --> 01:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
fairly serious that you have a family
 
01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:13.739 align:start position:0%
and or a youth who's not willing to
 
01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
engage voluntarily in services and you
 
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
know we're really saying you need to
 
01:22:19.490 --> 01:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
have a court involved in this to make
 
01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:21.179 align:start position:0%
sure that this family and this youth are
 
01:22:23.090 --> 01:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
engaged in the process but I think
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
what's really exciting is 72 percent of
 
01:22:27.050 --> 01:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
the time we're identifying that these
 
01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
are kids and families that could have
 
01:22:30.290 --> 01:22:30.300 align:start position:0%
their needs met in the community through
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
a service without having to go to court
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
um and of those 11 going to local
 
01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
diversion programs so I don't know how
 
01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
familiar folks are here with the version
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
I know uh representative DeSimone can
 
01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:44.219 align:start position:0%
tell us all about it at some point
 
01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
um but those are those are programs that
 
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
um work with kids around restorative
 
01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
justice models to help them
 
01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
um understand kind of the harm that they
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
caused work with victims to try to to
 
01:22:58.250 --> 01:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
heal the harm that they caused and get
 
01:22:59.810 --> 01:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
them engaged in some type of pro-social
 
01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:01.130 align:start position:0%
them engaged in some type of pro-social
work

01:23:01.130 --> 01:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
um about 13 are being recommended for
 
01:23:05.149 --> 01:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
higher level Behavioral Health Care like
 
01:23:07.010 --> 01:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
Fast Forward which is you know not
 
01:23:08.570 --> 01:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
surprising to me but that you know is
 
01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
indicative that there's a lot of kids
 
01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
who show up in the juvenile justice
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
system that have unmet Behavioral Health
 
01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
needs and another 14 that are showing up
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
with a need for some type of outpatient
 
01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
therapeutic care so not like uh not a
 
01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
high level fast forward intervention but
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
just like Outpatient Therapy
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
um those are probably that's probably
 
01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest gaps we're seeing in
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
the system though in terms of getting
 
01:23:31.729 --> 01:23:31.739 align:start position:0%
access so we're having kids who are
 
01:23:33.649 --> 01:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
identifying with that level of need but
 
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
having the hardest time getting kids
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
enrolled in outpatient therapy because
 
01:23:38.689 --> 01:23:38.699 align:start position:0%
of just access issues with clinicians
 
01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
the next chart I think gets to kind of
 
01:23:42.169 --> 01:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
sort of what the chair was asking about
 
01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
which is once we make our
 
01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:45.729 align:start position:0%
which is once we make our
recommendations

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:45.739 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:23:47.930 --> 01:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
law enforcement actually does not have
 
01:23:49.370 --> 01:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
to agree with us they can file
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
regardless of what we recommend right
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
that's the way the law was written that
 
01:23:55.490 --> 01:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
they have their own discretion but 94 of
 
01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
the time they're agreeing with us
 
01:23:58.370 --> 01:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
they're they're following the path that
 
01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
we set forward and early data is that
 
01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:02.699 align:start position:0%
you know the outcomes are pretty good
 
01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
here you know of all the kids that are
 
01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
going through this process it's a
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
relative handful that are coming back
 
01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
for a second time within the first you
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
know six months or so of going through
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
this process so we're really excited
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
about what we're seeing that being said
 
01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
it's all still very early right we don't
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
even have a full year behind us
 
01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
and I'll pause on that in case there's
 
01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:23.330 align:start position:0%
and I'll pause on that in case there's
anything

01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I do have a
 
01:24:32.930 --> 01:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
in the real world right
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
but any of these programs or any of this
 
01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
taken in consideration uh people
 
01:24:44.930 --> 01:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
background religion language because a
 
01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
lot of people we come in from different
 
01:24:49.090 --> 01:24:49.100 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and a lot a lot of times
 
01:24:52.930 --> 01:24:52.940 align:start position:0%
when we talk about children and
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
younger Generations
 
01:24:58.610 --> 01:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to them to feel
 
01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
comfortable to speak with someone
 
01:25:05.209 --> 01:25:05.219 align:start position:0%
especially with different religious
 
01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
background or language
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
do you guys have
 
01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
a training uh people in the department
 
01:25:17.689 --> 01:25:17.699 align:start position:0%
they they know how to handle situations
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
where a young or children feel unsafe to
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
be speaking because you know
 
01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
the backgrounds and and beliefs yeah
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
yeah so two parts that I think yes there
 
01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
are there are services and trainings for
 
01:25:34.250 --> 01:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
all of that but I also think that a lot
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
more that can be done right so there are
 
01:25:39.169 --> 01:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
trainings around you know Dei trainings
 
01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
trainings around and actually the Kansas
 
01:25:43.149 --> 01:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
assessment actually has specific
 
01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
sections around understanding religious
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
cultural differences and things like
 
01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:48.770 align:start position:0%
cultural differences and things like
that

01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:49.850 --> 01:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
um and we have what's called a language
 
01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
Bank you know but the truth is you know
 
01:25:54.169 --> 01:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
that engaging with families often is
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
really really hard when you have a third
 
01:25:58.129 --> 01:25:58.139 align:start position:0%
party in the middle of it right and it's
 
01:25:59.450 --> 01:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
it's much better if you actually have
 
01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
somebody who's actually shares the same
 
01:26:03.770 --> 01:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
culture and history and traditions as
 
01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
the folks you're working with and that's
 
01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
an area where I think we probably still
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:12.719 --> 01:26:14.209 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:26:14.209 --> 01:26:14.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
very quickly uh is my background
 
01:26:19.370 --> 01:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
um sometimes it's difficult for big
 
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
things especially like a child a young
 
01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:24.310 align:start position:0%
things especially like a child a young
person

01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
to speak up because uh
 
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
immigration studies sometimes temporary
 
01:26:33.010 --> 01:26:33.020 align:start position:0%
immigration status
 
01:26:36.850 --> 01:26:36.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
protect the studies of the victims
 
01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
because a lot of times and victims they
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
are afraid to speak up because uh legal
 
01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:48.780 align:start position:0%
status right yeah I mean I think the
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
with children in particular they're
 
01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
stronger there are pretty strong Federal
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
Protections in terms of them being able
 
01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
to actually gain legal status through
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not remembering the the acronym
 
01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
right now but there are two different
 
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
pathways through which if a young person
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
is a victim of child abuse or neglect
 
01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
that they can actually gain legal status
 
01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
through our through our system and
 
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
through our processes so for children
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
those prime those protections do exist I
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
think at the same time that doesn't mean
 
01:27:23.209 --> 01:27:23.219 align:start position:0%
that they actually understand right a
 
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
child who's a victim in the community
 
01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't understand that those
 
01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
protections exist and probably doesn't
 
01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
understand that those those fears can be
 
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
can be alleviated and met right so I
 
01:27:34.729 --> 01:27:34.739 align:start position:0%
think there's definitely work to be done
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of helping people understand
 
01:27:39.709 --> 01:27:39.719 align:start position:0%
that we actually can can help navigate
 
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
those things for them thank you yeah
 
01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
stipulating that having
 
01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:48.470 align:start position:0%
stipulating that having
someone

01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
someone
 
01:27:53.050 --> 01:27:53.060 align:start position:0%
who shares religious ethnic linguistic
 
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
background is a good thing
 
01:27:57.890 --> 01:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
can you speak to the level of
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
intentionality in recruiting and hiring
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean honestly in child protection
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
right now the workforce issues are such
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
that it's you know we need we need
 
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
everybody that we can get
 
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
so um you know we're we're hiring as
 
01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
rapidly and quickly as we can and we
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
intentionally recruit for all types of
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
groups of folks and everywhere that we
 
01:28:23.149 --> 01:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
possibly can but we're short of Staff
 
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
right so it's it's you know it's you
 
01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
can't be too we can't be too selective
 
01:28:30.410 --> 01:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
in a moment that we're you know just
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
trying to maintain enough staff to to
 
01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
manage reasonable caseloads the medical
 
01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:38.820 align:start position:0%
center I'm part-time CEO of shares this
 
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
problem too yeah did I see a hand uh
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
I know I'm getting there representative
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
Raymond thanks it's a lot it's a lot of
 
01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
names to start out with the first day um
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr ribsom and and thank you
 
01:28:53.209 --> 01:28:53.219 align:start position:0%
chairman for calling on me
 
01:28:56.450 --> 01:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
um on the the topic of Staffing
 
01:28:59.689 --> 01:28:59.699 align:start position:0%
um I know from watching the news and
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
um just having my fingers in a lot of
 
01:29:04.010 --> 01:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
areas in the community that
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
um it's still very challenging for
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
people to access mental health treatment
 
01:29:12.649 --> 01:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
for children is there
 
01:29:15.470 --> 01:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
um an advantage that families get from
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
being involved with your agency now is
 
01:29:20.209 --> 01:29:20.219 align:start position:0%
there a way like are you able to cut
 
01:29:22.729 --> 01:29:22.739 align:start position:0%
some of the times I know we have kids
 
01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
sitting in ERS for weeks to months we
 
01:29:27.770 --> 01:29:27.780 align:start position:0%
have you know I think the last time I
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
was looking to help someone get into
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
mental health counseling for a teenager
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
that wasn't suicidal it was like a four
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
month wait
 
01:29:37.610 --> 01:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
um are you seeing the same thing we are
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we're seeing the same thing I
 
01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
mean so the the system of care for for
 
01:29:44.330 --> 01:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
mental health it's the we access child
 
01:29:45.890 --> 01:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
protection and Juvenile Justice access
 
01:29:47.689 --> 01:29:47.699 align:start position:0%
the same exact system that the public at
 
01:29:49.490 --> 01:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
large accesses we don't have a separate
 
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
special system or separate special
 
01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
access right so
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
kids involved in our system are also
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
um you know also have the same
 
01:29:59.870 --> 01:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
challenges in terms of getting getting
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
access and wait lists
 
01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:03.590 align:start position:0%
access and wait lists
um

01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
you know we've seen I think a lot of you
 
01:30:07.729 --> 01:30:07.739 align:start position:0%
know improvement over the past few years
 
01:30:09.709 --> 01:30:09.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of having some of these things
 
01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
available right having fast forward
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
available for the first time I Can Only
 
01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:14.530 align:start position:0%
available for the first time I Can Only
Imagine

01:30:14.530 --> 01:30:14.540 align:start position:0%
Imagine
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
how awful things would be today if we
 
01:30:18.770 --> 01:30:18.780 align:start position:0%
didn't have that available you know
 
01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
having rapid response available I can
 
01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
only imagine how awful it would be if we
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have that available that being
 
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
said I think you know what we've seen
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
over the past you know in the post
 
01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
coveted period was the identification of
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
mental health needs just Skyrocket
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that's something
 
01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:34.739 align:start position:0%
that when when
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
um Rebecca Ross from children's
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
behavioral health comes she can go more
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
into that but I've seen some data that
 
01:30:40.129 --> 01:30:40.139 align:start position:0%
she's presented which has just been you
 
01:30:42.649 --> 01:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
know jaw dropping in terms of folks
 
01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
identifying mental health needs and
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health needs of their
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
children you know going from you know
 
01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
very low levels to you know 90 of
 
01:30:51.410 --> 01:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
adolescents identifying as having some
 
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
type of mental health need
 
01:30:55.729 --> 01:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
um so the I think the the dynamic has
 
01:30:57.530 --> 01:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
shifted in a way that is
 
01:31:03.290 --> 01:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:06.110 --> 01:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative Grossman
 
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
got it thank you Mr chairman
 
01:31:11.629 --> 01:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
um have you also noticed
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
the pandemic affecting the mental health
 
01:31:19.129 --> 01:31:19.139 align:start position:0%
needs of our children I mean I know just
 
01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
in my area and being a mom of three
 
01:31:23.810 --> 01:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
teenagers I've seen how it directly
 
01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
affected them
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sure I mean I you know it's
 
01:31:30.050 --> 01:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
hard for me to point to exactly what the
 
01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
driver of all of this is but certainly
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
the timing is such that you know we saw
 
01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
coming out of that pandemic and out of
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
isolation and everything else the the
 
01:31:39.890 --> 01:31:39.900 align:start position:0%
mental health needs of young people just
 
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely Skyrocket and but you know
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
when we talked about children in
 
01:31:45.169 --> 01:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
emergency departments I think one of the
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
things that was fascinating to the
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
department is that historically the kids
 
01:31:49.550 --> 01:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
who would show up into the emergency
 
01:31:51.050 --> 01:31:51.060 align:start position:0%
departments were already known to the
 
01:31:53.149 --> 01:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
system and the kids that were showing up
 
01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
in emergency departments post-pandemic
 
01:31:56.570 --> 01:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
were kids that were not known to the
 
01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
system so you had a lot of kind of new
 
01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
entries into the system of you know
 
01:32:03.770 --> 01:32:03.780 align:start position:0%
intensive mental health needs in a way
 
01:32:05.450 --> 01:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
that you know nobody had experienced
 
01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
before so you know I'm not somebody who
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
can figure out exactly what the driver
 
01:32:15.169 --> 01:32:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:15.179 --> 01:32:18.790 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
pretty much blunt I grew up with a
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
family from New York and Massachusetts
 
01:32:32.810 --> 01:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
so I can keep up with you um
 
01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
is there anything that like we can do to
 
01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
help you when it comes to like the
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
mental health especially when it comes
 
01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
to youth we're seeing a lot of Youth
 
01:32:42.770 --> 01:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
especially My Generation generation
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
after me with anxiety depression and
 
01:32:48.890 --> 01:32:48.900 align:start position:0%
they're entering into the workforce and
 
01:32:52.570 --> 01:32:52.580 align:start position:0%
into the world with all these things and
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
especially when they're in that in the
 
01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:56.290 align:start position:0%
especially when they're in that in the
system

01:32:56.290 --> 01:32:56.300 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:32:59.570 --> 01:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
and they're being like passed over for
 
01:33:02.209 --> 01:33:02.219 align:start position:0%
someone that's suicidal or whatever and
 
01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
just because they haven't talked to
 
01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
someone about how they feel because they
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
don't know how to because they come from
 
01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
families where it's just like oh a
 
01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
therapist you can't talk to a therapist
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
because therapists are quacks you know
 
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
and all that stigma and
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
um is there anything that we can well
 
01:33:24.110 --> 01:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
and I think I think if we go if you just
 
01:33:26.450 --> 01:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
go back to that one page right and and
 
01:33:29.810 --> 01:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
we'll see 13 14 of the kids that are
 
01:33:31.370 --> 01:33:31.380 align:start position:0%
getting assessed through this Juvenile
 
01:33:33.530 --> 01:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
Justice assessment process are showing
 
01:33:36.530 --> 01:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
up as requiring some type of Outpatient
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
Treatment and as I said that's actually
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
the thing of everything on that wheel
 
01:33:41.570 --> 01:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
that we're having the hardest time
 
01:33:44.810 --> 01:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
accessing is outpatient care I think you
 
01:33:46.129 --> 01:33:46.139 align:start position:0%
know that is a place where we need to
 
01:33:47.810 --> 01:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
put a lot of attention on how do we how
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
do we prop that up and expand that and
 
01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
support access to outpatient care for
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
young people what's really interesting I
 
01:33:55.010 --> 01:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
don't have this data in here but it's
 
01:33:57.229 --> 01:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
it's the most fascinating data I'm
 
01:33:58.729 --> 01:33:58.739 align:start position:0%
seeing from this Juvenile Justice work
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
is the cans assessment so it looks at
 
01:34:03.169 --> 01:34:03.179 align:start position:0%
all different domains of child and
 
01:34:05.810 --> 01:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
family need right and
 
01:34:07.970 --> 01:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
um we get two interesting data points we
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
get the data point from law enforcement
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
as to what brought the child to our
 
01:34:13.610 --> 01:34:13.620 align:start position:0%
attention and overwhelmingly that's some
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
type of violence typically a more minor
 
01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
violence or a simple assault a fight
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
after school something like that is what
 
01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
brings them in but then when you do the
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
cans assessment which goes deeper the
 
01:34:24.530 --> 01:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
presenting issues have very little to do
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
with violence and have a lot to do with
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
depression and anxiety
 
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
right so the driving factors behind
 
01:34:31.850 --> 01:34:31.860 align:start position:0%
those those incidents that are bringing
 
01:34:33.850 --> 01:34:33.860 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in are actually
 
01:34:36.770 --> 01:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
depression and anxiety which often are
 
01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
things that you deal with more through
 
01:34:39.890 --> 01:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
an outpatient and then perhaps with some
 
01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
medication you know in partnership with
 
01:34:43.850 --> 01:34:43.860 align:start position:0%
your PCP so I think that's really the
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
space where I most see the need
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
um you know we've built out this this
 
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
higher intensity fast forward program
 
01:34:52.370 --> 01:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
and while there's room to grow there and
 
01:34:54.169 --> 01:34:54.179 align:start position:0%
we still have need there you know we're
 
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
on a trajectory with that but this this
 
01:34:58.250 --> 01:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
outpatient space is a space where I
 
01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
really feel like we have the the
 
01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:06.129 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:35:06.129 --> 01:35:06.139 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:35:08.209 --> 01:35:08.219 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
hi thank you chairman
 
01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:11.270 align:start position:0%
hi thank you chairman
um

01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
so if the outpatient realm is the
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
hardest that you're accessing then the
 
01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
only way to solve that is to get more
 
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
outpatient providers which is not an
 
01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
easy task because they have to be
 
01:35:23.930 --> 01:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
certified in their field before they can
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
offer therapy so
 
01:35:28.729 --> 01:35:28.739 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if there's
 
01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
an alternative pathway or if one can be
 
01:35:33.169 --> 01:35:33.179 align:start position:0%
developed if there's not one already
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
where they can have some sort of
 
01:35:40.729 --> 01:35:40.739 align:start position:0%
intervention with a provider that's not
 
01:35:40.739 --> 01:35:42.410 align:start position:0%
intervention with a provider that's not
necessarily

01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:35:45.770 --> 01:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
a counselor but so and I'm not I'm not
 
01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
trying to undermine you know mental
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
health it's very important but if
 
01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
there's some other way for them to get
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
what they need without having to see a
 
01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
counselor that's going to be the only
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
way we can solve this until we get more
 
01:35:59.629 --> 01:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
counselors in the field right
 
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and I'm not 100 sure the answer to
 
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
that right I'm not the expert in that
 
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
piece of it but I do think those are the
 
01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
types of solutions that we need to start
 
01:36:08.689 --> 01:36:08.699 align:start position:0%
talking about and thinking about right
 
01:36:10.490 --> 01:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
and I again I think you know we'll have
 
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
Rebecca Ross here it's a good thing to
 
01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
talk to our partners at Nami about it's
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
a good thing to talk to our licensing
 
01:36:17.689 --> 01:36:17.699 align:start position:0%
folks about right I think those are
 
01:36:19.129 --> 01:36:19.139 align:start position:0%
those are the types of conversations
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful
 
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
before Mr ribson resumes I'm going to be
 
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:28.860 align:start position:0%
living in a few minutes and
 
01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
representative long if you would take
 
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
the chair and adjourn about 12 10 I know
 
01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:36.530 align:start position:0%
the chair and adjourn about 12 10 I know
there's

01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
we're running over but you're going to
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
be invited back
 
01:36:43.610 --> 01:36:43.620 align:start position:0%
um so we'll pick up for it and I would
 
01:36:45.530 --> 01:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
say yeah I'd say to the committee please
 
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
be here at one we're going to start
 
01:36:54.770 --> 01:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:57.770 --> 01:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
all right thank you so if we move on to
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
the next page page eight
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
so we talked about the work we're doing
 
01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
on the Juvenile Justice side to try to
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
shift more Upstream identify families
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
needs we're trying to do something very
 
01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
similar on the child protection side and
 
01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
that's what what we're talking about on
 
01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
page eight here so create Pathways to
 
01:37:16.010 --> 01:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
identify needs and pro actively
 
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
guide children youth and families to
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate support before child and
 
01:37:23.149 --> 01:37:23.159 align:start position:0%
Community safety are jeopardized a
 
01:37:24.290 --> 01:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
couple different ways we've gone about
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
doing this one was doing some work on
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
our intake so intake is our hotline
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
right somebody suspects abuse or neglect
 
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
they're calling the hotline historically
 
01:37:35.570 --> 01:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
up until just a couple years ago if you
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
called that hotline with a concern for
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect you got one of two
 
01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
answers it was yes we're screening this
 
01:37:42.649 --> 01:37:42.659 align:start position:0%
in and we're going to investigate or no
 
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
we're not screening this in
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
and that was the entirety of it now much
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
of what we get calls about is not things
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
like sexual abuse and physical abuse
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
much of what we get calls about are
 
01:37:57.530 --> 01:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
things like neglect driven by poverty
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
driven by
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
unmet mental health needs driven by
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
unmet substance use disorders right so
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that comes into that
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
hotline that doesn't really reach the
 
01:38:10.669 --> 01:38:10.679 align:start position:0%
threshold of a child abuse or neglect
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
investigation but for which there is
 
01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
still a real need that needs to be
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
addressed and so the one of the first
 
01:38:18.649 --> 01:38:18.659 align:start position:0%
things we try to do is shift the way
 
01:38:20.570 --> 01:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
that our hotline practice worked to
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
offer a third option there so when
 
01:38:24.890 --> 01:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
somebody calls the hotline now
 
01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
most frequent callers you know we get
 
01:38:28.129 --> 01:38:28.139 align:start position:0%
calls from all different types of people
 
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
but the most frequent are teachers
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
that's who calls us more than anybody
 
01:38:31.199 --> 01:38:32.450 align:start position:0%
that's who calls us more than anybody
else

01:38:32.450 --> 01:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
um so now if Teacher Calls and they're
 
01:38:35.330 --> 01:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
calling and saying look Johnny is not
 
01:38:36.530 --> 01:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
coming to school with a coat in the
 
01:38:38.689 --> 01:38:38.699 align:start position:0%
winter that really is not a child abuse
 
01:38:40.729 --> 01:38:40.739 align:start position:0%
investigation but that is a kid that
 
01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
needs a coat that is a kid that needs to
 
01:38:45.290 --> 01:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
be directed to how to get a coat
 
01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
um so what will happen now is a hotline
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
caller will then refer that teacher and
 
01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
say look here's your local Family
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
Resource Center this is how you can help
 
01:38:54.110 --> 01:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
that kid access the code that they need
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
so they come to school with with their
 
01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:57.110 align:start position:0%
so they come to school with with their
coat

01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
coat
 
01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:58.129 align:start position:0%
coat
um

01:38:58.129 --> 01:38:58.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's felt pretty good unfortunately we
 
01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
actually haven't seen the numbers of
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
families showing up in Family Resource
 
01:39:07.729 --> 01:39:07.739 align:start position:0%
Centers grow as a result of that change
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
in our practice so it was nice that we
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
were able to offer that intervention but
 
01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
we actually haven't seen any real impact
 
01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:17.219 align:start position:0%
from it the call volumes remain the same
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
Our Family Resource Centers didn't
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
actually report more people showing up
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
so that you know it meant it wasn't
 
01:39:24.169 --> 01:39:24.179 align:start position:0%
particularly effective we're still doing
 
01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
it but we wanted to do something else so
 
01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
now we're working on two other things
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
big picture thing which probably will be
 
01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
live sometime this this time next year
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
is something called a community Response
 
01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:36.169 align:start position:0%
is something called a community Response

01:39:36.169 --> 01:39:36.179 align:start position:0%
Guide
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
what that's going to be it's a web-based
 
01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:39.709 align:start position:0%
what that's going to be it's a web-based
tool

01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
tool
 
01:39:41.570 --> 01:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
and it's available for and we're on page
 
01:39:42.890 --> 01:39:42.900 align:start position:0%
eight I see people flipping around just
 
01:39:46.189 --> 01:39:46.199 align:start position:0%
in case sorry it's a web-based tool for
 
01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
folks who are callers to the hotline to
 
01:39:50.090 --> 01:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
guide them through a decision tree
 
01:39:52.370 --> 01:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
around should you be calling the hotline
 
01:39:53.810 --> 01:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
or is there some other resource that's
 
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
good to help this family so imagine if
 
01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
you're the teacher and you're worried
 
01:39:59.629 --> 01:39:59.639 align:start position:0%
about sex abuse and you go to this tool
 
01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
and you start typing in it's going to
 
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
say call the hotline stop messing around
 
01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
on the internet and just call but if you
 
01:40:06.770 --> 01:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
go into this and you type in that you're
 
01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
worried about you know the child's
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
presenting without a code or they showed
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
up without
 
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
um they they're showing up without you
 
01:40:14.689 --> 01:40:14.699 align:start position:0%
know breakfast or something like that in
 
01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
the morning it'll do two different
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
things it'll guide you through some
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
questions to probe a little bit deeper
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
as to what's actually going on there it
 
01:40:21.709 --> 01:40:21.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't take identifying information
 
01:40:23.209 --> 01:40:23.219 align:start position:0%
there's nothing like that it's just
 
01:40:25.490 --> 01:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
scenario based and then at the end it'll
 
01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
do a couple things it'll say one you
 
01:40:29.209 --> 01:40:29.219 align:start position:0%
know here's information for say your
 
01:40:31.250 --> 01:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
local Family Resource Center your local
 
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
food pantry whatever it is so that you
 
01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
teacher can help connect that family to
 
01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
the resource or if you're not
 
01:40:38.689 --> 01:40:38.699 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that here's a phone
 
01:40:39.649 --> 01:40:39.659 align:start position:0%
number for somebody to call to come
 
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
Community Navigator so that's a new RFP
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
that we put out this past summer that
 
01:40:45.229 --> 01:40:45.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to have going live this
 
01:40:47.689 --> 01:40:47.699 align:start position:0%
spring and a community Navigator is a
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
person who can then pick up the phone
 
01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
and talk to that teacher or whomever the
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
caller is walk them through how do you
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
engage with that family to get them the
 
01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
support that they need this is the types
 
01:40:58.010 --> 01:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
of supports they need and if that
 
01:40:59.450 --> 01:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
teacher or whomever says I'm not
 
01:41:01.010 --> 01:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing that that's not my
 
01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
role then they say okay we'll call the
 
01:41:04.189 --> 01:41:04.199 align:start position:0%
Family ourselves
 
01:41:05.629 --> 01:41:05.639 align:start position:0%
and they'll reach out to the family and
 
01:41:06.830 --> 01:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
get the family the help that they need
 
01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
the Hope being that that intervention
 
01:41:10.729 --> 01:41:10.739 align:start position:0%
will actually connect those people to
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
the resources in a way that when we just
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
had our hotline doing it wasn't actually
 
01:41:16.610 --> 01:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
effective and the goal being that if we
 
01:41:18.050 --> 01:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
get more of these kids and families the
 
01:41:20.090 --> 01:41:20.100 align:start position:0%
things that they need early that we
 
01:41:21.530 --> 01:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
won't have them coming back into the
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
system for deeper needs later on
 
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
guide representative yes
 
01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:38.270 align:start position:0%
guide representative yes
um

01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
this is more than a question uh it's an
 
01:41:42.119 --> 01:41:43.669 align:start position:0%
this is more than a question uh it's an
observation

01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
observation
 
01:41:43.679 --> 01:41:45.350 align:start position:0%
observation
um

01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:47.090 --> 01:41:47.100 align:start position:0%
what I
 
01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
hear than what I see is
 
01:41:51.970 --> 01:41:51.980 align:start position:0%
um a lot of families
 
01:41:55.070 --> 01:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to asking for
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
assistant for food assistance or a
 
01:42:01.850 --> 01:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
winter jacket or things like that
 
01:42:04.250 --> 01:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
um a lot of people right now they're
 
01:42:07.250 --> 01:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
working through a temp agencies okay so
 
01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
during the holidays from Thanksgiving
 
01:42:12.890 --> 01:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
until New Year's the superior that
 
01:42:14.810 --> 01:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
people work in temp agencies that don't
 
01:42:17.090 --> 01:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
get paid for holidays
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
and they only get paid for a certain
 
01:42:20.770 --> 01:42:20.780 align:start position:0%
amount of hours
 
01:42:23.629 --> 01:42:23.639 align:start position:0%
my concern is that a lot of families
 
01:42:26.570 --> 01:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
don't go through the these agencies to
 
01:42:28.910 --> 01:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
ask for help because a lot of agencies
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
they ask for I pay stuff
 
01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
in a lot of this family they only go
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
through this heart shift or hard time
 
01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
during the holidays
 
01:42:41.810 --> 01:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
they they don't have enough money to
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
provide food or they don't have enough
 
01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
money to provide things for the kids
 
01:42:48.050 --> 01:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
and they make it difficult for a lot of
 
01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
people to qualify
 
01:42:53.930 --> 01:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
I just wonder if you know if we can find
 
01:42:55.490 --> 01:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
a waste
 
01:42:58.010 --> 01:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
to help children and families that the
 
01:43:00.010 --> 01:43:00.020 align:start position:0%
families don't feel like they have to
 
01:43:02.689 --> 01:43:02.699 align:start position:0%
bring a Bible completely Bible of
 
01:43:05.390 --> 01:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
documents just in order to get a jacket
 
01:43:08.330 --> 01:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
or a piece of bread for the kids because
 
01:43:10.189 --> 01:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of times that's what is happening
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
and I keep hearing from people in my own
 
01:43:15.770 --> 01:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
Community that's the problem that they
 
01:43:19.609 --> 01:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
give them 15 to 20 pages to fill that up
 
01:43:21.410 --> 01:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
just for a piece of jacket or piece of
 
01:43:23.450 --> 01:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
bread that the people just walk away
 
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
because they don't feel like that they
 
01:43:27.649 --> 01:43:27.659 align:start position:0%
have you know the time or that you know
 
01:43:30.290 --> 01:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
they need for a longer period of time so
 
01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:31.820 align:start position:0%
they just give up
 
01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
interesting yeah I mean I think the
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
so like the Family Resource Centers for
 
01:43:38.930 --> 01:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
example you know they don't they don't
 
01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:40.860 align:start position:0%
typically require anything like that for
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
folks to come in and you know but they
 
01:43:45.050 --> 01:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
also don't have as robust of a support
 
01:43:47.629 --> 01:43:47.639 align:start position:0%
service as say like a a TANF benefit
 
01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
where you do have to actually go through
 
01:43:51.890 --> 01:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
the whole qualification process and meet
 
01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
meet Federal requirements right I think
 
01:43:56.090 --> 01:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
it's it varies differently depending on
 
01:43:57.410 --> 01:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
the type of program the type of
 
01:43:59.930 --> 01:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
assistance that you're seeking I've
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
never actually heard of you know the
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
food pantries though being you know that
 
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
that intense in terms of being able to
 
01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:06.410 align:start position:0%
that intense in terms of being able to
provide

01:44:06.410 --> 01:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:44:07.970 --> 01:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
um you know food assistance to folks
 
01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
that type of food assistance but SNAP
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
benefits for example which is a federal
 
01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
program so I think a lot of it comes
 
01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
down to you know are you talking about
 
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
the federal programs which have some
 
01:44:19.490 --> 01:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
pretty rigorous requirements or you know
 
01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:20.820 align:start position:0%
some of these more local things where
 
01:44:22.609 --> 01:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
you're providing an actual concrete good
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
you know like you know an actual actual
 
01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
food or actual coat where they tend to
 
01:44:29.689 --> 01:44:29.699 align:start position:0%
be a little more you know a little you
 
01:44:31.550 --> 01:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
know more flexible with some of that
 
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
stuff but
 
01:44:34.609 --> 01:44:34.619 align:start position:0%
um it is a you know the the barrier
 
01:44:34.619 --> 01:44:35.390 align:start position:0%
um it is a you know the the barrier
issue

01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
our real challenge I think the stigma is
 
01:44:39.169 --> 01:44:39.179 align:start position:0%
a real challenge too in terms of folks
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know being afraid
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
um to come forward and you know identify
 
01:44:46.970 --> 01:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
this next page page nine
 
01:44:55.729 --> 01:44:55.739 align:start position:0%
so one of the areas where we've we've
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
had some growth over the past few years
 
01:44:58.370 --> 01:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
but there's probably a need for
 
01:45:01.970 --> 01:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
continued support is with our Family
 
01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
Resource Centers that I've mentioned a
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
few times so a couple years ago we
 
01:45:07.250 --> 01:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
contracted with our Family Resource
 
01:45:08.689 --> 01:45:08.699 align:start position:0%
Centers to set up what's called kinship
 
01:45:11.209 --> 01:45:11.219 align:start position:0%
navigation programs the kinship
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
navigation programs are programs for
 
01:45:18.169 --> 01:45:18.179 align:start position:0%
folks who are caring for kin kin being
 
01:45:22.970 --> 01:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
kind of anybody who um any child who has
 
01:45:24.530 --> 01:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
a connection to you right so it could be
 
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
your grandchild that's the most common
 
01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
scenario right grandparents caring for
 
01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
grandchild could be niece and nephew but
 
01:45:33.290 --> 01:45:33.300 align:start position:0%
could also be the person you know if
 
01:45:34.729 --> 01:45:34.739 align:start position:0%
you're the child you grew up calling
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
somebody auntie and they're not really
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
related to you but they could be caring
 
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
for you right and that's okay it could
 
01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
be a member of your faith community it
 
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
could be a neighbor it could be a coach
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
whomever right the idea being that
 
01:45:48.109 --> 01:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
there's all types of people in in in the
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
lives of families that are important in
 
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
that step up in times of needs and we
 
01:45:52.850 --> 01:45:52.860 align:start position:0%
need to be able to support those folks
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
the kinship Navigator programs are
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
relatively new to New Hampshire
 
01:45:58.729 --> 01:45:58.739 align:start position:0%
um and what they do is they provide kind
 
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
of support groups they help guide those
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
relatives or caregivers through
 
01:46:06.370 --> 01:46:06.380 align:start position:0%
accessing benefit services such as
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
relative caregivers are currently
 
01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
eligible for the TANF benefits to help
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
support the the costs of raising those
 
01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:12.609 align:start position:0%
support the the costs of raising those
kids

01:46:12.609 --> 01:46:12.619 align:start position:0%
kids
 
01:46:14.810 --> 01:46:14.820 align:start position:0%
help them guide them through the legal
 
01:46:16.129 --> 01:46:16.139 align:start position:0%
process if they need to obtain
 
01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
guardianship of a child or something
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
like that and I think one of the most
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
key important pieces helping guide them
 
01:46:24.430 --> 01:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
through kind of the the emotional
 
01:46:27.530 --> 01:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
challenges of changing the Dynamics and
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
roles within a family right if you're a
 
01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
grandparent and suddenly you're caring
 
01:46:33.169 --> 01:46:33.179 align:start position:0%
for your grandchild and maybe your Gran
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
your own child is maybe angry at you
 
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
over this scenario they feel you know
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
you might have a scenario where that
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
child is happy that you're helping him
 
01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
out you also get a scenario where that
 
01:46:43.490 --> 01:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
child's angry at you for interfering in
 
01:46:45.709 --> 01:46:45.719 align:start position:0%
their lives or you know it's it can be
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
really really tough for that parent or
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
that grandparent to manage so they
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
provide a lot of support for that stuff
 
01:46:52.850 --> 01:46:52.860 align:start position:0%
as well and those are relatively new
 
01:46:54.649 --> 01:46:54.659 align:start position:0%
they've been around here for was it
 
01:46:56.570 --> 01:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
maybe three years now yeah piloted in
 
01:46:58.669 --> 01:46:58.679 align:start position:0%
January 2020 Statewide September of
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
2020. and what you see on the right here
 
01:47:04.609 --> 01:47:04.619 align:start position:0%
is Our Family Resource Centers and the
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
number of new families that they're
 
01:47:07.970 --> 01:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
actually encountering every single
 
01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:09.050 align:start position:0%
actually encountering every single
quarter

01:47:09.050 --> 01:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
quarter
 
01:47:10.970 --> 01:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
and every single quarter our family
 
01:47:12.530 --> 01:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
resource center is around the state are
 
01:47:15.290 --> 01:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
encountering close to a thousand eight
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
hundred nine hundred new families that's
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
new families walking into Family
 
01:47:20.330 --> 01:47:20.340 align:start position:0%
Resource Centers every quarter by
 
01:47:23.450 --> 01:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
program type which is huge
 
01:47:25.370 --> 01:47:25.380 align:start position:0%
and you know I think just goes to speak
 
01:47:27.050 --> 01:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
to the amount of need out there and
 
01:47:28.850 --> 01:47:28.860 align:start position:0%
these Family Resource Centers really are
 
01:47:30.530 --> 01:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
you know they're really operating on
 
01:47:32.689 --> 01:47:32.699 align:start position:0%
kind of a shoestring budget funded
 
01:47:35.870 --> 01:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
largely by philanthropy and fundraising
 
01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:37.310 align:start position:0%
largely by philanthropy and fundraising
and

01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
um you know not really fully funded by
 
01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
the state they're getting kind of a
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
little bit of money from us to kind of
 
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
help keep themselves afloat but uh but
 
01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
not you know much of their much of their
 
01:47:49.970 --> 01:47:49.980 align:start position:0%
need being being met by private
 
01:47:51.890 --> 01:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
fundraising and things like that and
 
01:47:53.689 --> 01:47:53.699 align:start position:0%
they really are a key part of the social
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
service system that we expect to meet
 
01:47:58.490 --> 01:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
the needs of our young folks and our and
 
01:48:01.729 --> 01:48:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:03.590 --> 01:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
any questions on this
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton
 
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
so do you I'm kind of a little confused
 
01:48:12.890 --> 01:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
about this graph so it's new families
 
01:48:16.129 --> 01:48:16.139 align:start position:0%
each quarter but are the old ones still
 
01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
being served as well or do you kind of
 
01:48:21.290 --> 01:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
start and finish them within one quarter
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
oh no they could still be they could
 
01:48:25.790 --> 01:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
still be being served this was just this
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
was just representative of how many
 
01:48:29.330 --> 01:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
families were walking in new every
 
01:48:31.250 --> 01:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
single quarter to show that there's you
 
01:48:32.930 --> 01:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
know new demand to constantly coming
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
into these places
 
01:48:36.290 --> 01:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
so basically your workload is
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
exponential then
 
01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:41.689 align:start position:0%
exponential then
essentially

01:48:41.689 --> 01:48:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
enjoy that before I forget
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
um there was a list of acronyms that we
 
01:48:48.590 --> 01:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
received last term I'm wondering if uh
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
Miss Dwyer could receive a list of
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
acronyms that the dcyf has yes would be
 
01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
helpful did we put that together or who
 
01:48:59.149 --> 01:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
put that together last time
 
01:48:59.159 --> 01:49:02.209 align:start position:0%
put that together last time
okay

01:49:02.209 --> 01:49:02.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:04.129 --> 01:49:04.139 align:start position:0%
I believe we got it from Rebecca Ross
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it was a yeah I think it was a
 
01:49:08.570 --> 01:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
DHHS wide acronym list we can do that
 
01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:10.679 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you we could get that
 
01:49:12.169 --> 01:49:12.179 align:start position:0%
out thanks
 
01:49:13.609 --> 01:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know how long you want to
 
01:49:15.590 --> 01:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
go I'll I'll keep going until you tell
 
01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
me you're ready to another five minutes
 
01:49:19.370 --> 01:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
okay great so that'll get us kind of
 
01:49:20.689 --> 01:49:20.699 align:start position:0%
through this first part and then we'll
 
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
get into the we can get into the deeper
 
01:49:24.290 --> 01:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
stuff at another
 
01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:26.890 align:start position:0%
stuff at another
conversation

01:49:26.890 --> 01:49:26.900 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
next page page 10
 
01:49:31.729 --> 01:49:31.739 align:start position:0%
. so this is talking about
 
01:49:34.189 --> 01:49:34.199 align:start position:0%
community-based voluntary services so
 
01:49:36.590 --> 01:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
dcyf as I said before historically we
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
could only offer a service to a family
 
01:49:39.890 --> 01:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
once we got court involved and once a
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
court ordered service came into place we
 
01:49:44.510 --> 01:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
changed the law for that shortly after I
 
01:49:47.410 --> 01:49:47.420 align:start position:0%
arrived back in 20 maybe 19
 
01:49:50.169 --> 01:49:50.179 align:start position:0%
2018 maybe we changed the law for that
 
01:49:52.370 --> 01:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
so that we could offer voluntary
 
01:49:54.290 --> 01:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
services to families but the reality was
 
01:49:55.850 --> 01:49:55.860 align:start position:0%
is that we didn't have the workforce to
 
01:49:57.709 --> 01:49:57.719 align:start position:0%
offer too many voluntary services to
 
01:49:59.570 --> 01:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
families because we just right there's a
 
01:50:00.890 --> 01:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
lot of need out there and we just don't
 
01:50:03.890 --> 01:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
have the staff to meet all of that so
 
01:50:05.450 --> 01:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
what we designed instead was this idea
 
01:50:06.890 --> 01:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
of community-based voluntary Services
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
where we contracted with a couple
 
01:50:10.430 --> 01:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
entities to work with families who were
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
identified as high risk of coming back
 
01:50:14.810 --> 01:50:14.820 align:start position:0%
to the child protection system but for
 
01:50:17.149 --> 01:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
whom there was not active abuse or
 
01:50:19.850 --> 01:50:19.860 align:start position:0%
neglect requiring a current court case
 
01:50:22.430 --> 01:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
so every single time Child Protection
 
01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
does an assessment we do two things we
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
do an assessment to see was there abuse
 
01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
or neglect as defined by New Hampshire
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
law yes or no and and two we do an
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
assessment as to is there what's the
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
risk in this household How likely is it
 
01:50:37.970 --> 01:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
that this household is going to come
 
01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
back to our attention based on what's
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
happening in this household
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
the first question was there abuse
 
01:50:45.649 --> 01:50:45.659 align:start position:0%
neglect we only answer that question yes
 
01:50:47.149 --> 01:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
about eight percent of the time believe
 
01:50:49.370 --> 01:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
it or not it's very rare you know New
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a pretty high threshold for
 
01:50:53.290 --> 01:50:53.300 align:start position:0%
what qualifies as abuse or neglect
 
01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
but the second question of risk about a
 
01:50:58.189 --> 01:50:58.199 align:start position:0%
third of our families come back is high
 
01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
risk so that meant and we've been doing
 
01:51:03.050 --> 01:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
this for 15 20 years so that meant that
 
01:51:04.490 --> 01:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
all that time that we could only offer
 
01:51:06.410 --> 01:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
services when you had a court order
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
which was only when you could
 
01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:09.719 align:start position:0%
substantiate abuse or neglect that our
 
01:51:10.970 --> 01:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
staff were going out there and they were
 
01:51:10.980 --> 01:51:12.229 align:start position:0%
staff were going out there and they were
identifying

01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
identifying
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
one-third of our families as being high
 
01:51:15.770 --> 01:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
risk of coming back and they weren't
 
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
able to offer them any service even
 
01:51:19.250 --> 01:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
though we knew and we were assessing
 
01:51:20.689 --> 01:51:20.699 align:start position:0%
that they were likely to come back to us
 
01:51:22.910 --> 01:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
so what community-based voluntary
 
01:51:24.530 --> 01:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
Services is is whenever we have an
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
assessment that comes back as high risk
 
01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
those families are offered to this
 
01:51:29.629 --> 01:51:29.639 align:start position:0%
voluntary intervention to work with a
 
01:51:31.129 --> 01:51:31.139 align:start position:0%
community-based program
 
01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
in most of the state Waypoint holds the
 
01:51:36.290 --> 01:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
contract up in the North Country the
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Center at Gorham holds
 
01:51:40.370 --> 01:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
the contract and the way that that works
 
01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
is during our assessment process we'll
 
01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
connect those families to these
 
01:51:46.609 --> 01:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
providers these providers that Outreach
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
to them and they try to get the family
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
to agree to come in work with them they
 
01:51:52.189 --> 01:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
do some planning with the family they
 
01:51:54.050 --> 01:51:54.060 align:start position:0%
use a model called solution-based
 
01:51:55.970 --> 01:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
casework where they kind of identify
 
01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
what the family's needs are how to build
 
01:51:59.689 --> 01:51:59.699 align:start position:0%
up natural supports that's the idea of
 
01:52:01.010 --> 01:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
building your community around your
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
family to help support your family
 
01:52:04.370 --> 01:52:04.380 align:start position:0%
and help make sure that they're
 
01:52:05.689 --> 01:52:05.699 align:start position:0%
connected to whatever other resources
 
01:52:07.010 --> 01:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
they need in their Community to be
 
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
successful and hopefully prevent that
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
family from coming back to us a second
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
time you know historically what we see
 
01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
is families cycling through the system
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again so this is
 
01:52:18.410 --> 01:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
pretty exciting that this is finally
 
01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:19.669 align:start position:0%
pretty exciting that this is finally
live

01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
live
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
um you know started March of 2021
 
01:52:26.209 --> 01:52:26.219 align:start position:0%
serving families last year served 861
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
families this year served a little over
 
01:52:31.129 --> 01:52:31.139 align:start position:0%
a thousand families
 
01:52:32.689 --> 01:52:32.699 align:start position:0%
the next
 
01:52:32.699 --> 01:52:35.209 align:start position:0%
the next
slide

01:52:35.209 --> 01:52:35.219 align:start position:0%
slide
 
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
yes oh sorry chair hi I'm Lori law I'm
 
01:52:42.590 --> 01:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
so sorry no that's right
 
01:52:45.410 --> 01:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
um I apologize I just wanted to um
 
01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
clarify I'm just wondering if you have a
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
partnership with the school districts um
 
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
when these families are identified like
 
01:52:53.570 --> 01:52:53.580 align:start position:0%
this and um does the school are they
 
01:52:55.129 --> 01:52:55.139 align:start position:0%
made aware of the family so that they
 
01:52:56.810 --> 01:52:56.820 align:start position:0%
can also step in
 
01:52:56.820 --> 01:52:58.129 align:start position:0%
can also step in
so

01:52:58.129 --> 01:52:58.139 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
child abuse neglect is is a difficult
 
01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
area because there's a lot of
 
01:53:03.590 --> 01:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
confidentiality around what we can and
 
01:53:06.290 --> 01:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
can't share and if a call comes in from
 
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
a school then there's information that
 
01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
can be shared back but unless the call
 
01:53:12.050 --> 01:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
comes from the school other than us
 
01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
doing an investigation and speaking to
 
01:53:15.050 --> 01:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
the school and trying to elicit
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
information is not a whole lot of
 
01:53:17.570 --> 01:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
information that gets shared back
 
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
directly with the school district
 
01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
where there where the schools can get
 
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
involved though is kind of in the
 
01:53:24.649 --> 01:53:24.659 align:start position:0%
service provision aspect of it so not in
 
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
the investigation part but the service
 
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
piece right so when we talked earlier
 
01:53:29.930 --> 01:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
about something like fast forward and
 
01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
you have kind of your High Fidelity rap
 
01:53:33.229 --> 01:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
team the school should be sitting at
 
01:53:35.570 --> 01:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
that table if we have a child in foster
 
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
care for example and we're doing
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
planning the school should be sitting at
 
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
that table for a program on
 
01:53:41.709 --> 01:53:41.719 align:start position:0%
community-based voluntary Services
 
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
ideally the school is engaged at that
 
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
table so it's really there's a little
 
01:53:47.209 --> 01:53:47.219 align:start position:0%
bit of confusion around kind of how and
 
01:53:50.570 --> 01:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
when those connections happen it's a
 
01:53:51.649 --> 01:53:51.659 align:start position:0%
little bit trickier around the
 
01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
investigation space but but more
 
01:53:55.970 --> 01:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
comfortable and common around that kind
 
01:53:57.770 --> 01:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
of service provision space
 
01:53:59.450 --> 01:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
okay that makes sense yeah that's what I
 
01:54:00.890 --> 01:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
was wondering because
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
um not that you would have to share a
 
01:54:04.010 --> 01:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
lot but if you had high risk children
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
and you just say we have children at
 
01:54:07.729 --> 01:54:07.739 align:start position:0%
risk and they don't need the extra
 
01:54:09.530 --> 01:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
background or are they referred to a
 
01:54:11.450 --> 01:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
special education are they referred as
 
01:54:13.490 --> 01:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
other things ruled out for those yeah
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
for that family is what I was wondering
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:22.970 --> 01:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
all right um next slide page 11 is just
 
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
talking about Staffing our child
 
01:54:27.229 --> 01:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
protection Workforce so when
 
01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
um I first got here five years ago case
 
01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
loads for child protection assessment
 
01:54:34.370 --> 01:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
workers were in the 60s
 
01:54:36.050 --> 01:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
um shortly before that they were in the
 
01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:37.669 align:start position:0%
um shortly before that they were in the
90s

01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
90s
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
um the standard nationally you know
 
01:54:42.169 --> 01:54:42.179 align:start position:0%
should be not that Most states meet this
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
but should be 12. that's the case load
 
01:54:45.950 --> 01:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
that we should be expecting staff to
 
01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:47.229 align:start position:0%
that we should be expecting staff to
manage

01:54:47.229 --> 01:54:47.239 align:start position:0%
manage
 
01:54:49.609 --> 01:54:49.619 align:start position:0%
we're currently we've been pretty good
 
01:54:51.649 --> 01:54:51.659 align:start position:0%
good being able to hold in kind of like
 
01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
the mid to high teens for the past
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
couple years
 
01:54:56.450 --> 01:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
um but we haven't been able to kind of
 
01:54:58.609 --> 01:54:58.619 align:start position:0%
get down to that that 12th number that
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
our goal is a couple years ago when when
 
01:55:03.590 --> 01:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
lots of Investments were made for this
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
purpose we were we did a deep analysis
 
01:55:07.370 --> 01:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
as to how many staff we actually needed
 
01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
to get to that threshold number of 12
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
and we actually I think do have the
 
01:55:13.070 --> 01:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
right number of staff on paper
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
to get to that but we haven't been able
 
01:55:16.609 --> 01:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
to fill enough positions to actually get
 
01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
to that number
 
01:55:19.370 --> 01:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
um where you know
 
01:55:20.810 --> 01:55:20.820 align:start position:0%
I think today we're actually doing a
 
01:55:22.129 --> 01:55:22.139 align:start position:0%
little better than we have been for the
 
01:55:23.570 --> 01:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
past few months
 
01:55:25.010 --> 01:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
um you know we really had a bit of a
 
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
downslide I think between
 
01:55:31.070 --> 01:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
late last winter through about October
 
01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
November and then we kind of saw our
 
01:55:34.370 --> 01:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
hiring be able to pick up again you know
 
01:55:35.330 --> 01:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
I've heard different things about
 
01:55:37.850 --> 01:55:37.860 align:start position:0%
changes in the in kind of Workforce
 
01:55:39.290 --> 01:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
hiring and kind of Health and Human
 
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
Services hiring in general that was
 
01:55:43.129 --> 01:55:43.139 align:start position:0%
certainly we've seen on our side so I'm
 
01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
hopeful that we'll start to see that
 
01:55:46.729 --> 01:55:46.739 align:start position:0%
pick up but we certainly saw a pretty
 
01:55:50.450 --> 01:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
tough go of um of hiring Workforce kind
 
01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
of in the post-covet environment both in
 
01:55:56.330 --> 01:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
the child protection sphere and um in
 
01:56:03.250 --> 01:56:03.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:06.290 --> 01:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to speak to what it was
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
when I left in 2017
 
01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
um but I'm curious if these numbers are
 
01:56:15.169 --> 01:56:15.179 align:start position:0%
for um all staff or if it's just uh or
 
01:56:17.090 --> 01:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
if foster care Staffing is a little bit
 
01:56:19.070 --> 01:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
better because I know in the past it was
 
01:56:21.649 --> 01:56:21.659 align:start position:0%
like 20ish for foster care and the goal
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
is 12-ish yeah this is this is
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
assessment staff
 
01:56:28.910 --> 01:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
um family service so is what we call the
 
01:56:31.310 --> 01:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
the foster care Staffing the goal for
 
01:56:32.930 --> 01:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
that's actually 10 and that hovers more
 
01:56:34.970 --> 01:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
around the 15 number okay thank you oh
 
01:56:36.410 --> 01:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
yeah both of them are higher than we
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
want to be but they're they're better
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:43.199 --> 01:56:45.649 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:56:45.649 --> 01:56:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:48.890 --> 01:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
Joe we're gonna call it what's there uh
 
01:56:50.689 --> 01:56:50.699 align:start position:0%
we're gonna recess for lunch and come

and number two
 
02:53:12.230 --> 02:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
guess guess what's next
 
02:53:14.809 --> 02:53:14.819 align:start position:0%
that's three number two is you gotta
 
02:53:16.070 --> 02:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
turn the mic on

and you do that by yeah and you know
 
02:53:19.429 --> 02:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
you've done it because the red light
 
02:53:21.950 --> 02:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
comes on and then you got to speak right
 
02:53:25.429 --> 02:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
into it okay okay so do one you've done
 
02:53:27.769 --> 02:53:27.779 align:start position:0%
two and keep three in mind thank you

okay well good morning uh Mr chairman
 
02:53:34.610 --> 02:53:34.620 align:start position:0%
Vice chair and members of the committee
 
02:53:37.610 --> 02:53:37.620 align:start position:0%
my name is Jay Markell I'm a practicing
 
02:53:39.710 --> 02:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
family law attorney in New Hampshire and
 
02:53:42.650 --> 02:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
have been admitted closer oh okay thank
 
02:53:44.150 --> 02:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
you and have been admitted to the New
 
02:53:47.570 --> 02:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire bar since 1998.
 
02:53:50.570 --> 02:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
um I was also involved in drafting some
 
02:53:53.210 --> 02:53:53.220 align:start position:0%
family law legislation working with
 
02:53:55.849 --> 02:53:55.859 align:start position:0%
representative Deb D Simone and others
 
02:53:58.969 --> 02:53:58.979 align:start position:0%
over the last few years and one of them
 
02:54:00.530 --> 02:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
has been involvement with alimony
 
02:54:03.490 --> 02:54:03.500 align:start position:0%
particularly the alimony statute which
 
02:54:06.349 --> 02:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
ultimately a different version became
 
02:54:09.830 --> 02:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
law back around 2019 while the law does
 
02:54:11.630 --> 02:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
a number of good things there are some
 
02:54:13.550 --> 02:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
flaws in it that need to be corrected
 
02:54:15.590 --> 02:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
and actually they're more in the nature
 
02:54:19.130 --> 02:54:19.140 align:start position:0%
of housekeeping details what brings us
 
02:54:24.550 --> 02:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:27.309 --> 02:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
section of RSA
 
02:54:27.319 --> 02:54:29.469 align:start position:0%
section of RSA
45819

02:54:29.469 --> 02:54:29.479 align:start position:0%
45819
 
02:54:32.590 --> 02:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
what it does is that it defines
 
02:54:35.330 --> 02:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
temporary alimony and by the way I can
 
02:54:38.269 --> 02:54:38.279 align:start position:0%
give some handouts here for distribution
 
02:54:40.730 --> 02:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
which I think may help clarify should I
 
02:54:43.250 --> 02:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
just leave them here or to pass I would
 
02:54:46.969 --> 02:54:46.979 align:start position:0%
suggest you walk them to my honorable
 
02:54:48.889 --> 02:54:48.899 align:start position:0%
committee researcher who will pass them
 
02:54:51.230 --> 02:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
around okay thank you there are two sets
 
02:54:55.910 --> 02:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
of statutes there one is uh 458 19 and
 
02:54:59.570 --> 02:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
458 19a
 
02:55:02.090 --> 02:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
um okay so what this bill does is that
 
02:55:04.309 --> 02:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
it looks at 458
 
02:55:05.990 --> 02:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay I just want to get the definition
 
02:55:10.070 --> 02:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
section here 458 19 which is being
 
02:55:12.410 --> 02:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
passed around and I've put a check mark
 
02:55:16.910 --> 02:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
it's on page two and it deals with 458
 
02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:18.010 align:start position:0%
it's on page two and it deals with 458
um

02:55:18.010 --> 02:55:18.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:20.269 --> 02:55:20.279 align:start position:0%
458 19
 
02:55:23.570 --> 02:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
section 14 where it defines temporary
 
02:55:26.510 --> 02:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
alimony as being the periodic support
 
02:55:28.670 --> 02:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
payments two are on behalf of a spouse
 
02:55:31.010 --> 02:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
while a case is pending and ending on
 
02:55:32.929 --> 02:55:32.939 align:start position:0%
the effective date of divorce or legal
 
02:55:35.690 --> 02:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
separation or annulment and such and
 
02:55:37.969 --> 02:55:37.979 align:start position:0%
that such alimony shall not be counted
 
02:55:39.950 --> 02:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
towards the subject or either the
 
02:55:43.849 --> 02:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
formula or duration limits of 458 1983
 
02:55:46.429 --> 02:55:46.439 align:start position:0%
unless the court finds that the
 
02:55:49.010 --> 02:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
temporary alimony was of unusually long
 
02:55:52.910 --> 02:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
duration now the
 
02:55:55.849 --> 02:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
problem here is is that the entire
 
02:55:57.950 --> 02:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
intent of the statute isn't initially
 
02:56:01.849 --> 02:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
passed was designed to order to predict
 
02:56:04.670 --> 02:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
predictability into alimony statutes in
 
02:56:07.030 --> 02:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
other words before
 
02:56:09.349 --> 02:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
it's still pretty much going to the
 
02:56:11.389 --> 02:56:11.399 align:start position:0%
casino and you may not know what you get
 
02:56:13.429 --> 02:56:13.439 align:start position:0%
but at least you have guidelines to work
 
02:56:17.030 --> 02:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
with the guy and what this bill does is
 
02:56:20.030 --> 02:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
that it simply brings temporary alimony
 
02:56:23.570 --> 02:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
of whatever duration to be paid okay in
 
02:56:25.910 --> 02:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
Conformity with
 
02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:27.650 align:start position:0%
Conformity with
um

02:56:27.650 --> 02:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:31.070 --> 02:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh with can in Conformity with
 
02:56:33.790 --> 02:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
um 458
 
02:56:37.370 --> 02:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
19a2 a which says that they'll both be
 
02:56:39.889 --> 02:56:39.899 align:start position:0%
subject to the same regulations now
 
02:56:42.469 --> 02:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
currently that means the uh lesser of
 
02:56:46.849 --> 02:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
the reasonable need of the payee or it
 
02:56:50.750 --> 02:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
would mean a maximum of 23 percent as
 
02:56:53.269 --> 02:56:53.279 align:start position:0%
the as the law stands currently excuse
 
02:56:55.429 --> 02:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
me Council I'm going to ask you to stop
 
02:56:56.929 --> 02:56:56.939 align:start position:0%
for a minute I've got this stack of
 
02:56:58.969 --> 02:56:58.979 align:start position:0%
papers there's no Staples anywhere and
 
02:57:00.590 --> 02:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
there's numbers of pages that look
 
02:57:03.230 --> 02:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
different to each other so I'm a bit at
 
02:57:05.570 --> 02:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
a loss as to how many pages I get okay
 
02:57:08.389 --> 02:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
well you get a total of okay I'm sorry
 
02:57:13.849 --> 02:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:15.769 --> 02:57:15.779 align:start position:0%
I can give you my copies if you like
 
02:57:19.070 --> 02:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
well I'd like about 16 of them okay well
 
02:57:22.730 --> 02:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
then I can staple them uh if need be
 
02:57:26.870 --> 02:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
um what it is is that it's 458 19a and
 
02:57:29.450 --> 02:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
it has its and it's a total of four
 
02:57:33.590 --> 02:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
pages and 458
 
02:57:36.230 --> 02:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
19 which has a total of two pages okay
 
02:57:37.929 --> 02:57:37.939 align:start position:0%
so the it starts with the letter
 
02:57:41.990 --> 02:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
parentheses G that's the first page
 
02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:42.790 align:start position:0%
parentheses G that's the first page
um

02:57:42.790 --> 02:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:46.010 --> 02:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
the first page is uh are you looking at
 
02:57:52.610 --> 02:57:52.620 align:start position:0%
458 19a or 458 19. 458 19a okay 19a
 
02:57:55.670 --> 02:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
begins with the letter one it says the
 
02:57:57.650 --> 02:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
court May order term alimony upon
 
02:57:57.660 --> 02:57:58.389 align:start position:0%
court May order term alimony upon
payment

02:57:58.389 --> 02:57:58.399 align:start position:0%
payment
 
02:58:00.950 --> 02:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
upon agreement of the party right now I
 
02:58:05.090 --> 02:58:05.100 align:start position:0%
am totally lost on this this this is
 
02:58:08.690 --> 02:58:08.700 align:start position:0%
okay needs to be redone okay well the um
 
02:58:10.550 --> 02:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
the essence of the bill is simply this
 
02:58:14.570 --> 02:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
it brings it into Conformity and um I'm
 
02:58:17.510 --> 02:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
happy to provide stapled copies that I
 
02:58:18.650 --> 02:58:18.660 align:start position:0%
have here
 
02:58:22.730 --> 02:58:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:26.269 --> 02:58:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:28.969 --> 02:58:28.979 align:start position:0%
if you would give your copy to my
 
02:58:30.830 --> 02:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
committee researcher granted this is not
 
02:58:33.830 --> 02:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
research but she she's multitaskable and
 
02:58:35.389 --> 02:58:35.399 align:start position:0%
take this watch of things here and
 
02:58:37.849 --> 02:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
purloin a stapler from somewhere
 
02:58:41.750 --> 02:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:44.929 --> 02:58:44.939 align:start position:0%
thank you okay okay sorry about that Mr
 
02:58:47.570 --> 02:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
chairman okay the the point of it is is
 
02:58:49.010 --> 02:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
that it really just makes one small
 
02:58:51.950 --> 02:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
correction and what it says is is that
 
02:58:53.929 --> 02:58:53.939 align:start position:0%
it just brings it into Conformity the
 
02:58:55.910 --> 02:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
idea of bringing it into Conformity is
 
02:58:57.469 --> 02:58:57.479 align:start position:0%
is that unless you have immediate
 
02:59:02.389 --> 02:59:02.399 align:start position:0%
irreparable harm uh facing a payee uh
 
02:59:04.130 --> 02:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
for some reason that isn't foreseeable
 
02:59:06.590 --> 02:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
that it simply puts alimony in the same
 
02:59:09.050 --> 02:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
category temporary alimony in this in
 
02:59:11.769 --> 02:59:11.779 align:start position:0%
the same duration limits as term alimony
 
02:59:14.330 --> 02:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
uh and by the way that doesn't paint
 
02:59:17.389 --> 02:59:17.399 align:start position:0%
anybody into a corner the idea here is
 
02:59:20.210 --> 02:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
is that if you have some extraordinary
 
02:59:24.110 --> 02:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
circumstance that wasn't foreseeable and
 
02:59:26.150 --> 02:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
that you need to vary from that formula
 
02:59:29.630 --> 02:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
you can okay just tell us what it is and
 
02:59:32.030 --> 02:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
why it's irony and why you need it and
 
02:59:33.889 --> 02:59:33.899 align:start position:0%
why this is going to be irreparable harm
 
02:59:36.230 --> 02:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
if it's not granted
 
02:59:38.150 --> 02:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
um now the other question that typically
 
02:59:42.950 --> 02:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
you might run into is uh well
 
02:59:42.960 --> 02:59:43.849 align:start position:0%
you might run into is uh well
um

02:59:43.849 --> 02:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:46.190 --> 02:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
if we have that what about other bills
 
02:59:50.450 --> 02:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
if the order of alimony simply isn't of
 
02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
enough to be able to compensate somebody
 
02:59:55.070 --> 02:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
for bills well if you have that kind of
 
02:59:57.410 --> 02:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
income disparity there is absolutely
 
03:00:00.830 --> 03:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
nothing precluding a court ordering that
 
03:00:03.170 --> 03:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
in addition to the required alimony
 
03:00:06.290 --> 03:00:06.300 align:start position:0%
amount that a disparity of income person
 
03:00:08.330 --> 03:00:08.340 align:start position:0%
who's making a lot of money can be
 
03:00:09.650 --> 03:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
ordered to pay
 
03:00:12.230 --> 03:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
bills in addition to the temporary
 
03:00:15.250 --> 03:00:15.260 align:start position:0%
alimony so that means nobody would be
 
03:00:18.650 --> 03:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
conceivably left destitute nobody would
 
03:00:20.870 --> 03:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
ever receive basically a quote
 
03:00:23.809 --> 03:00:23.819 align:start position:0%
inadequate alimony award because alimony
 
03:00:28.250 --> 03:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
is only one piece of a divorce puzzle
 
03:00:30.469 --> 03:00:30.479 align:start position:0%
um and that's really it very Simply Now
 
03:00:32.389 --> 03:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
the problem so one of the questions that
 
03:00:34.490 --> 03:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
might come up is why do we need this
 
03:00:36.950 --> 03:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
well the problem is is that you can get
 
03:00:39.410 --> 03:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
all kinds of insane things going on in
 
03:00:41.330 --> 03:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
court and it undermines the entire
 
03:00:43.450 --> 03:00:43.460 align:start position:0%
intent of the statute which is
 
03:00:47.150 --> 03:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
predictability uh uh you know I had one
 
03:00:51.230 --> 03:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
case where uh the alimony Seeker trumped
 
03:00:52.849 --> 03:00:52.859 align:start position:0%
up a bunch of a number of things
 
03:00:54.469 --> 03:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
ultimately we had to go through
 
03:00:56.870 --> 03:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
Discovery the court ended up referring
 
03:00:58.490 --> 03:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
the matter to the county attorney's
 
03:01:00.650 --> 03:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
office for perjury and fraud and a bunch
 
03:01:02.690 --> 03:01:02.700 align:start position:0%
of other things that's the kind of abuse
 
03:01:05.269 --> 03:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
that it opens the door to
 
03:01:07.130 --> 03:01:07.140 align:start position:0%
um so that's really it in a nutshell and
 
03:01:08.690 --> 03:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
if there's any questions I'm happy to
 
03:01:11.929 --> 03:01:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:13.849 --> 03:01:13.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:01:16.190 --> 03:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative long
 
03:01:18.950 --> 03:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
03:01:23.090 --> 03:01:23.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Markle uh the uh so this
 
03:01:25.010 --> 03:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
also adds a court show
 
03:01:27.110 --> 03:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
make written finding support in its
 
03:01:29.150 --> 03:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
artists also so that's that in addition
 
03:01:31.309 --> 03:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
to what's currently in there now that's
 
03:01:33.290 --> 03:01:33.300 align:start position:0%
correct right so the rest of the alimony
 
03:01:36.590 --> 03:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
statute stays intact all this is really
 
03:01:39.610 --> 03:01:39.620 align:start position:0%
is just correcting an oversight okay so
 
03:01:43.250 --> 03:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh follow up on me follow up thank you
 
03:01:46.190 --> 03:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh so I had wrote a note that it first
 
03:01:49.370 --> 03:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
requires Court finding but that doesn't
 
03:01:52.070 --> 03:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
change from the what's originally in
 
03:01:54.349 --> 03:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
statute no it doesn't change it in other
 
03:01:56.450 --> 03:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
words the the rest of the statute stays
 
03:01:58.550 --> 03:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
the same okay what it just says is the
 
03:01:59.870 --> 03:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
Court's simply going to make written
 
03:02:02.150 --> 03:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
findings for its order and you know
 
03:02:04.070 --> 03:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's not a burden on the court and
 
03:02:06.710 --> 03:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
what it does is it just makes everything
 
03:02:08.870 --> 03:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
more predictable and actually it helps
 
03:02:13.309 --> 03:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
for both sides uh a potential payee can
 
03:02:16.010 --> 03:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
go if the potential payee is represented
 
03:02:18.050 --> 03:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
by Council I'm sorry this is in the way
 
03:02:20.929 --> 03:02:20.939 align:start position:0%
here so I okay there's a potential payee
 
03:02:22.969 --> 03:02:22.979 align:start position:0%
if represented by Council can go in and
 
03:02:25.370 --> 03:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
say okay well you can ask for temporary
 
03:02:28.130 --> 03:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
alimony this is what it would be but if
 
03:02:29.929 --> 03:02:29.939 align:start position:0%
you feel this is inadequate we can go in
 
03:02:32.630 --> 03:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
and we can ask that other bills be paid
 
03:02:35.809 --> 03:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
in addition to alimony so uh we can get
 
03:02:37.490 --> 03:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
the mortgage paid we can get the
 
03:02:39.769 --> 03:02:39.779 align:start position:0%
utilities paid we can get the this paid
 
03:02:41.929 --> 03:02:41.939 align:start position:0%
we can get that paid as long as there's
 
03:02:44.570 --> 03:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
an ability to pay
 
03:02:46.730 --> 03:02:46.740 align:start position:0%
um now from the payees now from the
 
03:02:49.429 --> 03:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
potential payor's side the benefits to
 
03:02:52.010 --> 03:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
both Council and pro se are that you can
 
03:02:54.050 --> 03:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
say to yourself okay well this is what I
 
03:02:55.670 --> 03:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
would be expected to pay if the court
 
03:02:57.769 --> 03:02:57.779 align:start position:0%
finds that the rest of the factors are
 
03:02:57.779 --> 03:02:58.550 align:start position:0%
finds that the rest of the factors are
there

03:02:58.550 --> 03:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:03:00.950 --> 03:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
so in other words it just kind of evens
 
03:03:03.050 --> 03:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
things out makes it simpler and easier
 
03:03:05.150 --> 03:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
to understand so you don't get some of
 
03:03:06.410 --> 03:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
the kind of
 
03:03:10.190 --> 03:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
frankly crazed pleadings and sometimes
 
03:03:12.769 --> 03:03:12.779 align:start position:0%
unpredictable orders that that can
 
03:03:14.570 --> 03:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
result from this kind of thing
 
03:03:17.090 --> 03:03:17.100 align:start position:0%
thank you sure
 
03:03:19.730 --> 03:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton thank you Mr
 
03:03:19.740 --> 03:03:20.870 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton thank you Mr
chairman

03:03:20.870 --> 03:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:03:24.170 --> 03:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
um so this bill it says has been in
 
03:03:27.710 --> 03:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
committees ever since 2015. has there
 
03:03:29.690 --> 03:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
been harm in the fact that it hasn't
 
03:03:32.990 --> 03:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
been passed for almost eight years well
 
03:03:35.389 --> 03:03:35.399 align:start position:0%
I don't think this particular bill has
 
03:03:38.210 --> 03:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
been in committee since 2015 because I
 
03:03:40.790 --> 03:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
was working on alimony reform starting
 
03:03:44.510 --> 03:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
in 2015 and we had a number of
 
03:03:47.510 --> 03:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
iterations on alimony bills I had
 
03:03:50.330 --> 03:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
provided a couple of them the couple of
 
03:03:52.670 --> 03:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
the solutions that I had provided were
 
03:03:55.490 --> 03:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
later incorporated into what became the
 
03:03:59.030 --> 03:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
alimony Reform Act in 2019. so I don't
 
03:04:01.790 --> 03:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
recall this temporary uh thing being in
 
03:04:04.250 --> 03:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
there I can't specifically address what
 
03:04:07.309 --> 03:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:10.190 --> 03:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
03:04:12.469 --> 03:04:12.479 align:start position:0%
um according to this that they that they
 
03:04:14.870 --> 03:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
passed out now some sometimes it's gone
 
03:04:16.670 --> 03:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
over to committees
 
03:04:18.469 --> 03:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
um to study
 
03:04:20.510 --> 03:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not it was needed but
 
03:04:20.520 --> 03:04:21.889 align:start position:0%
whether or not it was needed but
regardless

03:04:21.889 --> 03:04:21.899 align:start position:0%
regardless
 
03:04:24.230 --> 03:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
um has there been harm
 
03:04:26.510 --> 03:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
in not passing it
 
03:04:29.690 --> 03:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
um well the answer is the answer is I've
 
03:04:32.030 --> 03:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
personally seen it yeah I've seen people
 
03:04:34.250 --> 03:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
get orders that they either couldn't pay
 
03:04:36.830 --> 03:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh our firm has seen orders that they
 
03:04:38.870 --> 03:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't pay and unfortunately it's
 
03:04:40.730 --> 03:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
subject to judicial discretion so
 
03:04:43.910 --> 03:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
they're largely unreviewable as long as
 
03:04:47.330 --> 03:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
there is a quote objective basis for the
 
03:04:49.250 --> 03:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
findings and rulings the courts make on
 
03:04:53.330 --> 03:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
appeal uh and personally is I'm I can
 
03:04:56.210 --> 03:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
only cite I'm I'm going to cite right
 
03:04:58.730 --> 03:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
now only one case that came out of the
 
03:05:02.150 --> 03:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
Nashua court that I had where the payee
 
03:05:03.710 --> 03:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
went in and made a number of
 
03:05:06.290 --> 03:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
representations as to what their income
 
03:05:06.300 --> 03:05:07.250 align:start position:0%
representations as to what their income
was

03:05:07.250 --> 03:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:05:11.690 --> 03:05:11.700 align:start position:0%
as to the exigency of circumstances that
 
03:05:14.389 --> 03:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
would have required an alimony order
 
03:05:16.370 --> 03:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
we had to go through the extensive
 
03:05:18.650 --> 03:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
Discovery process to find out that not
 
03:05:20.630 --> 03:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
only had this person perjured themselves
 
03:05:23.389 --> 03:05:23.399 align:start position:0%
that they had lied repeatedly under oath
 
03:05:26.269 --> 03:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
and on interrogatories had concealed
 
03:05:27.950 --> 03:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
information and ultimately the court
 
03:05:30.290 --> 03:05:30.300 align:start position:0%
made a referral to the county attorney's
 
03:05:33.349 --> 03:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
office now and this isn't the kind of
 
03:05:34.849 --> 03:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
thing that you would like to see on a
 
03:05:37.010 --> 03:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
regular basis that's only one glaring
 
03:05:40.730 --> 03:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
example uh uh so in other words so what
 
03:05:43.010 --> 03:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
is the harm that it prevents it it
 
03:05:46.130 --> 03:05:46.140 align:start position:0%
prevents a lot of harm and what it says
 
03:05:48.650 --> 03:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
is is that and it's just basically
 
03:05:51.710 --> 03:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
fairer to both parties now on the other
 
03:05:51.720 --> 03:05:52.550 align:start position:0%
fairer to both parties now on the other
side

03:05:52.550 --> 03:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
side
 
03:05:55.690 --> 03:05:55.700 align:start position:0%
if you've got immediate irreparable harm
 
03:05:59.630 --> 03:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
while you economic harm that is lead
 
03:06:00.889 --> 03:06:00.899 align:start position:0%
your case
 
03:06:04.130 --> 03:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
just argue bring us the facts and
 
03:06:06.410 --> 03:06:06.420 align:start position:0%
figures that say there should be a
 
03:06:08.210 --> 03:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
variance from this order
 
03:06:10.610 --> 03:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
or variance from this statute and if you
 
03:06:11.750 --> 03:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
can do that
 
03:06:13.550 --> 03:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
you know that's fine that's what courts
 
03:06:15.290 --> 03:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
are all about
 
03:06:17.650 --> 03:06:17.660 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
03:06:20.630 --> 03:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
03:06:23.929 --> 03:06:23.939 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman and thank you uh
 
03:06:28.190 --> 03:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about how this change would
 
03:06:31.190 --> 03:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
stop the situation that you gave as an
 
03:06:33.769 --> 03:06:33.779 align:start position:0%
example because I don't see how this
 
03:06:33.779 --> 03:06:35.990 align:start position:0%
example because I don't see how this
language

03:06:35.990 --> 03:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:06:37.550 --> 03:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
um would have stopped that particular
 
03:06:40.190 --> 03:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
individual from committing all of that
 
03:06:42.290 --> 03:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
fraud I mean it seems to me that we
 
03:06:44.929 --> 03:06:44.939 align:start position:0%
already have under
 
03:06:49.250 --> 03:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
um 458 19a for
 
03:06:51.830 --> 03:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
um an allowance for the court adjusting
 
03:06:53.750 --> 03:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
formula amounts
 
03:06:55.429 --> 03:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
um if the court requires that Justice
 
03:06:57.410 --> 03:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
requires an adjustment so I guess I'm
 
03:06:59.570 --> 03:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about how this would
 
03:07:02.330 --> 03:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
prohibit that example from happening it
 
03:07:04.690 --> 03:07:04.700 align:start position:0%
would cut down on it nothing is perfect
 
03:07:07.250 --> 03:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh but the point of it is is that when
 
03:07:10.070 --> 03:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
people see that uh I think there would
 
03:07:12.710 --> 03:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
be less likely to do it and there would
 
03:07:15.650 --> 03:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
be better Arguments for it and you know
 
03:07:18.710 --> 03:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
nothing is perfect this just cuts down
 
03:07:21.110 --> 03:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
on it and it also does something that
 
03:07:22.969 --> 03:07:22.979 align:start position:0%
the for the current statute doesn't do
 
03:07:26.330 --> 03:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
which is ADD predictability which is
 
03:07:29.090 --> 03:07:29.100 align:start position:0%
what it's supposed to do
 
03:07:31.849 --> 03:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
did I if I if if there if I haven't
 
03:07:34.790 --> 03:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
answered your question because
 
03:07:37.250 --> 03:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:07:41.750 --> 03:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:44.929 --> 03:07:44.939 align:start position:0%
no representative Bickford
 
03:07:47.450 --> 03:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair man
 
03:07:47.460 --> 03:07:48.530 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair man
um

03:07:48.530 --> 03:07:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:50.210 --> 03:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like the formula is too
 
03:07:50.220 --> 03:07:51.349 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like the formula is too
rigid

03:07:51.349 --> 03:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
rigid
 
03:07:53.630 --> 03:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
and confined and we need this to relief
 
03:07:56.510 --> 03:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
valve well what it does is that actually
 
03:07:59.450 --> 03:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
this actually adds predictability in
 
03:08:00.889 --> 03:08:00.899 align:start position:0%
other words the whole point of the
 
03:08:02.929 --> 03:08:02.939 align:start position:0%
alimony statute was to add
 
03:08:05.330 --> 03:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
predictability and to give all both
 
03:08:08.330 --> 03:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
parties in the courts guidelines and
 
03:08:10.429 --> 03:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
guidance from the legislature as to how
 
03:08:13.550 --> 03:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
the alimony statute ought to work
 
03:08:15.590 --> 03:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
um so what this does is that this
 
03:08:17.750 --> 03:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
corrects well I think is frankly an
 
03:08:20.690 --> 03:08:20.700 align:start position:0%
error in the statute and
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and says okay look this is what it is
 
03:08:26.690 --> 03:08:26.700 align:start position:0%
going in okay this is what you can
 
03:08:30.349 --> 03:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
expect now human nature being what it is
 
03:08:32.210 --> 03:08:32.220 align:start position:0%
in the human existence being what it is
 
03:08:35.150 --> 03:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
I go back to what I said before if you
 
03:08:37.670 --> 03:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
have some kind of immediate irreparable
 
03:08:39.469 --> 03:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
economic harm
 
03:08:41.330 --> 03:08:41.340 align:start position:0%
tell us what it is
 
03:08:44.210 --> 03:08:44.220 align:start position:0%
and uh and be prepared to verify it just
 
03:08:47.210 --> 03:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
don't make it as an offer of proof and
 
03:08:50.030 --> 03:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh offer of proof means your honor if my
 
03:08:51.710 --> 03:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
client were to testify this is what
 
03:08:54.769 --> 03:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
they'd say okay uh just bring it
 
03:08:56.570 --> 03:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
and then the court can have a basis to
 
03:08:59.690 --> 03:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
rule on as it is now you know the whole
 
03:09:01.730 --> 03:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
point of the alimony statute was to turn
 
03:09:04.370 --> 03:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
this from a wild west shoot amount into
 
03:09:05.929 --> 03:09:05.939 align:start position:0%
something that we would be able to have
 
03:09:08.809 --> 03:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
some order and be able to work from in
 
03:09:10.490 --> 03:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
guidance and I remember a number of the
 
03:09:12.710 --> 03:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
judges when these alimony statutes were
 
03:09:14.570 --> 03:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
being worked we're looking for guidance
 
03:09:16.790 --> 03:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
and thought it was a pretty good idea so
 
03:09:20.990 --> 03:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
that's where it goes thank you sure
 
03:09:23.330 --> 03:09:23.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
03:09:25.550 --> 03:09:25.560 align:start position:0%

and judges have made it known that the
 
03:10:32.030 --> 03:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
alimony process is not quite what it
 
03:10:35.330 --> 03:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
should be and this helps it along it's
 
03:10:39.590 --> 03:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
not a 100 percent fix but it gets it
 
03:10:39.600 --> 03:10:41.690 align:start position:0%
not a 100 percent fix but it gets it
forward

03:10:41.690 --> 03:10:41.700 align:start position:0%

and
 
03:11:59.330 --> 03:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
um I come today in opposition of this
 
03:12:02.450 --> 03:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
um change to the alimony law
 
03:12:05.389 --> 03:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
and there's a few reasons for that that
 
03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
I can speak to First is
 
03:12:11.630 --> 03:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
um I was part of what we called
 
03:12:14.929 --> 03:12:14.939 align:start position:0%
informally an alimony working group back
 
03:12:17.929 --> 03:12:17.939 align:start position:0%
in I think we assembled in the summer of
 
03:12:20.290 --> 03:12:20.300 align:start position:0%
2018 if I recall
 
03:12:23.450 --> 03:12:23.460 align:start position:0%
which was headed up by a woman named
 
03:12:25.550 --> 03:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
Honey Hastings who unfortunately has
 
03:12:27.710 --> 03:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
passed away
 
03:12:30.830 --> 03:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh she was really the leader of
 
03:12:33.590 --> 03:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
our group of a variety of different
 
03:12:35.929 --> 03:12:35.939 align:start position:0%
family law attorneys
 
03:12:40.670 --> 03:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
um mediators and others who help people
 
03:12:44.389 --> 03:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
with divorce law in New Hampshire
 
03:12:49.010 --> 03:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
and we really spent you know we did
 
03:12:50.990 --> 03:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
probably 10 different meetings over a
 
03:12:54.849 --> 03:12:54.859 align:start position:0%
summer to help draft what is currently
 
03:12:59.290 --> 03:12:59.300 align:start position:0%
the alimony law which is made up of RSA
 
03:13:07.250 --> 03:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
45819 and RSA 458 19 Dash lowercase a
 
03:13:09.590 --> 03:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
um the the purpose of that law was to
 
03:13:12.349 --> 03:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
establish a formula which is currently
 
03:13:14.690 --> 03:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
in place that was amended
 
03:13:16.670 --> 03:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
um slightly due to changes in federal
 
03:13:20.330 --> 03:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
tax law but that's been in place
 
03:13:20.340 --> 03:13:21.290 align:start position:0%
tax law but that's been in place
um

03:13:21.290 --> 03:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:25.010 --> 03:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
for the last couple of years and this
 
03:13:28.190 --> 03:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
change here would just change the
 
03:13:31.370 --> 03:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
definition of temporary alimony
 
03:13:31.380 --> 03:13:32.030 align:start position:0%
definition of temporary alimony
um

03:13:32.030 --> 03:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:35.150 --> 03:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
so the the difference is there's term
 
03:13:37.910 --> 03:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
alimony which is the alimony that would
 
03:13:40.490 --> 03:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
be put in place on a final basis after a
 
03:13:42.530 --> 03:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
final hearing and when a final decree is
 
03:13:45.230 --> 03:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
issued for the divorce
 
03:13:47.150 --> 03:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
um temporary alimony is what's put in
 
03:13:47.160 --> 03:13:48.469 align:start position:0%
um temporary alimony is what's put in
place

03:13:48.469 --> 03:13:48.479 align:start position:0%
place
 
03:13:51.650 --> 03:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
um while the divorce is still pending
 
03:13:54.170 --> 03:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
um in the court system
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
um temporary hearings are generally
 
03:13:59.269 --> 03:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
scheduled pretty early it's it if
 
03:14:01.010 --> 03:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
there's no mediation or if mediation
 
03:14:03.050 --> 03:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
fails the temporary hearing is what the
 
03:14:04.790 --> 03:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
court scheduled in order to put
 
03:14:07.250 --> 03:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
temporary orders in place like use in
 
03:14:09.190 --> 03:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
possession of a marital home
 
03:14:12.110 --> 03:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
payment of certain bills child support
 
03:14:14.630 --> 03:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
if there's children and things of that
 
03:14:14.640 --> 03:14:15.610 align:start position:0%
if there's children and things of that
nature

03:14:15.610 --> 03:14:15.620 align:start position:0%
nature
 
03:14:18.889 --> 03:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
and temporary orders are usually made
 
03:14:21.650 --> 03:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
before there's any been been any formal
 
03:14:23.530 --> 03:14:23.540 align:start position:0%
Discovery where people
 
03:14:26.330 --> 03:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
would be exchanging a number of
 
03:14:29.530 --> 03:14:29.540 align:start position:0%
documents about income and assets and
 
03:14:34.190 --> 03:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
ownership of various you know cars and
 
03:14:36.769 --> 03:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
real estate and all of the you know
 
03:14:38.990 --> 03:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
stocks and bonds and whatever other
 
03:14:43.010 --> 03:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
things that may be part of the marriage
 
03:14:43.020 --> 03:14:44.630 align:start position:0%
things that may be part of the marriage
and

03:14:44.630 --> 03:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:14:47.570 --> 03:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
um so often it would be very difficult
 
03:14:47.580 --> 03:14:48.769 align:start position:0%
um so often it would be very difficult
to

03:14:48.769 --> 03:14:48.779 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:14:48.779 --> 03:14:49.690 align:start position:0%
to
um

03:14:49.690 --> 03:14:49.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:53.090 --> 03:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
have a formula apply at that time
 
03:14:53.100 --> 03:14:55.070 align:start position:0%
have a formula apply at that time
because

03:14:55.070 --> 03:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:14:57.230 --> 03:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
um the formula is based on the two
 
03:15:02.150 --> 03:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
parties gross income and then it's 23 of
 
03:15:06.530 --> 03:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
that gross income and if there's other
 
03:15:08.929 --> 03:15:08.939 align:start position:0%
kinds of payments over property that
 
03:15:12.110 --> 03:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
hasn't been divided yet and people don't
 
03:15:14.349 --> 03:15:14.359 align:start position:0%
understand all of the
 
03:15:17.150 --> 03:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
value of all of those things and and
 
03:15:19.070 --> 03:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
what kinds of payments might need to be
 
03:15:19.080 --> 03:15:20.050 align:start position:0%
what kinds of payments might need to be
made

03:15:20.050 --> 03:15:20.060 align:start position:0%
made
 
03:15:23.630 --> 03:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
that formula could be confiscatory on
 
03:15:25.870 --> 03:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
one or the other party
 
03:15:30.469 --> 03:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
and therefore when we worked as a group
 
03:15:33.650 --> 03:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
of family law practitioners
 
03:15:36.230 --> 03:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
um you know thought about that and
 
03:15:36.240 --> 03:15:37.210 align:start position:0%
um you know thought about that and
really

03:15:37.210 --> 03:15:37.220 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:15:41.110 --> 03:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
knew that having the court to be able to
 
03:15:44.269 --> 03:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
not be bound by a formula at that time
 
03:15:46.690 --> 03:15:46.700 align:start position:0%
just didn't make sense because
 
03:15:49.910 --> 03:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately it needs to decide all of the
 
03:15:52.849 --> 03:15:52.859 align:start position:0%
other distribution of property and debt
 
03:15:52.859 --> 03:15:54.309 align:start position:0%
other distribution of property and debt
and

03:15:54.309 --> 03:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:15:57.530 --> 03:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
once it's able to do that then the the
 
03:16:01.550 --> 03:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
formula can apply because you assume
 
03:16:03.710 --> 03:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
that they've been able to you know
 
03:16:05.870 --> 03:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
figure out the disposition of all of
 
03:16:07.969 --> 03:16:07.979 align:start position:0%
those other things whereas it's really
 
03:16:10.070 --> 03:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
too early to do so at the temporary
 
03:16:10.080 --> 03:16:11.990 align:start position:0%
too early to do so at the temporary
stage

03:16:11.990 --> 03:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
stage
 
03:16:13.670 --> 03:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
and then I would just say that the way
 
03:16:16.670 --> 03:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
that this is written I've read it over a
 
03:16:19.730 --> 03:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
few different times I understand the
 
03:16:23.570 --> 03:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
purpose now having heard from Mr Markell
 
03:16:26.809 --> 03:16:26.819 align:start position:0%
um to explain that I'm not sure that the
 
03:16:28.990 --> 03:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
language that I'm reading actually
 
03:16:31.910 --> 03:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
accomplishes what it is
 
03:16:35.990 --> 03:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
um that I think uh the intent is for
 
03:16:38.450 --> 03:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
what I've just heard which is to have
 
03:16:40.370 --> 03:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
the formula be the default at the
 
03:16:42.170 --> 03:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
temporary stage
 
03:16:46.309 --> 03:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
um and and allow the judge to Veer off
 
03:16:48.230 --> 03:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
from that if there would be economic
 
03:16:50.510 --> 03:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
harm I mean that burden would be on the
 
03:16:53.630 --> 03:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
person who is the recipient of the
 
03:16:57.110 --> 03:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
alimony payment but this language here
 
03:16:57.120 --> 03:16:58.250 align:start position:0%
alimony payment but this language here
um

03:16:58.250 --> 03:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:01.490 --> 03:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
says such alimony shall not be subject
 
03:17:06.010 --> 03:17:06.020 align:start position:0%
to the duration limits under RSA
 
03:17:09.889 --> 03:17:09.899 align:start position:0%
45819-a and the formula limit under RSA
 
03:17:09.899 --> 03:17:11.769 align:start position:0%
45819-a and the formula limit under RSA
458

03:17:11.769 --> 03:17:11.779 align:start position:0%
458
 
03:17:16.370 --> 03:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
19-a2 unless and then then so it's
 
03:17:18.110 --> 03:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
saying it's not subject which is that
 
03:17:20.269 --> 03:17:20.279 align:start position:0%
that's the current law is that it's not
 
03:17:23.150 --> 03:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
subject to the the formula the duration
 
03:17:26.450 --> 03:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
limits and the formula limits currently
 
03:17:29.090 --> 03:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
that that's what the law says and then
 
03:17:32.389 --> 03:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
this says unless the person
 
03:17:35.389 --> 03:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
um who's seeking the temporary alimony
 
03:17:37.969 --> 03:17:37.979 align:start position:0%
um and the court finds that irreparable
 
03:17:40.070 --> 03:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
economic harm would result If the
 
03:17:42.830 --> 03:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
percentage formula were applied which
 
03:17:45.230 --> 03:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
presumes that it is being applied so
 
03:17:49.309 --> 03:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
it's it it's not the language If This
 
03:17:53.090 --> 03:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
Were passed it would confuse the courts
 
03:17:56.269 --> 03:17:56.279 align:start position:0%
it would confuse attorneys I'm confused
 
03:17:59.269 --> 03:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
by it so I'm not sure that
 
03:18:01.610 --> 03:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
the way it's written is accomplishing
 
03:18:04.550 --> 03:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing is the change which
 
03:18:07.070 --> 03:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
fundamentally I would argue is not the
 
03:18:08.809 --> 03:18:08.819 align:start position:0%
right change to make
 
03:18:12.110 --> 03:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:18.110 --> 03:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:19.910 --> 03:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you counselor thank
 
03:18:19.920 --> 03:18:24.530 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you counselor thank
you

03:18:24.530 --> 03:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:26.630 --> 03:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
the chair calls Vivian
 
03:18:30.290 --> 03:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:31.670 --> 03:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
I guess so
 
03:18:37.849 --> 03:18:37.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:41.630 --> 03:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:41.640 --> 03:18:42.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:18:42.469 --> 03:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:45.830 --> 03:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to voice my opinion on
 
03:18:48.410 --> 03:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
this because I was affected terribly by
 
03:18:51.710 --> 03:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
alimony during my divorce case as many
 
03:18:53.750 --> 03:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
of you know when you're dealing with
 
03:18:55.969 --> 03:18:55.979 align:start position:0%
divorce in alimony there's many factors
 
03:18:58.750 --> 03:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
that need to be looked at here
 
03:19:02.170 --> 03:19:02.180 align:start position:0%
in my case and this is all I can use
 
03:19:05.630 --> 03:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
here is in my case I had a child that
 
03:19:07.429 --> 03:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
had a disability
 
03:19:11.630 --> 03:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
I had left my employment after 15 years
 
03:19:14.210 --> 03:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
to raise my my daughter I was married
 
03:19:15.830 --> 03:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
for 19 years
 
03:19:19.670 --> 03:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
and based on our family I put my ex
 
03:19:21.230 --> 03:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
through school he got his engineering
 
03:19:21.240 --> 03:19:22.309 align:start position:0%
through school he got his engineering
degree

03:19:22.309 --> 03:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
degree
 
03:19:25.309 --> 03:19:25.319 align:start position:0%
and he made more money than I did and
 
03:19:26.750 --> 03:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
based on my daughter getting kicked out
 
03:19:29.510 --> 03:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
of school or preschools at three four
 
03:19:32.929 --> 03:19:32.939 align:start position:0%
years old we had to do something during
 
03:19:36.290 --> 03:19:36.300 align:start position:0%
our divorce not only did my employment
 
03:19:38.269 --> 03:19:38.279 align:start position:0%
suffer they told me I was underemployed
 
03:19:41.809 --> 03:19:41.819 align:start position:0%
even though we decided before we filed
 
03:19:44.150 --> 03:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
for divorce to start up a family-owned
 
03:19:44.160 --> 03:19:45.010 align:start position:0%
for divorce to start up a family-owned
business

03:19:45.010 --> 03:19:45.020 align:start position:0%
business
 
03:19:45.020 --> 03:19:46.550 align:start position:0%
business
and

03:19:46.550 --> 03:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:19:48.650 --> 03:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
um in order to
 
03:19:51.469 --> 03:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
file for divorce they did Issue me a
 
03:19:52.849 --> 03:19:52.859 align:start position:0%
temporary alimony
 
03:19:56.030 --> 03:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
but I feel that not all of the factors
 
03:19:57.769 --> 03:19:57.779 align:start position:0%
were looked at based on the current law
 
03:20:01.610 --> 03:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
so I agree with Mr Martel that a lot of
 
03:20:02.570 --> 03:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
this stuff
 
03:20:04.550 --> 03:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
um really needs to be looked at there
 
03:20:06.110 --> 03:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be a lot of housekeeping
 
03:20:09.410 --> 03:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
involved here and it really needs to be
 
03:20:11.570 --> 03:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
looked at based on the duration of the
 
03:20:11.580 --> 03:20:12.650 align:start position:0%
looked at based on the duration of the
marriage

03:20:12.650 --> 03:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
marriage
 
03:20:14.570 --> 03:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
what your factors are if you have a
 
03:20:16.309 --> 03:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
child a disability
 
03:20:20.450 --> 03:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
and in my case I decide what we as a
 
03:20:22.070 --> 03:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
couple decided that we were going to
 
03:20:23.870 --> 03:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
start up our own business at the house
 
03:20:26.450 --> 03:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
so I could remain employed have my own
 
03:20:29.750 --> 03:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
income base right after we we um
 
03:20:31.490 --> 03:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
purchased the property where I was going
 
03:20:33.710 --> 03:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
to perform my business
 
03:20:36.230 --> 03:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately my ex was not in the
 
03:20:39.050 --> 03:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
marriage anymore he decided to move on
 
03:20:42.110 --> 03:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
just because he decided to move on
 
03:20:44.870 --> 03:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
did not stop the opportunity that I
 
03:20:47.150 --> 03:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
started to get my business off the
 
03:20:47.160 --> 03:20:48.530 align:start position:0%
started to get my business off the
ground

03:20:48.530 --> 03:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
ground
 
03:20:51.410 --> 03:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
my parents have moved in I had my
 
03:20:53.030 --> 03:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
children in the school system
 
03:20:57.050 --> 03:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
my business started to really pick up
 
03:21:01.130 --> 03:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
and in order to keep the house I did
 
03:21:02.990 --> 03:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
need the alimony I did need child
 
03:21:05.870 --> 03:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
support and because of
 
03:21:09.769 --> 03:21:09.779 align:start position:0%
my situation on the judge used so much
 
03:21:12.530 --> 03:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
discretion and she found any way
 
03:21:15.110 --> 03:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
possible to vary from
 
03:21:17.870 --> 03:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
the law I think that we really need to
 
03:21:22.130 --> 03:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:24.769 --> 03:21:24.779 align:start position:0%
um Crossroads as to all right how long
 
03:21:26.090 --> 03:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
were you married for were you married
 
03:21:28.550 --> 03:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
over 10 years were you under 10 years do
 
03:21:30.590 --> 03:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
you have children how old are they do
 
03:21:32.510 --> 03:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
they have disability like you need to
 
03:21:34.849 --> 03:21:34.859 align:start position:0%
know more about a family rather than a
 
03:21:34.859 --> 03:21:35.929 align:start position:0%
know more about a family rather than a
judge

03:21:35.929 --> 03:21:35.939 align:start position:0%
judge
 
03:21:38.809 --> 03:21:38.819 align:start position:0%
ruling on your life not knowing any of
 
03:21:41.389 --> 03:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
the background any of the details and
 
03:21:43.429 --> 03:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
the fact that in my case I had a five
 
03:21:45.769 --> 03:21:45.779 align:start position:0%
and a seven-year-old child
 
03:21:47.630 --> 03:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
I lived in the marital house because
 
03:21:50.090 --> 03:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
that's where my business was if I gave
 
03:21:52.070 --> 03:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
up my house I would have been unemployed
 
03:21:53.870 --> 03:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
and living under a bridge in a cardboard
 
03:21:53.880 --> 03:21:54.769 align:start position:0%
and living under a bridge in a cardboard
box

03:21:54.769 --> 03:21:54.779 align:start position:0%
box
 
03:21:57.050 --> 03:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
what's the best way to do it here keep
 
03:21:58.910 --> 03:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
me in the house with the children and
 
03:22:00.710 --> 03:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
keep them in the school system for the
 
03:22:02.990 --> 03:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
benefit of the children or is it better
 
03:22:07.130 --> 03:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
to leave me homeless and unemployed
 
03:22:11.809 --> 03:22:11.819 align:start position:0%
and then to boot um the judge used again
 
03:22:14.269 --> 03:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
too much discussion I have a book about
 
03:22:16.309 --> 03:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
this thick
 
03:22:19.010 --> 03:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
um where she did not take the interest
 
03:22:21.050 --> 03:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
of the children in any way shape and
 
03:22:23.570 --> 03:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
form I lost all the property even the
 
03:22:25.610 --> 03:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
kids beds the bureaus and everything
 
03:22:25.620 --> 03:22:26.690 align:start position:0%
kids beds the bureaus and everything
else

03:22:26.690 --> 03:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
else
 
03:22:31.070 --> 03:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
I lost my 401k I lost everything so
 
03:22:34.429 --> 03:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
doing the the Equitable divisions are
 
03:22:36.889 --> 03:22:36.899 align:start position:0%
not working so if you have in my case
 
03:22:38.809 --> 03:22:38.819 align:start position:0%
would have been nice to have some kind
 
03:22:41.690 --> 03:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
of unemployment I'm sorry um uh alimony
 
03:22:43.730 --> 03:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
because I I wasn't eligible for
 
03:22:45.950 --> 03:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
unemployment I wasn't eligible for State
 
03:22:48.769 --> 03:22:48.779 align:start position:0%
services and it took so long for me to
 
03:22:51.050 --> 03:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
get into the system to Beyond Services
 
03:22:53.870 --> 03:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
which I should not have been if I was
 
03:22:56.570 --> 03:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
married to somebody that made 150 000 a
 
03:22:58.969 --> 03:22:58.979 align:start position:0%
year I should not be struggling to put
 
03:23:01.969 --> 03:23:01.979 align:start position:0%
food on my table pay my bills keep my
 
03:23:04.849 --> 03:23:04.859 align:start position:0%
children in their their doctor's
 
03:23:06.469 --> 03:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
appointments because I couldn't even
 
03:23:09.110 --> 03:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
afford the co-pays and the fact that
 
03:23:12.530 --> 03:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
there's so many different problems
 
03:23:15.590 --> 03:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
based on the court system in the in the
 
03:23:17.330 --> 03:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
deviations that they make you give them
 
03:23:19.429 --> 03:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
too much deviation they don't know which
 
03:23:21.590 --> 03:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
way to go they can make up any
 
03:23:23.389 --> 03:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
decision that they want and then you
 
03:23:27.110 --> 03:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
become a taxpayer burden so I guess I
 
03:23:28.550 --> 03:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that you guys
 
03:23:31.250 --> 03:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
understand that and and these type of
 
03:23:33.590 --> 03:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
systems if there's fault in
 
03:23:35.330 --> 03:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
on the breakdown of the marriage if
 
03:23:35.340 --> 03:23:36.170 align:start position:0%
on the breakdown of the marriage if
there's

03:23:36.170 --> 03:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:23:38.809 --> 03:23:38.819 align:start position:0%
unequal property Division if there's all
 
03:23:40.849 --> 03:23:40.859 align:start position:0%
these things that are going on within
 
03:23:42.590 --> 03:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
the court case you got to think about
 
03:23:44.389 --> 03:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
that parent that's trying to raise those
 
03:23:46.610 --> 03:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
children in that household
 
03:23:49.790 --> 03:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
so I I guess I would just look at the
 
03:23:52.849 --> 03:23:52.859 align:start position:0%
way that it's written and support that
 
03:23:54.710 --> 03:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
part of it are you willing to take
 
03:23:56.630 --> 03:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any from the
 
03:23:59.210 --> 03:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
committee absolutely are there any from
 
03:24:01.570 --> 03:24:01.580 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:24:04.130 --> 03:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your story it
 
03:24:06.410 --> 03:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
gives a personal
 
03:24:08.389 --> 03:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
note to
 
03:24:10.910 --> 03:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh our hearing today sorry I took my
 
03:24:12.710 --> 03:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
earbuds out because my phone is ringing
 
03:24:14.570 --> 03:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
that's quite all right and actually if
 
03:24:16.550 --> 03:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
people do want to read up on it more
 
03:24:19.429 --> 03:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
it's the Silva V Silva case thank you so
 
03:24:20.929 --> 03:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
03:24:23.389 --> 03:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
and I have no more pink cards that have
 
03:24:26.750 --> 03:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
been handed in so I will close the
 
03:24:31.150 --> 03:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 124
 
03:24:34.429 --> 03:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
my guess is that we're not ready to move
 
03:24:37.670 --> 03:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
forward on this we would like to ponder
 
03:24:41.630 --> 03:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
it for the next week or two or not so a
 
03:24:43.790 --> 03:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
straw poll how many of you would like to
 
03:24:48.530 --> 03:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:50.450 --> 03:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:24:54.110 --> 03:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
how many of you would like to wait
 
03:24:54.120 --> 03:24:56.210 align:start position:0%
how many of you would like to wait
that's

03:24:56.210 --> 03:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:25:03.190 --> 03:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:07.429 --> 03:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
and now where are we we are on open the
 
03:25:10.849 --> 03:25:10.859 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 85 the chair has
 
03:25:14.210 --> 03:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
flown in at no expense whatever uh
 
03:25:16.250 --> 03:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone from the front
 
03:25:18.650 --> 03:25:18.660 align:start position:0%
of the room to present her bill 85
 
03:25:27.010 --> 03:25:27.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:30.229 --> 03:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
anti-a-n-t-e meaning before not a n t i
 
03:25:34.849 --> 03:25:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:34.859 --> 03:25:53.630 align:start position:0%
 
85.

03:25:53.630 --> 03:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:55.729 --> 03:25:55.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:25:59.269 --> 03:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Deborah DeSimone
 
03:26:04.550 --> 03:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:06.889 --> 03:26:06.899 align:start position:0%
I brought this bill before you because
 
03:26:06.899 --> 03:26:08.929 align:start position:0%
I brought this bill before you because
uh

03:26:08.929 --> 03:26:08.939 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:26:11.030 --> 03:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
quite a while ago
 
03:26:14.450 --> 03:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
um we in this state
 
03:26:16.309 --> 03:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
started to allow
 
03:26:20.150 --> 03:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
same gender marriages
 
03:26:24.590 --> 03:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
but the law continued to say him her
 
03:26:27.410 --> 03:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
he she
 
03:26:30.349 --> 03:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
this bill brings for that I bring forth
 
03:26:33.469 --> 03:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
will change that to
 
03:26:36.530 --> 03:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
be more gender-neutral
 
03:26:39.349 --> 03:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
and that's what we need to do that's all
 
03:26:42.110 --> 03:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
it is it's a very simple housekeeping
 
03:26:42.120 --> 03:26:44.929 align:start position:0%
it is it's a very simple housekeeping
bill

03:26:44.929 --> 03:26:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:47.030 --> 03:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:26:48.469 --> 03:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
the last time I used the word
 
03:26:50.630 --> 03:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
housekeeping in committee 20 minutes
 
03:26:52.309 --> 03:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
later they rewrote the bill but I think
 
03:26:54.170 --> 03:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
you can get away on this one
 
03:26:57.590 --> 03:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
maybe so maybe no we'll see
 
03:26:59.450 --> 03:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
would you take questions absolutely
 
03:27:01.429 --> 03:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee if any it's
 
03:27:03.250 --> 03:27:03.260 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward yes
 
03:27:06.110 --> 03:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond I I apologize
 
03:27:08.330 --> 03:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
because I'm new do we have standard
 
03:27:10.250 --> 03:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
gender neutral language that the state
 
03:27:13.429 --> 03:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
has been using in bills thus far no okay
 
03:27:16.490 --> 03:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
do we have suggestions for dental
 
03:27:17.870 --> 03:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
nutrition is it just going to be they
 
03:27:17.880 --> 03:27:19.250 align:start position:0%
nutrition is it just going to be they
them

03:27:19.250 --> 03:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:27:22.070 --> 03:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
I believe that it states that in the
 
03:27:22.080 --> 03:27:23.510 align:start position:0%
I believe that it states that in the
bill

03:27:23.510 --> 03:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:27:25.790 --> 03:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
oh two people I apologize it would be
 
03:27:28.870 --> 03:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
two people okay as opposed to they them
 
03:27:31.610 --> 03:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
03:27:33.050 --> 03:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you those acronyms
 
03:27:33.060 --> 03:27:34.490 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you those acronyms
continually

03:27:34.490 --> 03:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
continually
 
03:27:36.769 --> 03:27:36.779 align:start position:0%
seem to change evolved yes
 
03:27:38.870 --> 03:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so I wanted to be neutral
 
03:27:41.330 --> 03:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative long
 
03:27:43.070 --> 03:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman

thank you Mr chairman
um

03:27:45.050 --> 03:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:47.510 --> 03:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
do you see an issue with adding the
 
03:27:50.690 --> 03:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
adult to adult people or would that be
 
03:27:50.700 --> 03:27:56.170 align:start position:0%
adult to adult people or would that be

marriages can take place at
 
03:28:09.469 --> 03:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the age of 16 who are they
 
03:28:10.849 --> 03:28:10.859 align:start position:0%

03:28:13.070 --> 03:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
you're right
 
03:28:16.550 --> 03:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
I at this time 16 year olds are not
 
03:28:16.560 --> 03:28:17.929 align:start position:0%
I at this time 16 year olds are not
adults

03:28:17.929 --> 03:28:17.939 align:start position:0%
adults
 
03:28:20.690 --> 03:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
so I at this time would prefer not to
 
03:28:23.809 --> 03:28:23.819 align:start position:0%
make that change at this time okay thank
 
03:28:30.769 --> 03:28:30.779 align:start position:0%

duration

03:28:47.330 --> 03:28:47.340 align:start position:0%

03:28:49.150 --> 03:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
um attorney Markel
 
03:28:52.070 --> 03:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:28:52.080 --> 03:28:53.510 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

03:28:53.510 --> 03:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:56.150 --> 03:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
it is I suppose I guess one would say a
 
03:28:57.550 --> 03:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Bill
 
03:29:01.010 --> 03:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
uh it needs to it simply needs to bring
 
03:29:02.990 --> 03:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
the statute the reason the language
 
03:29:05.870 --> 03:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
change is necessary is is that it simply
 
03:29:07.610 --> 03:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
needs to bring the statute up to date
 
03:29:09.650 --> 03:29:09.660 align:start position:0%
with the marriage laws as they exist in
 
03:29:12.349 --> 03:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
03:29:14.929 --> 03:29:14.939 align:start position:0%
um one of the questions was my initial
 
03:29:16.670 --> 03:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
involvement with this actually came
 
03:29:20.030 --> 03:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
quite by accident uh last year I was
 
03:29:22.490 --> 03:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
asked to do an opinion letter on the
 
03:29:24.530 --> 03:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
validity and enforceability of an
 
03:29:26.450 --> 03:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
antenuptial agreement for the state of
 
03:29:27.830 --> 03:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
South Carolina
 
03:29:30.650 --> 03:29:30.660 align:start position:0%
for a court for a litigant in a state in
 
03:29:32.410 --> 03:29:32.420 align:start position:0%
the state of South Carolina
 
03:29:37.070 --> 03:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
and in research and it's important
 
03:29:41.269 --> 03:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
because the anti-nuptial agreement by by
 
03:29:43.010 --> 03:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
the both parties said that in the event
 
03:29:45.530 --> 03:29:45.540 align:start position:0%
of a dispute the laws of New Hampshire
 
03:29:48.050 --> 03:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
shall control the outcome of any dispute
 
03:29:53.090 --> 03:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
arising in uh North Carolina in as a
 
03:29:55.309 --> 03:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
result of this antenopsial agreement
 
03:29:57.110 --> 03:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
so I looked at the statute and I
 
03:29:59.630 --> 03:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
realized I think it was created in 1981
 
03:30:03.110 --> 03:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
long before same-sex marriage became
 
03:30:05.450 --> 03:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
lawful in this state which it did by
 
03:30:07.610 --> 03:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
operation of law by passing the
 
03:30:09.830 --> 03:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate statutes which I think is we
 
03:30:12.410 --> 03:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
all know also became the law of the land
 
03:30:15.769 --> 03:30:15.779 align:start position:0%
in 2015 under the United States Supreme
 
03:30:15.779 --> 03:30:16.790 align:start position:0%
in 2015 under the United States Supreme
Court

03:30:16.790 --> 03:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
Court
 
03:30:18.410 --> 03:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
so I looked at the statute and I
 
03:30:19.969 --> 03:30:19.979 align:start position:0%
realized wait a minute there's a problem
 
03:30:21.830 --> 03:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
here because if it says a man and a
 
03:30:24.170 --> 03:30:24.180 align:start position:0%
woman now what happens if you have
 
03:30:26.990 --> 03:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
same-sex couples who are married and who
 
03:30:28.910 --> 03:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
are in the similar circumstance and it
 
03:30:31.130 --> 03:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
only says a man and a woman
 
03:30:33.349 --> 03:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
so then all of a sudden imagine the
 
03:30:35.570 --> 03:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
problem of South Carolina judge is going
 
03:30:38.510 --> 03:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
to have if all of a sudden the same
 
03:30:41.090 --> 03:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
thing comes up and you have two same-sex
 
03:30:43.130 --> 03:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
couples and they're going to have to
 
03:30:45.650 --> 03:30:45.660 align:start position:0%
interpret it under New Hampshire law and
 
03:30:47.090 --> 03:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
they're going to see wait a minute you
 
03:30:49.309 --> 03:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
guys you can't do it because you Bound
 
03:30:51.950 --> 03:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire law and New Hampshire
 
03:30:54.170 --> 03:30:54.180 align:start position:0%
law if you have two same-sex couples
 
03:30:56.150 --> 03:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
whatever the merits and whatever the
 
03:30:57.830 --> 03:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
outcome is going to be is going to be
 
03:31:00.290 --> 03:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
bound by the statute and since they have
 
03:31:02.210 --> 03:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
to give full faith and credit
 
03:31:04.790 --> 03:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
as a general proposition to another
 
03:31:06.590 --> 03:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
State's acts which is what New Hampshire
 
03:31:06.600 --> 03:31:07.670 align:start position:0%
State's acts which is what New Hampshire
does

03:31:07.670 --> 03:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:31:10.490 --> 03:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
okay with out of with antenuptial
 
03:31:12.769 --> 03:31:12.779 align:start position:0%
agreements it would only make sense that
 
03:31:14.690 --> 03:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
with a simple word change we bring the
 
03:31:16.849 --> 03:31:16.859 align:start position:0%
statute up to date and just say two
 
03:31:20.269 --> 03:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
persons and in for example with
 
03:31:22.370 --> 03:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
representative Long's position which no
 
03:31:25.429 --> 03:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
good point adult well once again you
 
03:31:27.889 --> 03:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
know it's two persons marry and so
 
03:31:30.290 --> 03:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
whatever the two persons are going to be
 
03:31:32.210 --> 03:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
it's going to depend on the laws of that
 
03:31:34.130 --> 03:31:34.140 align:start position:0%
state as to whether they can they can
 
03:31:36.889 --> 03:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
they can marry or not okay so that's how
 
03:31:39.229 --> 03:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
it more likely would be interpreted and
 
03:31:41.570 --> 03:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
that might be buttressed by the uniform
 
03:31:44.450 --> 03:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
marriage recognition act okay which
 
03:31:46.130 --> 03:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
which helps that if there's any
 
03:31:50.050 --> 03:31:50.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:52.490 --> 03:31:52.500 align:start position:0%

somebody else there's a different order
 
03:36:25.370 --> 03:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
but since this is her Amendment this is
 
03:36:28.370 --> 03:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
really the bill she'd like us to look at
 
03:36:31.190 --> 03:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
and you you told me over lunch that you
 
03:36:33.530 --> 03:36:33.540 align:start position:0%

03:36:36.349 --> 03:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
intent is
 
03:36:42.410 --> 03:36:42.420 align:start position:0%

03:37:39.899 --> 03:37:42.190 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:37:42.190 --> 03:37:42.200 align:start position:0%

to us okay thank you good afternoon
 
03:37:44.880 --> 03:37:46.030 align:start position:0%
to us okay thank you good afternoon
everyone

03:37:46.030 --> 03:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
03:37:48.830 --> 03:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
I'm Francis Nutter Upham
 
03:37:52.010 --> 03:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
I'm a psychotherapist I'm from Hillsboro
 
03:37:55.070 --> 03:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
8 which is Nashua
 
03:37:57.170 --> 03:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
um I've had experience working in
 
03:37:58.870 --> 03:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
private practice
 
03:38:02.710 --> 03:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
inpatient psychiatric hospitals
 
03:38:04.929 --> 03:38:04.939 align:start position:0%
Outreach clinics
 
03:38:07.370 --> 03:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
regular clinics where the clients come
 
03:38:09.590 --> 03:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
into your office
 
03:38:12.110 --> 03:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
um I have worked with some abused
 
03:38:14.630 --> 03:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
children over the years I've only been
 
03:38:17.530 --> 03:38:17.540 align:start position:0%
to court once with one of those children
 
03:38:20.929 --> 03:38:20.939 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at this from
 
03:38:24.229 --> 03:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
a therapist viewpoint but I realize you
 
03:38:26.929 --> 03:38:26.939 align:start position:0%
are child and family law
 
03:38:26.939 --> 03:38:28.670 align:start position:0%
are child and family law
so

03:38:28.670 --> 03:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:38:31.550 --> 03:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
um this bill
 
03:38:35.150 --> 03:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
likes the purpose of it is to give
 
03:38:37.610 --> 03:38:37.620 align:start position:0%
parents who have for some reason come
 
03:38:39.950 --> 03:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
before family courts
 
03:38:43.849 --> 03:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
and their child uh has shown some kind
 
03:38:45.950 --> 03:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
of signs that perhaps they need to be
 
03:38:45.960 --> 03:38:47.330 align:start position:0%
of signs that perhaps they need to be
evaluated

03:38:47.330 --> 03:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
evaluated
 
03:38:49.790 --> 03:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
that the parents
 
03:38:53.269 --> 03:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
have the choice to choose an evaluator
 
03:38:53.279 --> 03:38:55.269 align:start position:0%
have the choice to choose an evaluator
therapist

03:38:55.269 --> 03:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
therapist
 
03:38:58.429 --> 03:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
licensed person whatever under their own
 
03:39:00.790 --> 03:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
health insurance plan
 
03:39:03.769 --> 03:39:03.779 align:start position:0%
instead of there could be cases where
 
03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
the court just appointed
 
03:39:09.050 --> 03:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
a list of therapists that they had and
 
03:39:11.750 --> 03:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
the family had to pay out of pocket for
 
03:39:14.330 --> 03:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
that and I I don't know how expensive
 
03:39:17.410 --> 03:39:17.420 align:start position:0%
these evaluations could be but a regular
 
03:39:20.269 --> 03:39:20.279 align:start position:0%
therapy session is upwards of a hundred
 
03:39:22.550 --> 03:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
and fifty dollars and I think as
 
03:39:25.849 --> 03:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
legislators we're trying to fix problems
 
03:39:28.250 --> 03:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
and make things easier for our Citizens
 
03:39:31.610 --> 03:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
We're not trying to add
 
03:39:34.510 --> 03:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
ugly burden to a family that's already
 
03:39:37.450 --> 03:39:37.460 align:start position:0%
experiencing difficulties
 
03:39:39.590 --> 03:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
some of the other
 
03:39:43.190 --> 03:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
things that I learned about
 
03:39:47.030 --> 03:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
um who who appoints right now therapists
 
03:39:51.050 --> 03:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
or evaluators and I read that um
 
03:39:55.130 --> 03:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
Guardian ad litems gals
 
03:39:58.550 --> 03:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
who I thought naively were volunteer
 
03:40:02.090 --> 03:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
like Casa workers and they are not
 
03:40:02.100 --> 03:40:03.830 align:start position:0%
like Casa workers and they are not
apparently

03:40:03.830 --> 03:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
03:40:07.250 --> 03:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh they are paid for by one parent or
 
03:40:10.490 --> 03:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
the other and so I'm I
 
03:40:14.030 --> 03:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
calling into question perhaps the the
 
03:40:14.040 --> 03:40:15.469 align:start position:0%
calling into question perhaps the the
fairness

03:40:15.469 --> 03:40:15.479 align:start position:0%
fairness
 
03:40:18.490 --> 03:40:18.500 align:start position:0%
or their
 
03:40:21.050 --> 03:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
non-partiality of recommending a
 
03:40:23.870 --> 03:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
therapist I mean we all get comfortable
 
03:40:27.170 --> 03:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
with people we know but I think in this
 
03:40:30.650 --> 03:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
case I it's time to in empower the
 
03:40:34.309 --> 03:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
parents to be able to go to their ensure
 
03:40:37.070 --> 03:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
I mean if any of you have had um
 
03:40:39.170 --> 03:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
probably experience with picking you
 
03:40:42.530 --> 03:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
know medical doctors or counselors you
 
03:40:45.349 --> 03:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
call up your insurance or you go to your
 
03:40:48.469 --> 03:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
their website and you say you know who's
 
03:40:50.929 --> 03:40:50.939 align:start position:0%
an expert in bereavement who's an expert
 
03:40:53.150 --> 03:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
in whatever maybe you can look at their
 
03:40:56.210 --> 03:40:56.220 align:start position:0%
faces and and choose a counselor that
 
03:40:58.910 --> 03:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
way it's also
 
03:41:01.370 --> 03:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
I was thinking time and distant
 
03:41:04.130 --> 03:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
constraints in New Hampshire that if
 
03:41:06.710 --> 03:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
someone was appointed a counselor that
 
03:41:09.170 --> 03:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
was an hour and a half drive away one
 
03:41:11.630 --> 03:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
that was somebody in their town
 
03:41:13.490 --> 03:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
on their insurance plan that they could
 
03:41:17.750 --> 03:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
use that would be causing undue hardship
 
03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
so that's the gist of my bill it's just
 
03:41:25.490 --> 03:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
giving the parents the choice to use
 
03:41:27.969 --> 03:41:27.979 align:start position:0%
a counselor under their insurance plan
 
03:41:33.110 --> 03:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
and there's a Proviso that's added in
 
03:41:37.450 --> 03:41:37.460 align:start position:0%
um about if the parents can't agree
 
03:41:40.610 --> 03:41:40.620 align:start position:0%
to choose one that then the court would
 
03:41:41.630 --> 03:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
step in
 
03:41:43.670 --> 03:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
so I you know I
 
03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
I think some of us can't imagine how
 
03:41:49.269 --> 03:41:49.279 align:start position:0%
content contentious a divorce could be
 
03:41:51.290 --> 03:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
fortunately I haven't had to see too
 
03:41:54.290 --> 03:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
much of that but anyway so
 
03:41:57.349 --> 03:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
um that's the bill and I'd be happy to
 
03:41:59.929 --> 03:41:59.939 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
03:42:28.929 --> 03:42:28.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:32.929 --> 03:42:32.939 align:start position:0%
that was my hope but but then I realized
 
03:42:35.450 --> 03:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
that it could be just one parent paying
 
03:42:40.510 --> 03:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:44.030 --> 03:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you in a perfect world that's
 
03:42:46.729 --> 03:42:46.739 align:start position:0%
the deal okay thank you
 
03:42:50.330 --> 03:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:53.269 --> 03:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you she was born in Germany I know
 
03:42:55.790 --> 03:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
I won't ask my question in German
 
03:42:55.800 --> 03:42:56.990 align:start position:0%
I won't ask my question in German
um

03:42:56.990 --> 03:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:58.969 --> 03:42:58.979 align:start position:0%
I could only give you one or two word
 
03:43:01.330 --> 03:43:01.340 align:start position:0%
answer back in German
 
03:43:03.590 --> 03:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
so if
 
03:43:05.750 --> 03:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
just to confirm that if they do not
 
03:43:08.269 --> 03:43:08.279 align:start position:0%
agree if the two parties involved are
 
03:43:11.030 --> 03:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
not in agreement and then it's going
 
03:43:13.790 --> 03:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
back to the court to decide
 
03:43:16.370 --> 03:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
they do have the court will then have to
 
03:43:20.150 --> 03:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
pick someone yes in network yes thank
 
03:43:24.670 --> 03:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:24.680 --> 03:43:27.910 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:43:27.910 --> 03:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:30.170 --> 03:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
03:43:32.929 --> 03:43:32.939 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman so the current
 
03:43:35.330 --> 03:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
language says that
 
03:43:38.210 --> 03:43:38.220 align:start position:0%
um the court needs to
 
03:43:39.950 --> 03:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
um do
 
03:43:42.530 --> 03:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
um do consideration to finding one in
 
03:43:44.929 --> 03:43:44.939 align:start position:0%
network do we know that if there's a
 
03:43:47.389 --> 03:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
problem with finding providers in
 
03:43:49.550 --> 03:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
network I guess is my question and then
 
03:43:52.670 --> 03:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
the second part of the question is what
 
03:43:55.190 --> 03:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
about for those families who have New
 
03:43:56.870 --> 03:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Healthy Families or Medicaid
 
03:44:00.969 --> 03:44:00.979 align:start position:0%
for whom there is a significant lack of
 
03:44:03.410 --> 03:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
providers available right now
 
03:44:05.630 --> 03:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
that is an excellent question I don't
 
03:44:09.290 --> 03:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:11.210 --> 03:44:11.220 align:start position:0%
thank you I just know that of course
 
03:44:13.910 --> 03:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
some therapists will work on a sliding
 
03:44:18.950 --> 03:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
scale they'll take your income into uh
 
03:44:21.110 --> 03:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know they'll take a look at it and
 
03:44:23.150 --> 03:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
decide that well okay you could pay
 
03:44:25.250 --> 03:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars for a session instead of
 
03:44:29.809 --> 03:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
the usual 150. so I think with with this
 
03:44:32.929 --> 03:44:32.939 align:start position:0%
bill this way if a family didn't have an
 
03:44:32.939 --> 03:44:34.070 align:start position:0%
bill this way if a family didn't have an
insurance

03:44:34.070 --> 03:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:44:36.469 --> 03:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
but but that is something maybe you guys
 
03:44:38.750 --> 03:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
can figure out how to add on to this to
 
03:44:40.429 --> 03:44:40.439 align:start position:0%
have people covered who don't have
 
03:44:42.530 --> 03:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
insurance but at least this would give
 
03:44:42.540 --> 03:44:44.389 align:start position:0%
insurance but at least this would give
someone

03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
someone
 
03:44:46.309 --> 03:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
um the opening to try and find someone
 
03:44:49.130 --> 03:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
who would work for a sliding scale in a
 
03:44:50.809 --> 03:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
in a more affordable
 
03:44:52.670 --> 03:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you therapy session thank you
 
03:44:55.370 --> 03:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:57.469 --> 03:44:57.479 align:start position:0%
representative do you think that we
 
03:44:59.030 --> 03:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
should uh
 
03:45:02.769 --> 03:45:02.779 align:start position:0%
perhaps put language in your Amendment
 
03:45:06.550 --> 03:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
regarding what would happen if the
 
03:45:09.229 --> 03:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
parents have no insurance or there was
 
03:45:12.950 --> 03:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
no one in network because I I could see
 
03:45:15.769 --> 03:45:15.779 align:start position:0%
in a restrictive way the court shall
 
03:45:18.710 --> 03:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
choose a participating provider in the
 
03:45:21.370 --> 03:45:21.380 align:start position:0%
party's health insurance carrier Network
 
03:45:24.170 --> 03:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
begs the question that the parents have
 
03:45:28.030 --> 03:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
that so how is the court now instructed
 
03:45:32.510 --> 03:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
if uh there's no one in network or if
 
03:45:35.450 --> 03:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
the parents do not have insurance I I
 
03:45:39.469 --> 03:45:39.479 align:start position:0%
would want that in here somewhere I
 
03:45:40.969 --> 03:45:40.979 align:start position:0%
think that would be an excellent
 
03:45:44.090 --> 03:45:44.100 align:start position:0%
addition to this and I don't know and
 
03:45:47.210 --> 03:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if anyone here knows what
 
03:45:50.150 --> 03:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
does the court currently do when someone
 
03:45:53.030 --> 03:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
has no insurance
 
03:45:53.040 --> 03:45:55.490 align:start position:0%
has no insurance
well

03:45:55.490 --> 03:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:45:59.229 --> 03:45:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:02.030 --> 03:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
I don't have that it was a Christmas
 
03:46:05.450 --> 03:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:09.950 --> 03:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:13.250 --> 03:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
um my suggestion would be before we exec
 
03:46:15.889 --> 03:46:15.899 align:start position:0%
this bill you could find out from those
 
03:46:20.090 --> 03:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
who know it and perhaps when we do go to
 
03:46:23.150 --> 03:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
execut there'd be an amendment in
 
03:46:25.670 --> 03:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
instead of 200 that we could consider
 
03:46:29.090 --> 03:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
yes I would be happy to do that okay uh
 
03:46:31.250 --> 03:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
03:46:34.010 --> 03:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my question is
 
03:46:37.309 --> 03:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
what happened in one of the parents I
 
03:46:41.570 --> 03:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
don't agree it has restrainted order
 
03:46:41.580 --> 03:46:43.870 align:start position:0%
don't agree it has restrainted order
foreign

03:46:43.870 --> 03:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:47.570 --> 03:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
again I'm familiar with the therapy side
 
03:46:49.790 --> 03:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
of things so
 
03:46:49.800 --> 03:46:52.190 align:start position:0%
of things so
the

03:46:52.190 --> 03:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:46:55.330 --> 03:46:55.340 align:start position:0%
what do you mean that exactly um because
 
03:46:58.309 --> 03:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes I mean the child can't see
 
03:47:00.170 --> 03:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
this parent because of the restraining
 
03:47:02.870 --> 03:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
order oh you know they can agree with
 
03:47:05.510 --> 03:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know what therapists or who's paying
 
03:47:08.630 --> 03:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
for a whole second uh
 
03:47:08.640 --> 03:47:10.790 align:start position:0%
for a whole second uh
um

03:47:10.790 --> 03:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:12.349 --> 03:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
who's going to make the decision about
 
03:47:14.150 --> 03:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
the therapist because it's a restraining
 
03:47:15.950 --> 03:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
order but that pairing is the one who's
 
03:47:17.630 --> 03:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
paying or the the other parent cannot
 
03:47:20.809 --> 03:47:20.819 align:start position:0%
afford it how did that gonna work well I
 
03:47:25.010 --> 03:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
think um with the Proviso if there's a a
 
03:47:28.190 --> 03:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
sorry I gotta find the line
 
03:47:32.389 --> 03:47:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:35.510 --> 03:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh in the event that abuse has been made
 
03:47:37.670 --> 03:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
and I would assume that if we have a
 
03:47:39.229 --> 03:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
restraining order that would sort of
 
03:47:40.729 --> 03:47:40.739 align:start position:0%
imply that
 
03:47:42.769 --> 03:47:42.779 align:start position:0%
um that then the court would decide
 
03:47:46.849 --> 03:47:46.859 align:start position:0%
so okay it's probably hard to
 
03:47:48.889 --> 03:47:48.899 align:start position:0%
put wording in for every possible
 
03:47:52.010 --> 03:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
scenario but I think that Loosely covers
 
03:47:52.020 --> 03:47:53.210 align:start position:0%
scenario but I think that Loosely covers
that

03:47:53.210 --> 03:47:53.220 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:47:55.190 --> 03:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
03:47:58.490 --> 03:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
representative representative Moulton
 
03:48:01.070 --> 03:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um just to comment
 
03:48:04.010 --> 03:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
on what representative Perez was saying
 
03:48:06.590 --> 03:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
there's usually language in there that
 
03:48:09.250 --> 03:48:09.260 align:start position:0%
says who is going to make the
 
03:48:12.769 --> 03:48:12.779 align:start position:0%
decisions about medical
 
03:48:15.830 --> 03:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
um in the in the temporary orders or in
 
03:48:19.190 --> 03:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
the the divorce decree uh in the event
 
03:48:20.750 --> 03:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
that there's a restraining order and
 
03:48:22.849 --> 03:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
somebody else can't
 
03:48:26.809 --> 03:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:26.819 --> 03:48:28.190 align:start position:0%
 
speaking

03:48:28.190 --> 03:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
03:48:30.110 --> 03:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
as a therapist
 
03:48:32.690 --> 03:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
now you've got to go talk to the lawyers
 
03:48:36.290 --> 03:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
yes not to cancel out your good work
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
here as a therapist but just to make
 
03:48:40.370 --> 03:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
sure that the court understands and
 
03:48:42.530 --> 03:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't find themselves in a conundrum
 
03:48:45.650 --> 03:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
yes I I think that the coverage what do
 
03:48:47.990 --> 03:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
we do with people without insurance
 
03:48:50.809 --> 03:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
which someday I hope we never have to
 
03:48:54.710 --> 03:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
say unless and until yeah and also those
 
03:48:56.750 --> 03:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
those cases where the parents may be
 
03:49:00.590 --> 03:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
unable to agree because one of them has
 
03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
by court order been put out of the
 
03:49:02.880 --> 03:49:03.830 align:start position:0%
by court order been put out of the
picture

03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
picture
 
03:49:05.990 --> 03:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know I'd run this I'd run this by a
 
03:49:07.550 --> 03:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
lawyer or two to see what they come up
 
03:49:09.650 --> 03:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
with okay because it's a good bill yeah
 
03:49:12.410 --> 03:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome anybody else Mr
 
03:49:14.389 --> 03:49:14.399 align:start position:0%

I'll get back to you before you schedule
 
03:49:20.510 --> 03:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
an exec yes think about the 24th
 
03:49:21.420 --> 03:49:21.430 align:start position:0%
this is a month
 
03:49:21.430 --> 03:49:23.450 align:start position:0%
this is a month
[Laughter]

03:49:23.450 --> 03:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:49:26.630 --> 03:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:30.710 --> 03:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
a few people um who want to uh speak to
 
03:49:33.469 --> 03:49:33.479 align:start position:0%
this bill and uh put you in the front
 
03:49:34.910 --> 03:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
row there as an expert in case you're
 
03:49:36.290 --> 03:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
the one that can answer the question
 
03:49:37.969 --> 03:49:37.979 align:start position:0%
that they raise thank you very much
 
03:49:40.490 --> 03:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
you're welcome glad you're here
 
03:49:45.410 --> 03:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
chair calls I believe it's Dana Albrecht
 
03:49:48.050 --> 03:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
did I get the name right
 
03:49:50.630 --> 03:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh Dana Albrecht for the record
 
03:49:52.729 --> 03:49:52.739 align:start position:0%
and rep Grossman can probably pronounce
 
03:49:58.010 --> 03:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:00.290 --> 03:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
so for the record uh Dana Albrecht
 
03:50:01.809 --> 03:50:01.819 align:start position:0%
Nashua New Hampshire
 
03:50:04.490 --> 03:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
uh I'm the father of four wonderful
 
03:50:04.500 --> 03:50:05.830 align:start position:0%
uh I'm the father of four wonderful
children

03:50:05.830 --> 03:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:50:09.349 --> 03:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh first uh very brief background on my
 
03:50:12.110 --> 03:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
own case and then uh three points in
 
03:50:13.849 --> 03:50:13.859 align:start position:0%
support of the bill
 
03:50:17.330 --> 03:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
uh also is a preliminary matter if I
 
03:50:19.910 --> 03:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
could respectfully request the chair to
 
03:50:22.010 --> 03:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
tell us the name and title of your
 
03:50:23.929 --> 03:50:23.939 align:start position:0%
Christmas present
 
03:50:26.510 --> 03:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire juvenile laws was one of
 
03:50:26.520 --> 03:50:27.349 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire juvenile laws was one of
them

03:50:27.349 --> 03:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:50:29.450 --> 03:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
the other one was law Essentials of
 
03:50:33.110 --> 03:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
family law and it has a practice LSAT
 
03:50:35.809 --> 03:50:35.819 align:start position:0%
test in there which I aced so now I'm
 
03:50:38.269 --> 03:50:38.279 align:start position:0%
being sent uh things from law schools
 
03:50:40.750 --> 03:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
asking me to apply in my spare time
 
03:50:43.190 --> 03:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
perfect uh we could all come on up and
 
03:50:45.170 --> 03:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
take a look at it afterwards yeah yeah
 
03:50:45.180 --> 03:50:47.410 align:start position:0%
take a look at it afterwards yeah yeah
great

03:50:47.410 --> 03:50:47.420 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:50:50.690 --> 03:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
uh so by way background I've had my
 
03:50:52.849 --> 03:50:52.859 align:start position:0%
adventures in the New Hampshire judicial
 
03:50:54.769 --> 03:50:54.779 align:start position:0%
branch some of you might have read about
 
03:50:58.309 --> 03:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
those in the union leader uh but uh I
 
03:51:02.090 --> 03:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
have a multi-state uh uh
 
03:51:04.990 --> 03:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
diversity of citizenship case
 
03:51:08.929 --> 03:51:08.939 align:start position:0%
uh where New Hampshire has decided over
 
03:51:11.510 --> 03:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
the uh objection of both parties that
 
03:51:13.750 --> 03:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
Michigan should now have jurisdiction
 
03:51:16.309 --> 03:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
concerning court orders that require
 
03:51:19.250 --> 03:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
counseling occur in California and
 
03:51:22.910 --> 03:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
nobody lives in California so we're
 
03:51:25.870 --> 03:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
having fun dealing with that right now
 
03:51:29.570 --> 03:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
uh but moving on to the bill
 
03:51:33.530 --> 03:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
uh sort of three points in support
 
03:51:35.469 --> 03:51:35.479 align:start position:0%
uh first off
 
03:51:39.170 --> 03:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh without getting into the weeds
 
03:51:42.889 --> 03:51:42.899 align:start position:0%
uh I think we have a crisis in the
 
03:51:44.929 --> 03:51:44.939 align:start position:0%
judicial branch right now
 
03:51:47.870 --> 03:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
uh we've had a number of outgoing uh
 
03:51:50.150 --> 03:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
judicial officers under leave under
 
03:51:55.130 --> 03:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
judicial misconduct and we've had a
 
03:51:59.050 --> 03:51:59.060 align:start position:0%
whole lot more uh incoming and
 
03:52:02.990 --> 03:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:03.000 --> 03:52:04.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:52:04.150 --> 03:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:07.849 --> 03:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
and I understand we've even gotten to
 
03:52:10.010 --> 03:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
where we're closing the judicial branch
 
03:52:12.710 --> 03:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh twice a month for two hours
 
03:52:15.650 --> 03:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
a day uh in the morning to do in-service
 
03:52:18.889 --> 03:52:18.899 align:start position:0%
training so again you know lots of new
 
03:52:20.630 --> 03:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
incoming people anything we can do to
 
03:52:24.050 --> 03:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
help them out I think would be a good
 
03:52:27.229 --> 03:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
thing and I think this uh bill would do
 
03:52:27.239 --> 03:52:28.790 align:start position:0%
thing and I think this uh bill would do
that

03:52:28.790 --> 03:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:52:31.910 --> 03:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh so that's sort of Point number one
 
03:52:31.920 --> 03:52:33.410 align:start position:0%
uh so that's sort of Point number one
uh

03:52:33.410 --> 03:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:52:35.929 --> 03:52:35.939 align:start position:0%
Point number two
 
03:52:35.939 --> 03:52:37.790 align:start position:0%
Point number two
uh

03:52:37.790 --> 03:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:52:42.309 --> 03:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
is I think this bill uh
 
03:52:45.590 --> 03:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
furthers the provisions of our state
 
03:52:45.600 --> 03:52:47.450 align:start position:0%
furthers the provisions of our state
constitution

03:52:47.450 --> 03:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
03:52:47.460 --> 03:52:49.670 align:start position:0%
constitution
uh

03:52:49.670 --> 03:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:52:49.680 --> 03:52:51.229 align:start position:0%
uh
so

03:52:51.229 --> 03:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know a lot of the stuff in the
 
03:52:55.790 --> 03:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
constitution is short and sweet and then
 
03:52:59.809 --> 03:52:59.819 align:start position:0%
you expound upon that in statute and
 
03:53:01.790 --> 03:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully that all comports and I think
 
03:53:05.150 --> 03:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
it does here and especially when you
 
03:53:08.090 --> 03:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
know judges have a little more detail in
 
03:53:11.110 --> 03:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
statute uh that certainly helps them out
 
03:53:15.110 --> 03:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
but uh in particular uh parenting rights
 
03:53:17.870 --> 03:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
are protected under article two of the
 
03:53:20.590 --> 03:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
state constitution
 
03:53:23.330 --> 03:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh and so
 
03:53:26.750 --> 03:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh if you look at the text you know on
 
03:53:29.389 --> 03:53:29.399 align:start position:0%
the one hand the language bold in
 
03:53:30.830 --> 03:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
section three
 
03:53:33.110 --> 03:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know parents have a right to choose
 
03:53:35.809 --> 03:53:35.819 align:start position:0%
a counselor on the one hand I think they
 
03:53:37.429 --> 03:53:37.439 align:start position:0%
already do pursue into the state
 
03:53:40.610 --> 03:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
constitution on the other hand you know
 
03:53:42.110 --> 03:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's going to be hard for a judge to
 
03:53:45.290 --> 03:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
figure out so let's just put it in the
 
03:53:47.150 --> 03:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
statute where it's nice and clean and
 
03:53:47.160 --> 03:53:51.170 align:start position:0%
statute where it's nice and clean and
unambiguous

03:53:51.170 --> 03:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:51.180 --> 03:53:52.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:53:52.190 --> 03:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:58.610 --> 03:53:58.620 align:start position:0%
I think uh this also sort of goes toward
 
03:53:58.620 --> 03:54:00.429 align:start position:0%
I think uh this also sort of goes toward
um

03:54:00.429 --> 03:54:00.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:02.870 --> 03:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
furthering what's been called the spirit
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
of equality that pervades the entire
 
03:54:07.190 --> 03:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
state constitution
 
03:54:11.330 --> 03:54:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh again you know therapist before going
 
03:54:13.550 --> 03:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
to the lawyers now
 
03:54:16.429 --> 03:54:16.439 align:start position:0%
uh but I think we have a disparity of
 
03:54:16.439 --> 03:54:17.750 align:start position:0%
uh but I think we have a disparity of
outcome

03:54:17.750 --> 03:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
03:54:21.110 --> 03:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh across the state in various family
 
03:54:25.010 --> 03:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
court cases you might get the I mean
 
03:54:26.210 --> 03:54:26.220 align:start position:0%
it's kind of the luck on the draw
 
03:54:28.490 --> 03:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
depending on which court you wind up in
 
03:54:32.809 --> 03:54:32.819 align:start position:0%
which judge you get uh just a lot of
 
03:54:34.370 --> 03:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
variables there
 
03:54:38.349 --> 03:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
and if you have a little more detail
 
03:54:42.710 --> 03:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
written into the statute of you know how
 
03:54:44.630 --> 03:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
a judge particularly a new and
 
03:54:46.189 --> 03:54:46.199 align:start position:0%
experienced one
 
03:54:49.130 --> 03:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh is supposed to handle something then
 
03:54:53.150 --> 03:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
I think that can be helpful
 
03:54:53.160 --> 03:54:54.370 align:start position:0%
I think that can be helpful
um

03:54:54.370 --> 03:54:54.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:57.889 --> 03:54:57.899 align:start position:0%
so I think again
 
03:55:01.070 --> 03:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh if you go back historically there's a
 
03:55:03.530 --> 03:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
sort of an ancient uh Supreme Court
 
03:55:06.950 --> 03:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
opinion that's still cited today which
 
03:55:13.070 --> 03:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
is a state V Pinoy or 65 NH 113 from
 
03:55:13.080 --> 03:55:15.050 align:start position:0%
is a state V Pinoy or 65 NH 113 from
1889.

03:55:15.050 --> 03:55:15.060 align:start position:0%
1889.
 
03:55:17.269 --> 03:55:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh but it's one of those Classics that
 
03:55:19.370 --> 03:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
people still keep citing so most
 
03:55:22.750 --> 03:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
recently uh an opinion of the justices
 
03:55:26.530 --> 03:55:26.540 align:start position:0%
uh 144 nh374
 
03:55:30.550 --> 03:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
1999 and Vermont also deferred to that
 
03:55:33.950 --> 03:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh for equal protection Provisions in
 
03:55:37.250 --> 03:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
marriage but bottom line is it talks
 
03:55:40.130 --> 03:55:40.140 align:start position:0%
about a spirit of equality that pervades
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
the State Constitution and back then it
 
03:55:46.070 --> 03:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
was about having sort of different
 
03:55:48.410 --> 03:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
outcomes in different areas of the state
 
03:55:51.110 --> 03:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
and we're going to ask you to kind of
 
03:55:53.210 --> 03:55:53.220 align:start position:0%
wrap it up because we've got some folks
 
03:55:56.630 --> 03:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
before you okay excuse me uh I think I'm
 
03:55:59.870 --> 03:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
actually done mostly so just coming back
 
03:56:02.830 --> 03:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
to that is
 
03:56:06.650 --> 03:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
what I think this goes to address is a
 
03:56:07.849 --> 03:56:07.859 align:start position:0%
lack of
 
03:56:10.010 --> 03:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
quality throughout the states and
 
03:56:11.929 --> 03:56:11.939 align:start position:0%
disparity of outcomes
 
03:56:15.170 --> 03:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
and that we're seeing now that's sort of
 
03:56:17.090 --> 03:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
In conflict with
 
03:56:19.790 --> 03:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
you know case law and why not fix it at
 
03:56:21.710 --> 03:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
the trial court instead of litigated all
 
03:56:23.689 --> 03:56:23.699 align:start position:0%
the way up you know the Appellate food
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
chain and with that uh any questions do
 
03:56:29.510 --> 03:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
we have any questions
 
03:56:32.689 --> 03:56:32.699 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:56:35.510 --> 03:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair the chair recognizes
 
03:56:41.090 --> 03:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:43.969 --> 03:56:43.979 align:start position:0%
hey we are trying to become multilingual
 
03:56:46.670 --> 03:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
in this committee Good Start thank you
 
03:56:47.950 --> 03:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
sir welcome
 
03:56:50.570 --> 03:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everybody uh thank you
 
03:56:52.849 --> 03:56:52.859 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak today uh my
 
03:56:54.410 --> 03:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
name is Sebastian Fuentes I'm the
 
03:56:55.729 --> 03:56:55.739 align:start position:0%
movement politics director for our
 
03:56:57.530 --> 03:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
organization called rights and democracy
 
03:56:59.630 --> 03:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
uh but I'm here to speak in a capacity
 
03:57:01.610 --> 03:57:01.620 align:start position:0%
of a parent that had to deal with with
 
03:57:04.550 --> 03:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
this exact issue a few years ago
 
03:57:07.010 --> 03:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
um we went to a divorce about about
 
03:57:10.490 --> 03:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
eight years now ago and um you know it's
 
03:57:13.130 --> 03:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
trying to as you know when you go
 
03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
through a divorce is it can be a bumpy
 
03:57:17.510 --> 03:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
Rocky situation and sometimes kind of
 
03:57:19.309 --> 03:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
dangerous for for either parent or the
 
03:57:19.319 --> 03:57:20.269 align:start position:0%
dangerous for for either parent or the
child

03:57:20.269 --> 03:57:20.279 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:57:22.610 --> 03:57:22.620 align:start position:0%
um at that point uh the the court at
 
03:57:24.710 --> 03:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
that time uh appointed me of letting
 
03:57:26.990 --> 03:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
that light him that I had no idea who
 
03:57:28.969 --> 03:57:28.979 align:start position:0%
that was uh
 
03:57:31.130 --> 03:57:31.140 align:start position:0%
no the mother of my daughter uh didn't
 
03:57:32.990 --> 03:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
know who that was as well uh we have to
 
03:57:34.670 --> 03:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
come out with money we kind of were
 
03:57:36.590 --> 03:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
forced to pay a specific amount of money
 
03:57:37.910 --> 03:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
it was about a thousand dollars at the
 
03:57:39.469 --> 03:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
time but as you know when you go through
 
03:57:41.150 --> 03:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
a divorce
 
03:57:42.530 --> 03:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
um everything changes your financial
 
03:57:44.750 --> 03:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
situation changes your living status
 
03:57:47.929 --> 03:57:47.939 align:start position:0%
changes so uh it becomes a problem so at
 
03:57:49.490 --> 03:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
that time I have to sell some of my
 
03:57:51.170 --> 03:57:51.180 align:start position:0%
belongings to be able to pay for that
 
03:57:53.570 --> 03:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
Garden online in my half of the of the
 
03:57:56.689 --> 03:57:56.699 align:start position:0%
amount so um I wish I wish this piece of
 
03:57:58.550 --> 03:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
legislation was was a law back then
 
03:58:00.590 --> 03:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
because it would help me be able to find
 
03:58:02.750 --> 03:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
somebody more affordable uh somebody
 
03:58:05.450 --> 03:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
that uh local close to the community
 
03:58:07.370 --> 03:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
where I was living because you know
 
03:58:09.170 --> 03:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
living in a North Country there's not
 
03:58:11.210 --> 03:58:11.220 align:start position:0%
that many uh so it was it was it made it
 
03:58:13.250 --> 03:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
hard for us to to be able to to get to
 
03:58:15.290 --> 03:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
that process and because I didn't have
 
03:58:16.969 --> 03:58:16.979 align:start position:0%
the money at the time uh you know I have
 
03:58:18.950 --> 03:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
to delay the process a little bit so the
 
03:58:20.809 --> 03:58:20.819 align:start position:0%
the you know the the printing coming out
 
03:58:22.490 --> 03:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
with a printing plan and the divorce
 
03:58:24.110 --> 03:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
settlement everything it took a little
 
03:58:25.849 --> 03:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
bit longer just because we didn't have
 
03:58:27.410 --> 03:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
the means the financial means to pay for
 
03:58:29.210 --> 03:58:29.220 align:start position:0%
that I don't know item so I'm just here
 
03:58:31.189 --> 03:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
to uh you know to speak on support of
 
03:58:32.630 --> 03:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
this bill so hopefully you guys will
 
03:58:34.309 --> 03:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
consider it thank you
 
03:58:38.530 --> 03:58:38.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:42.309 --> 03:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
Senora Perez in Spanish or English
 
03:58:45.110 --> 03:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna do both here we go with
 
03:58:48.349 --> 03:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:58.309 --> 03:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:58.319 --> 03:59:08.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:59:08.950 --> 03:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:12.469 --> 03:59:12.479 align:start position:0%
I'm asking if he believed that these
 
03:59:14.689 --> 03:59:14.699 align:start position:0%
legislation would help him at that point
 
03:59:17.389 --> 03:59:17.399 align:start position:0%
that he had a hard time monetary a hard
 
03:59:20.030 --> 03:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
time and the parents would benefit with
 
03:59:22.130 --> 03:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
this bill will pass
 
03:59:25.309 --> 03:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely yes see see uh no
 
03:59:26.450 --> 03:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
absolutely that would have helped me
 
03:59:28.429 --> 03:59:28.439 align:start position:0%
tremendously back then and not just me
 
03:59:30.530 --> 03:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
you know it will help also the mother of
 
03:59:31.969 --> 03:59:31.979 align:start position:0%
my daughter as well trying to be fair
 
03:59:33.410 --> 03:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
here in the discussion you know both
 
03:59:34.729 --> 03:59:34.739 align:start position:0%
both sides
 
03:59:36.530 --> 03:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
we need the assistance and that's just
 
03:59:38.809 --> 03:59:38.819 align:start position:0%
my reality I know that's the reality of
 
03:59:42.110 --> 03:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
many many Granite theaters
 
03:59:44.809 --> 03:59:44.819 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:59:50.990 --> 03:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:00.429 --> 04:00:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:03.229 --> 04:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
hi chair and members of the chair
 
04:00:05.210 --> 04:00:05.220 align:start position:0%
um I just want to speak with you um not
 
04:00:07.070 --> 04:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
that I was very prepared for this today
 
04:00:09.349 --> 04:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
but you are asking about how this
 
04:00:11.809 --> 04:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
affected people and I was actually one
 
04:00:14.450 --> 04:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
of those people and when I could not
 
04:00:14.460 --> 04:00:15.530 align:start position:0%
of those people and when I could not
afford

04:00:15.530 --> 04:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
afford
 
04:00:17.750 --> 04:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
um certain appointments for my daughter
 
04:00:21.410 --> 04:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
because she had a disability and based
 
04:00:23.689 --> 04:00:23.699 align:start position:0%
on our situation my ex was the one that
 
04:00:25.670 --> 04:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
made all the money and I was the one
 
04:00:29.450 --> 04:00:29.460 align:start position:0%
that was caring for the children mostly
 
04:00:32.269 --> 04:00:32.279 align:start position:0%
um in my situation where he had the
 
04:00:35.450 --> 04:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
insurance and I had to pay the co-pays I
 
04:00:37.550 --> 04:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
got to a certain situation where I could
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
not pay those co-pays and he was
 
04:00:41.929 --> 04:00:41.939 align:start position:0%
supposed to pick up the other portion of
 
04:00:45.290 --> 04:00:45.300 align:start position:0%
that and he did not and what happened in
 
04:00:48.530 --> 04:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
my situation was anything outside of a
 
04:00:50.929 --> 04:00:50.939 align:start position:0%
certain Network they did not cover or
 
04:00:53.030 --> 04:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
they covered 80 percent or whatever the
 
04:00:55.070 --> 04:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
percentage was
 
04:00:57.110 --> 04:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately
 
04:01:00.410 --> 04:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
he did not feel obligated to pay these
 
04:01:03.530 --> 04:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
medical expenses and because I was the
 
04:01:04.910 --> 04:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
parent that took them to the
 
04:01:07.130 --> 04:01:07.140 align:start position:0%
appointments and this is where we have a
 
04:01:09.590 --> 04:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
big gap in the law people
 
04:01:12.050 --> 04:01:12.060 align:start position:0%
um whoever takes that child to the
 
04:01:14.630 --> 04:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
doctors is the one that bears the
 
04:01:17.030 --> 04:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
financial burden I'm going to interrupt
 
04:01:18.590 --> 04:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
you here and I'm not quite sure how this
 
04:01:20.990 --> 04:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
relates to the bill before us uh it may
 
04:01:23.929 --> 04:01:23.939 align:start position:0%
relate to bills we're having later well
 
04:01:25.969 --> 04:01:25.979 align:start position:0%
but this has to do with the right to
 
04:01:28.969 --> 04:01:28.979 align:start position:0%
choose the counselor or the right to be
 
04:01:30.830 --> 04:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
evaluated that's where I'm going with
 
04:01:33.650 --> 04:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
this all right so in my situation
 
04:01:35.750 --> 04:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
because I could not afford these things
 
04:01:38.090 --> 04:01:38.100 align:start position:0%
and he carried the insurance he was
 
04:01:41.269 --> 04:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
demanding who these people went to and
 
04:01:43.490 --> 04:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because I was the one that
 
04:01:45.889 --> 04:01:45.899 align:start position:0%
was taking them it fell on me
 
04:01:49.250 --> 04:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
financially so it hit my credit I went
 
04:01:52.010 --> 04:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
into very bad credit standing because of
 
04:01:53.689 --> 04:01:53.699 align:start position:0%
his lack of payment
 
04:01:56.090 --> 04:01:56.100 align:start position:0%
then it got to the point that I had to
 
04:01:59.630 --> 04:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
go on State Insurance because I could
 
04:02:03.769 --> 04:02:03.779 align:start position:0%
not afford the people that he picked so
 
04:02:08.630 --> 04:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
as a person of my stature I was the
 
04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
housewife so to speak and the
 
04:02:13.490 --> 04:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
stay-at-home mom and self-employed
 
04:02:13.500 --> 04:02:14.809 align:start position:0%
stay-at-home mom and self-employed
business

04:02:14.809 --> 04:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:02:18.889 --> 04:02:18.899 align:start position:0%
so I did not have the rights that most
 
04:02:20.269 --> 04:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
people do
 
04:02:23.030 --> 04:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
in a relationship it's not going into an
 
04:02:25.929 --> 04:02:25.939 align:start position:0%
even ground whoever carries a financial
 
04:02:28.910 --> 04:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
amount and in this case he did he made
 
04:02:32.210 --> 04:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
150 000 versus what I made which was
 
04:02:35.689 --> 04:02:35.699 align:start position:0%
closer to like 70. it's all income based
 
04:02:37.670 --> 04:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
but it took me a while to get to where I
 
04:02:39.370 --> 04:02:39.380 align:start position:0%
am because it was a brand new business
 
04:02:42.889 --> 04:02:42.899 align:start position:0%
but it so getting back to where you're
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
trying to go here is Whoever has that
 
04:02:45.840 --> 04:02:47.150 align:start position:0%
trying to go here is Whoever has that
Financial

04:02:47.150 --> 04:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
Financial
 
04:02:50.870 --> 04:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
Drive is the one that gets to pick and
 
04:02:52.849 --> 04:02:52.859 align:start position:0%
they don't care the burden that is put
 
04:02:54.490 --> 04:02:54.500 align:start position:0%
on the other parent a lot of the times
 
04:02:57.710 --> 04:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
and the judges don't care
 
04:02:59.929 --> 04:02:59.939 align:start position:0%
which way they go they're just trying to
 
04:03:01.790 --> 04:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
find a happy medium on that insurance
 
04:03:04.070 --> 04:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
but they don't see that the financial
 
04:03:07.550 --> 04:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
burden really falls on the parent that
 
04:03:10.189 --> 04:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
brings this child to the doctors so
 
04:03:11.750 --> 04:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's just what I wanted to leave you
 
04:03:13.610 --> 04:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
with because I again I wasn't prepared
 
04:03:15.469 --> 04:03:15.479 align:start position:0%
for this but I wanted you to know from
 
04:03:18.530 --> 04:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
my point of view that this is what Hit
 
04:03:22.090 --> 04:03:22.100 align:start position:0%
me hard and put me in a financial
 
04:03:24.889 --> 04:03:24.899 align:start position:0%
situation where I could not recover from
 
04:03:26.750 --> 04:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
now you said you weren't prepared but
 
04:03:29.570 --> 04:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
you sure do ad-lib well I lived this
 
04:03:32.630 --> 04:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
life since 2014 and it was not an easy
 
04:03:34.670 --> 04:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
life thank you would you take some
 
04:03:36.830 --> 04:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any anybody
 
04:03:36.840 --> 04:03:39.769 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any anybody
questions

04:03:39.769 --> 04:03:39.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:42.830 --> 04:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
04:03:44.630 --> 04:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
um sorry I just wanted to know at the
 
04:03:46.490 --> 04:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
end of all that do you think that this
 
04:03:47.630 --> 04:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
language would have helped your
 
04:03:47.640 --> 04:03:49.250 align:start position:0%
language would have helped your
situation

04:03:49.250 --> 04:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:03:51.950 --> 04:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
um it hasn't entered yet so absolutely
 
04:03:53.870 --> 04:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
if I was in that situation at the very
 
04:03:55.790 --> 04:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
beginning I would not have fallen into
 
04:03:58.309 --> 04:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
collections I would not have fallen into
 
04:04:00.830 --> 04:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
the situation that I'm in financially in
 
04:04:03.590 --> 04:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
this burden representative Moulton
 
04:04:05.330 --> 04:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:04:06.530 --> 04:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
um you're absolutely right because
 
04:04:08.450 --> 04:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
co-pays are are due at the time of
 
04:04:10.010 --> 04:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
service so I've got a kind of be a
 
04:04:11.809 --> 04:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
question so that's what I'm getting
 
04:04:14.150 --> 04:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
would you believe that then you say what
 
04:04:16.729 --> 04:04:16.739 align:start position:0%
you want to say okay
 
04:04:20.450 --> 04:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
but what I'm getting at is is there a
 
04:04:23.510 --> 04:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
possibility in certain situations that
 
04:04:26.510 --> 04:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
you and your ex or or a person and their
 
04:04:29.809 --> 04:04:29.819 align:start position:0%
ex could make an agreement as I'm the
 
04:04:31.490 --> 04:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
one that's taking the kid to the
 
04:04:33.469 --> 04:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointment because it is
 
04:04:36.290 --> 04:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
easier due to my schedule could you help
 
04:04:38.990 --> 04:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
pay the co-pay because I think that's
 
04:04:40.670 --> 04:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
the only way someone would be able to
 
04:04:42.410 --> 04:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
get out of your type of situation would
 
04:04:44.510 --> 04:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
you believe would you believe I believe
 
04:04:47.030 --> 04:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
that is not going to be correct the
 
04:04:49.790 --> 04:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
reason being is my ex and I could not
 
04:04:51.229 --> 04:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
make an agreement to the very beginning
 
04:04:53.450 --> 04:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
we had to have the judges intervene on
 
04:04:56.630 --> 04:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
every aspect of it and because certain
 
04:04:59.630 --> 04:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
situations took higher priority
 
04:05:02.090 --> 04:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
my attorney kept saying we cannot bring
 
04:05:03.769 --> 04:05:03.779 align:start position:0%
this to court yet they're already
 
04:05:06.050 --> 04:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
looking at too many problems so if this
 
04:05:10.070 --> 04:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
was an automatic part of the law where
 
04:05:13.130 --> 04:05:13.140 align:start position:0%
it automatically says both parties are
 
04:05:14.929 --> 04:05:14.939 align:start position:0%
responsible or in
 
04:05:16.969 --> 04:05:16.979 align:start position:0%
a portion of it
 
04:05:20.750 --> 04:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
is you know say 40 60 or whatever the
 
04:05:22.189 --> 04:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
case may be
 
04:05:24.530 --> 04:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
I think that would help somebody of a
 
04:05:26.870 --> 04:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
lower Financial
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
income because it's not fair walking in
 
04:05:32.330 --> 04:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
you're not at certain levels you're not
 
04:05:35.450 --> 04:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
equal and that's where the the law falls
 
04:05:38.510 --> 04:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
short is they assume everybody's equal
 
04:05:41.750 --> 04:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
and treated fairly and they're not good
 
04:05:43.250 --> 04:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:05:45.530 --> 04:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony thank

Guardian leaders up here in New
 
04:07:14.570 --> 04:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well so there are often
 
04:07:15.950 --> 04:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
times where the guardian Elena will
 
04:07:17.929 --> 04:07:17.939 align:start position:0%
recommend a particular therapist that's
 
04:07:20.150 --> 04:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
at a network I'm sure many of you know
 
04:07:23.090 --> 04:07:23.100 align:start position:0%
if you're familiar with mental health in
 
04:07:24.530 --> 04:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that many
 
04:07:27.050 --> 04:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
therapists choose not to enter uh health
 
04:07:29.150 --> 04:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
insurance Network plans and they charge
 
04:07:31.729 --> 04:07:31.739 align:start position:0%
a significant amount up to 150 200 an
 
04:07:34.070 --> 04:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
hour our private rates 200 an hour but
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
that's just someone's making a
 
04:07:36.530 --> 04:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of money two hundred
 
04:07:38.510 --> 04:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars or more a year
 
04:07:38.520 --> 04:07:39.110 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars or more a year
um

04:07:39.110 --> 04:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:41.330 --> 04:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
in this case we do get a lot of families
 
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
that are referred to us because we take
 
04:07:44.450 --> 04:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
every major Insurance including Medicaid
 
04:07:46.929 --> 04:07:46.939 align:start position:0%
and at our agency so we do a lot of
 
04:07:49.070 --> 04:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
family counseling family systems
 
04:07:50.750 --> 04:07:50.760 align:start position:0%

counseling which is um
 
04:07:57.050 --> 04:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
very common in these type of cases where
 
04:07:58.670 --> 04:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
the parents are essentially using the
 
04:08:01.250 --> 04:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
child as a pawn uh to for their own
 
04:08:04.130 --> 04:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
means and and we do a lot of that
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
Services here uh there is
 
04:08:08.570 --> 04:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
stories I could tell you a story after
 
04:08:10.550 --> 04:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
Story of speaking to clients who have
 
04:08:12.110 --> 04:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
been trying to find a therapist who's
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
been told to go this one that when they
 
04:08:15.710 --> 04:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
aren't in network and they're they want
 
04:08:18.170 --> 04:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
to charge them 150 an hour and we can
 
04:08:20.689 --> 04:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
all be honest the probate and the family
 
04:08:23.510 --> 04:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
court system uh in any state especially
 
04:08:25.010 --> 04:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and the state that
 
04:08:27.469 --> 04:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
I'm a gal in Massachusetts it's everyone
 
04:08:29.030 --> 04:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
wants to make sure they get paid if
 
04:08:30.830 --> 04:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
someone has the financial ability to do
 
04:08:33.469 --> 04:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
so attorneys need to get paid therapists
 
04:08:35.030 --> 04:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
want to get paid Garden Millennials want
 
04:08:36.889 --> 04:08:36.899 align:start position:0%
to get paid I think this bill helps
 
04:08:38.689 --> 04:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
insurance companies kick in their fair
 
04:08:41.389 --> 04:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
share of it to reduce the burden on the
 
04:08:43.130 --> 04:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
actual parents and the children who are
 
04:08:44.929 --> 04:08:44.939 align:start position:0%
going through a very difficult time in
 
04:08:46.729 --> 04:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
their lives I think this would be a
 
04:08:50.450 --> 04:08:50.460 align:start position:0%
great uh way to limit the burden the
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
financial impacts over the very costly
 
04:08:55.189 --> 04:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
system that is the family court
 
04:08:56.750 --> 04:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
and I could answer some of the questions
 
04:08:58.309 --> 04:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
that were asked earlier but if you have
 
04:08:59.809 --> 04:08:59.819 align:start position:0%

an executive committee I believe too for
 
04:09:10.849 --> 04:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
the county you can vouch for him I I
 
04:09:12.110 --> 04:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
don't know if he'll vouch for me but
 
04:09:18.469 --> 04:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:20.630 --> 04:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:09:23.809 --> 04:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Vlog having time for
 
04:09:28.070 --> 04:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
him yes chairman uh do you do you um
 
04:09:30.110 --> 04:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
do you take clients that are court
 
04:09:33.290 --> 04:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
ordered with no insurance so we haven't
 
04:09:35.150 --> 04:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
had clients court order with no
 
04:09:36.889 --> 04:09:36.899 align:start position:0%
insurance there have been situations
 
04:09:38.570 --> 04:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
where clients have been court ordered to
 
04:09:40.729 --> 04:09:40.739 align:start position:0%
our agency and we've helped them apply
 
04:09:43.370 --> 04:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid uh and then they get on
 
04:09:45.050 --> 04:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and then we can take New
 
04:09:46.969 --> 04:09:46.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Healthy Families well since uh
 
04:09:50.210 --> 04:09:50.220 align:start position:0%
or amerihealth there are times that very
 
04:09:53.150 --> 04:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
very rarely will you find a child a
 
04:09:55.309 --> 04:09:55.319 align:start position:0%
child under 18 without health insurance
 
04:09:57.590 --> 04:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
in the state and if they don't have
 
04:09:59.269 --> 04:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
health insurance and they their family
 
04:10:02.150 --> 04:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
has the mean lacks the means they're
 
04:10:04.550 --> 04:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
easily I'm talking about very easily
 
04:10:06.170 --> 04:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
qualified for Medicaid in this state
 
04:10:09.229 --> 04:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
okay and I'll follow follow-up uh with
 
04:10:11.389 --> 04:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
respect to co-pays
 
04:10:14.090 --> 04:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
is what we've heard earlier is that if
 
04:10:16.790 --> 04:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
I'm the one bringing the uh bringing the
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
child I'm doing the copay even though my
 
04:10:22.729 --> 04:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
spouse is responsible for the payment is
 
04:10:25.070 --> 04:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
there a delineation from that so
 
04:10:25.080 --> 04:10:26.030 align:start position:0%
there a delineation from that so
typically

04:10:26.030 --> 04:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
typically
 
04:10:26.040 --> 04:10:27.110 align:start position:0%
typically
[Music]

04:10:27.110 --> 04:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
if two parents bring a child they're
 
04:10:31.130 --> 04:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
both financially responsible unless
 
04:10:32.689 --> 04:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
there's a court order and this is my
 
04:10:34.189 --> 04:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
agency's policies other agencies might
 
04:10:35.809 --> 04:10:35.819 align:start position:0%
have different policies if there's a
 
04:10:37.250 --> 04:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
court order that says one parent is
 
04:10:38.870 --> 04:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
financially responsible for the co-pays
 
04:10:40.309 --> 04:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
and one's responsible for providing the
 
04:10:42.110 --> 04:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
insurance then yes then we would have to
 
04:10:43.910 --> 04:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
seek the co-pays from that uh one parent
 
04:10:45.410 --> 04:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
that the court has ordered responsible
 
04:10:47.570 --> 04:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
there's no court order they're both
 
04:10:49.550 --> 04:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for their child's finances
 
04:10:51.950 --> 04:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
if they don't pay in my case we bring
 
04:10:53.809 --> 04:10:53.819 align:start position:0%
them a small claims court and we resolve
 
04:10:55.010 --> 04:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
it there but we don't send anything to
 
04:11:00.830 --> 04:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:03.050 --> 04:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
great thank you for your testimony thank
 
04:11:05.389 --> 04:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
04:11:09.250 --> 04:11:09.260 align:start position:0%
this concludes the hearing on House Bill
 
04:11:11.290 --> 04:11:11.300 align:start position:0%
200 and
 
04:11:13.670 --> 04:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative NADA Upham is going to go
 
04:11:15.710 --> 04:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
talk to the lawyers and you'll be back
 
04:11:17.870 --> 04:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
and we'll probably exec this in two
 
04:11:17.880 --> 04:11:19.550 align:start position:0%
and we'll probably exec this in two
weeks

04:11:19.550 --> 04:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
04:11:23.750 --> 04:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:26.030 --> 04:11:26.040 align:start position:0%

I

04:11:30.010 --> 04:11:30.020 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:11:33.610 --> 04:11:33.620 align:start position:0%
would make a motion to exec it now
 
04:11:37.429 --> 04:11:37.439 align:start position:0%
because I don't necessarily see it as a
 
04:11:39.590 --> 04:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
high priority to make sure we get
 
04:11:42.790 --> 04:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
further language into the amendment
 
04:11:42.800 --> 04:11:44.410 align:start position:0%
further language into the amendment
about

04:11:44.410 --> 04:11:44.420 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:11:48.650 --> 04:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
uh families that don't
 
04:11:52.130 --> 04:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
um have insurance if what the person who
 
04:11:54.530 --> 04:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
just testified says uh happens rarely
 
04:11:56.330 --> 04:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
you don't have standing to make that
 
04:11:58.250 --> 04:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
motion okay that is solely in the
 
04:12:00.110 --> 04:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
discretion of the chair now in
 
04:12:01.849 --> 04:12:01.859 align:start position:0%
consultation with the vice chair okay
 
04:12:03.889 --> 04:12:03.899 align:start position:0%

Virginia you shouldn't get married when

I'm here today to introduce HB 34fn
 
04:13:55.790 --> 04:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
which raises the marriage age from 16 to
 
04:13:55.800 --> 04:13:58.490 align:start position:0%
which raises the marriage age from 16 to
18.

04:13:58.490 --> 04:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
18.
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
the reason for this bill is I have
 
04:14:03.170 --> 04:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
received throughout my journey of
 
04:14:05.269 --> 04:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
fighting this
 
04:14:08.349 --> 04:14:08.359 align:start position:0%
so many letters of survivors
 
04:14:11.290 --> 04:14:11.300 align:start position:0%
of people in support
 
04:14:16.370 --> 04:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to give you the data that
 
04:14:18.769 --> 04:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
follows all of those stories that I've
 
04:14:20.990 --> 04:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
listed in my testimony
 
04:14:22.849 --> 04:14:22.859 align:start position:0%
which is
 
04:14:22.859 --> 04:14:24.650 align:start position:0%
which is
that

04:14:24.650 --> 04:14:24.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:28.309 --> 04:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
it is a lifelong impact on people's
 
04:14:28.319 --> 04:14:29.450 align:start position:0%
it is a lifelong impact on people's
lives

04:14:29.450 --> 04:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
lives
 
04:14:34.969 --> 04:14:34.979 align:start position:0%
they will always be affected by the
 
04:14:38.510 --> 04:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
child marriage it lasts Generations
 
04:14:38.520 --> 04:14:39.950 align:start position:0%
child marriage it lasts Generations
and

04:14:39.950 --> 04:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
it never ends until someone decides to
 
04:14:45.610 --> 04:14:45.620 align:start position:0%
stop it
 
04:14:48.670 --> 04:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:14:51.710 --> 04:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
coincides with domestic violence human
 
04:14:54.769 --> 04:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
trafficking and so much more
 
04:14:57.710 --> 04:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
and I
 
04:15:01.309 --> 04:15:01.319 align:start position:0%
have also
 
04:15:05.090 --> 04:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of the opposition for this
 
04:15:09.530 --> 04:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
is teen pregnancy and the military
 
04:15:13.550 --> 04:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
we are at the second lowest
 
04:15:16.429 --> 04:15:16.439 align:start position:0%
teen pregnancy rates in the US
 
04:15:20.269 --> 04:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is the lowest
 
04:15:22.910 --> 04:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh as for the military
 
04:15:26.269 --> 04:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
the military is
 
04:15:30.229 --> 04:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
against those that are using their men
 
04:15:33.590 --> 04:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
and women that are serving as benefits
 
04:15:36.349 --> 04:15:36.359 align:start position:0%
as using their benefits towards their
 
04:15:42.189 --> 04:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
advantage and they since DNA has been
 
04:15:46.070 --> 04:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
involved and especially with crime and
 
04:15:48.349 --> 04:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
everything they have used it to
 
04:15:50.990 --> 04:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
determine paternity and it will give the
 
04:15:54.290 --> 04:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
benefits to that child and they can now
 
04:15:54.300 --> 04:15:55.630 align:start position:0%
benefits to that child and they can now
designate

04:15:55.630 --> 04:15:55.640 align:start position:0%
designate
 
04:16:00.410 --> 04:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
benefits towards spouses towards anyone
 
04:16:03.530 --> 04:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
that they decide they want to receive
 
04:16:06.650 --> 04:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:06.660 --> 04:16:10.370 align:start position:0%
 
um so

04:16:10.370 --> 04:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:14.090 --> 04:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
part of my journey I have found child
 
04:16:16.429 --> 04:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
marriage was in my family
 
04:16:19.130 --> 04:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
I knew of my grandmother who was married
 
04:16:22.790 --> 04:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
at 16 to a man in the military
 
04:16:26.450 --> 04:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
he was abusive towards her verbally and
 
04:16:28.550 --> 04:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
said this is how many women I have been
 
04:16:30.410 --> 04:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
with these are why they are so much
 
04:16:33.309 --> 04:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
better than you are
 
04:16:37.309 --> 04:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
and she had a child from that marriage
 
04:16:39.950 --> 04:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
she decided enough was enough she can't
 
04:16:42.590 --> 04:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
deal with that verbal attack every
 
04:16:44.689 --> 04:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
single day every time he came back from
 
04:16:45.950 --> 04:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
Pearl Harbor
 
04:16:48.349 --> 04:16:48.359 align:start position:0%
and decided to take her child and go
 
04:16:50.269 --> 04:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
back from Florida up to Massachusetts
 
04:16:53.570 --> 04:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
where she is originally from
 
04:16:57.469 --> 04:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
and then looking further I found that my
 
04:16:59.510 --> 04:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
great-grandmother on my mom's side on my
 
04:17:03.110 --> 04:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
dad's side sorry was married at 16 to a
 
04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
49 year old man who abused her verbally
 
04:17:09.530 --> 04:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
and in front of their children who
 
04:17:12.710 --> 04:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
thought that was okay for a marriage to
 
04:17:13.969 --> 04:17:13.979 align:start position:0%
be like that
 
04:17:16.550 --> 04:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
and that was passed down from generation
 
04:17:19.309 --> 04:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
to generation until someone decided to
 
04:17:22.010 --> 04:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
end that and say enough is enough which
 
04:17:24.110 --> 04:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
happens to be my parents
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
they decided no more of this drug
 
04:17:31.490 --> 04:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
alcohol any of that is enough is enough
 
04:17:34.870 --> 04:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
we don't want our child Me growing up
 
04:17:38.929 --> 04:17:38.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:38.939 --> 04:17:40.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:17:40.370 --> 04:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:43.610 --> 04:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
child brides are neither physically nor
 
04:17:45.889 --> 04:17:45.899 align:start position:0%
emotionally ready to become wives and
 
04:17:45.899 --> 04:17:47.269 align:start position:0%
emotionally ready to become wives and
mothers

04:17:47.269 --> 04:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
mothers
 
04:17:49.250 --> 04:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
they face more risks of experience
 
04:17:51.290 --> 04:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
stayed during conflict dangerous
 
04:17:53.269 --> 04:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
complications in pregnancy and
 
04:17:56.210 --> 04:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
childbirth they can contract HIV and

04:18:05.630 --> 04:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
with little access to education and
 
04:18:07.729 --> 04:18:07.739 align:start position:0%
economic opportunities saying their
 
04:18:10.250 --> 04:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
families are more likely to live in
 
04:18:12.410 --> 04:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
poverty and the generations after them
 
04:18:15.590 --> 04:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:18.349 --> 04:18:18.359 align:start position:0%

in our family
 
04:18:26.090 --> 04:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
and most of my relatives work in
 
04:18:29.030 --> 04:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
low-paying jobs and
 
04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
live right along the federal poverty
 
04:18:31.680 --> 04:18:32.450 align:start position:0%
live right along the federal poverty
line

04:18:32.450 --> 04:18:32.460 align:start position:0%

04:18:35.710 --> 04:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
child marriage is Insidious and affects
 
04:18:39.530 --> 04:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
Generations it's not just sticking with
 
04:18:43.790 --> 04:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
that one girl in that one marriage
 
04:18:45.889 --> 04:18:45.899 align:start position:0%
some people feel like 16 70 year old
 
04:18:48.229 --> 04:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
children know what love is and fully
 
04:18:49.809 --> 04:18:49.819 align:start position:0%
understand that they are potentially
 
04:18:51.950 --> 04:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
understand what they know what they're
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
getting themselves into the reality is
 
04:18:56.590 --> 04:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
they themselves
 
04:18:59.870 --> 04:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
do not know what the situations they are
 
04:19:03.830 --> 04:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:07.849 --> 04:19:07.859 align:start position:0%
80 of these marriages end in divorce
 
04:19:11.689 --> 04:19:11.699 align:start position:0%
and the data is there I actually have my
 
04:19:14.110 --> 04:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
six inch binder it's in the other room
 
04:19:17.809 --> 04:19:17.819 align:start position:0%
of all of this and I'm
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
have it all in my head I'm trying to
 
04:19:21.229 --> 04:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
digitize it too so that way it's more
 
04:19:24.110 --> 04:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
portable than a six inch binder
 
04:19:24.120 --> 04:19:24.950 align:start position:0%
portable than a six inch binder
um

04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:29.570 --> 04:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:32.990 --> 04:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
stories that I have been told are
 
04:19:35.150 --> 04:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
like this one my husband put a dog
 
04:19:37.010 --> 04:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
collar around my neck and trust me up on
 
04:19:38.510 --> 04:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
the floor in front of my parents just to
 
04:19:41.330 --> 04:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
prove to them that he could control me
 
04:19:43.849 --> 04:19:43.859 align:start position:0%
another one my husband was a monster For
 
04:19:46.790 --> 04:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
the Love of All That is Holy please do
 
04:19:49.010 --> 04:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
not let another child go through what I
 
04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:54.650 --> 04:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
another I was alone my husband deployed
 
04:19:56.689 --> 04:19:56.699 align:start position:0%
to Germany I had a high risk pregnancy
 
04:19:59.030 --> 04:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
my parents flew my sister to California
 
04:20:01.729 --> 04:20:01.739 align:start position:0%
to come and drive me across country so
 
04:20:03.290 --> 04:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
that my family could help me with the
 
04:20:06.050 --> 04:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
birth of my son my husband did not see
 
04:20:08.269 --> 04:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
his son until he was 19 months old they
 
04:20:10.389 --> 04:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
never bonded
 
04:20:13.610 --> 04:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
the final one is I was 16 and I wanted
 
04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
to escape abusive living situation that
 
04:20:18.650 --> 04:20:18.660 align:start position:0%

04:20:20.030 --> 04:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
when he came back from his appointment
 
04:20:22.010 --> 04:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
in Hawaii used to verbally assault me
 
04:20:23.809 --> 04:20:23.819 align:start position:0%
and tell me all of the other women he
 
04:20:26.030 --> 04:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
had been with
 
04:20:28.849 --> 04:20:28.859 align:start position:0%
I didn't know how to get a divorce I
 
04:20:32.630 --> 04:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:36.050 --> 04:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
I as you will no doubt here today many
 
04:20:38.030 --> 04:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
children find themselves in a marriage
 
04:20:41.090 --> 04:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
situation that is no longer
 
04:20:44.210 --> 04:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
problem that they thought
 
04:20:46.429 --> 04:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
was possible they never thought that
 
04:20:47.929 --> 04:20:47.939 align:start position:0%
they would be in this situation when
 
04:20:49.670 --> 04:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
they married
 
04:20:52.610 --> 04:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
it isn't just the 16 and 17 year old
 
04:20:53.990 --> 04:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
that are in love that they want to get
 
04:20:55.969 --> 04:20:55.979 align:start position:0%
married because one of them is pregnant
 
04:20:59.389 --> 04:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
it's the 16 year old being forced into a
 
04:21:02.090 --> 04:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
marriage because a 49 year old man
 
04:21:05.809 --> 04:21:05.819 align:start position:0%
decided I want to marry her and
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
approached her parents and said I love
 
04:21:11.170 --> 04:21:11.180 align:start position:0%
your daughter here's some money
 
04:21:15.110 --> 04:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
if you just let me marry her and due to
 
04:21:17.990 --> 04:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
States laws and how lacks some of them
 
04:21:20.269 --> 04:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
are when it comes to marriage
 
04:21:22.729 --> 04:21:22.739 align:start position:0%
they only needed one parent's permission
 
04:21:26.030 --> 04:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
and that person gave it and signed the
 
04:21:29.330 --> 04:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
paperwork and that girl was married and
 
04:21:33.410 --> 04:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
she was they were abused they were
 
04:21:35.150 --> 04:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
there's so many different situations
 
04:21:40.370 --> 04:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
I've heard of women being sent off to
 
04:21:42.650 --> 04:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
other countries that they don't know the
 
04:21:44.450 --> 04:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
language they don't speak it they're not
 
04:21:47.030 --> 04:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
from there but their family is because
 
04:21:49.849 --> 04:21:49.859 align:start position:0%
that one person knew them
 
04:21:52.429 --> 04:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
through somewhere
 
04:21:54.530 --> 04:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
and it's different for each girl but
 
04:21:56.750 --> 04:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
they all say the same thing that he was
 
04:21:59.929 --> 04:21:59.939 align:start position:0%
a monster please never take me back into
 
04:22:01.910 --> 04:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
that situation again please do not bring
 
04:22:04.010 --> 04:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
another girl into that situation again
 
04:22:06.830 --> 04:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
that is when I'm asked every single time
 
04:22:11.630 --> 04:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
and I get approached by strangers who
 
04:22:14.150 --> 04:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
recognize me and say thank you so much
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
for ending this for stopping this I do
 
04:22:19.729 --> 04:22:19.739 align:start position:0%
not want another girl going through what
 
04:22:24.309 --> 04:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
children do not have the right to marry
 
04:22:29.269 --> 04:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
because they cannot sign a legal
 
04:22:31.729 --> 04:22:31.739 align:start position:0%
Contract Marriage is a legal contract
 
04:22:35.870 --> 04:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
you have to be 18 to sign a contract why
 
04:22:39.170 --> 04:22:39.180 align:start position:0%
do we allow 16 year olds to sign a legal
 
04:22:45.469 --> 04:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:49.550 --> 04:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
with HB 34fn we are powering children by
 
04:22:51.769 --> 04:22:51.779 align:start position:0%
ensuring that they wait until they
 
04:22:54.110 --> 04:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
decide on their own who they want to
 
04:22:57.229 --> 04:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
marry and why they want to marry and not
 
04:22:59.210 --> 04:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
let an adult decide for them just
 
04:23:02.330 --> 04:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
because of money or whatever situation
 
04:23:04.729 --> 04:23:04.739 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:23:07.070 --> 04:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
there is no data that supports child
 
04:23:10.309 --> 04:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
marriage it is not beneficial to one
 
04:23:13.790 --> 04:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
child none we do not allow exceptions to
 
04:23:18.110 --> 04:23:18.120 align:start position:0%

04:23:20.150 --> 04:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
those ages based on people who can
 
04:23:23.689 --> 04:23:23.699 align:start position:0%
engage safely in those activities we

04:23:33.650 --> 04:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
the likelihood of divorce is 80 percent
 
04:23:36.710 --> 04:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
for those who marry in mid-adolescence
 
04:23:39.950 --> 04:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
then drop steadily
 
04:23:44.030 --> 04:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
delaying marriage until the mid-20s in
 
04:23:47.030 --> 04:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
reduces one's likelihood of divorce to

30 percent

women who marry age 21 or younger
 
04:23:54.170 --> 04:23:54.180 align:start position:0%
experience worse mental and physical
 
04:23:57.650 --> 04:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
health and attain less education and

earn lower wages than those who marry

04:24:09.950 --> 04:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
um as lawmakers we have an obligations
 
04:24:12.710 --> 04:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
to our citizens to lead them on a path
 
04:24:15.410 --> 04:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
of a success New Hampshire has made sure
 
04:24:17.510 --> 04:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
that the tools to empower these girls
 
04:24:20.210 --> 04:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
are available they can access insurance
 
04:24:23.030 --> 04:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
through New Hampshire Medicaid services
 
04:24:26.030 --> 04:24:26.040 align:start position:0%

girls can get the parental care they

need through a variety of sources
 
04:24:42.889 --> 04:24:42.899 align:start position:0%
located throughout the state and they
 
04:24:46.550 --> 04:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
can get rides to the care provider
 
04:24:51.889 --> 04:24:51.899 align:start position:0%
in 2023 I think that a pregnant teen is
 
04:24:54.469 --> 04:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
on their own is a ridiculous outdated
 
04:24:56.570 --> 04:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
notion marriage should not be encouraged
 
04:24:59.330 --> 04:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
just because it is viewed as a solution
 
04:25:01.790 --> 04:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
to a problem there are many options for
 
04:25:03.650 --> 04:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
them out there if they want to keep the
 
04:25:06.889 --> 04:25:06.899 align:start position:0%
child it is not just
 
04:25:12.590 --> 04:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:15.290 --> 04:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
pregnancies exceptions to marriage age
 
04:25:17.630 --> 04:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
has been used to cover up rape and to
 
04:25:19.849 --> 04:25:19.859 align:start position:0%
force girls to marry their rapists
 
04:25:21.950 --> 04:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
marriage license data obtained from
 
04:25:24.710 --> 04:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
across the U.S so an alarming number of
 
04:25:26.750 --> 04:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
child rapists recently were handed
 
04:25:29.090 --> 04:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
marriage licenses instead of prisons and
 
04:25:34.490 --> 04:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:34.500 --> 04:25:36.229 align:start position:0%

um if New Hampshire creates a pregnancy
 
04:25:41.269 --> 04:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
exception while other states move on in
 
04:25:43.010 --> 04:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
the opposite direction New Hampshire can
 
04:25:46.429 --> 04:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
easily become a destination wedding site
 
04:25:48.229 --> 04:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
where parents take their daughters who
 
04:25:49.849 --> 04:25:49.859 align:start position:0%
have been raped to force them into

04:25:53.570 --> 04:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
04:25:55.790 --> 04:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
what we want New Hampshire to be known
 
04:25:57.950 --> 04:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
as just a few months ago in
 
04:26:00.590 --> 04:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts just passed a law to raise
 
04:26:02.929 --> 04:26:02.939 align:start position:0%
it to 18 and other states are following
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
in suit
 
04:26:06.769 --> 04:26:06.779 align:start position:0%
and I am helping that fight in Vermont
 
04:26:09.710 --> 04:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
and Connecticut also
 
04:26:09.720 --> 04:26:11.990 align:start position:0%
and Connecticut also
um

04:26:11.990 --> 04:26:12.000 align:start position:0%

we know girls who married before age 19
 
04:26:27.769 --> 04:26:27.779 align:start position:0%
are 50 more likely than an American Girl
 
04:26:29.630 --> 04:26:29.640 align:start position:0%

the paperwork that I handed out is some
 
04:27:23.149 --> 04:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
data that I've collected on through

Unchained at last has provided a lot of
 
04:27:31.910 --> 04:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
the data when it comes to child

child marriage throughout the world this
 
04:27:41.990 --> 04:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
is not a small
 
04:27:44.689 --> 04:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
third world country problem this is a
 
04:27:47.330 --> 04:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
problem here in the US it's a problem in
 
04:27:51.170 --> 04:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
England and many countries like us where
 
04:27:53.389 --> 04:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
we are more developed where we are more
 
04:27:56.389 --> 04:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
have a better society and better places
 
04:27:59.210 --> 04:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
where we can take care of our children
 
04:28:01.610 --> 04:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
so why is still why is child marriage

04:28:22.309 --> 04:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
can you tell me how many
 
04:28:25.610 --> 04:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
uh marriages took place in the last five
 
04:28:27.290 --> 04:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
years in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:28:30.290 --> 04:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18.
 
04:28:34.189 --> 04:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
I believe the last count was five and I
 
04:28:36.710 --> 04:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
believe that's five too many
 
04:28:40.130 --> 04:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:42.530 --> 04:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for that answer so in that
 
04:28:47.389 --> 04:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
case uh in your bill you say
 
04:28:51.290 --> 04:28:51.300 align:start position:0%
um that all marriages contracted by such
 
04:28:55.370 --> 04:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
persons shall become shall be null and
 
04:28:58.429 --> 04:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
void so are we to say that whether they
 
04:29:00.170 --> 04:29:00.180 align:start position:0%
want to stay in the marriage or not
 
04:29:02.389 --> 04:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
their marriage will be now null and void
 
04:29:06.349 --> 04:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
because they married under the age
 
04:29:09.290 --> 04:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
no if that's what this says ma'am so
 
04:29:13.010 --> 04:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
okay can you help me I do apologize for
 
04:29:15.349 --> 04:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
that um unfortunately my bill has a lot
 
04:29:18.469 --> 04:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
of issues with it as you can see um my
 
04:29:22.490 --> 04:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
none of my uh co-sponsors were listed
 
04:29:24.290 --> 04:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
um and even though they all signed off
 
04:29:27.170 --> 04:29:27.180 align:start position:0%
and I signed off yeah
 
04:29:30.649 --> 04:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
um but OSL is having some startup
 
04:29:34.010 --> 04:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
problems geez yes
 
04:29:38.870 --> 04:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
um so I just want all marriages anybody
 
04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
that future wants anybody that's 16 from
 
04:29:46.849 --> 04:29:46.859 align:start position:0%
whenever the date is from on that wants
 
04:29:49.010 --> 04:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
a marriage license has to wait until
 
04:29:52.429 --> 04:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
they are 18. that's my intent one more
 
04:29:55.130 --> 04:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
follow-up so would you be amenable to
 
04:30:00.290 --> 04:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
amend your bill and remove the uh such
 
04:30:04.010 --> 04:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
persons marriages contracted by such
 
04:30:06.710 --> 04:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
persons will be null and void would you
 
04:30:10.550 --> 04:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
be okay about removing that sentence yes
 
04:30:13.990 --> 04:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your input
 
04:30:17.030 --> 04:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative Grossman
 
04:30:19.250 --> 04:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:30:20.929 --> 04:30:20.939 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this forward
 
04:30:24.349 --> 04:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
and for this important work
 
04:30:27.110 --> 04:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
um my question is do you know of any
 
04:30:30.769 --> 04:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
legally binding agreements that someone
 
04:30:34.969 --> 04:30:34.979 align:start position:0%
below the age of 18 can enter
 
04:30:37.790 --> 04:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
no they cannot even go onto the Disney
 
04:30:40.250 --> 04:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
Channel website
 
04:30:44.649 --> 04:30:44.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:48.410 --> 04:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative petrigno
 
04:30:50.149 --> 04:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:30:52.309 --> 04:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
04:30:55.010 --> 04:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
can a married uh individual under the
 
04:30:58.910 --> 04:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
age of 18 file for a divorce no they
 
04:31:00.649 --> 04:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
cannot because they can't contact
 
04:31:03.590 --> 04:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
contract a lawyer because a lawyer will
 
04:31:03.600 --> 04:31:04.370 align:start position:0%
contract a lawyer because a lawyer will
not

04:31:04.370 --> 04:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:31:07.849 --> 04:31:07.859 align:start position:0%
Allah represent
 
04:31:10.370 --> 04:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
someone under the age of 18 because they
 
04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
can't get into a contract because they
 
04:31:16.189 --> 04:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
are under 18. thank you very much
 
04:31:19.189 --> 04:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
04:31:21.710 --> 04:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:31:23.149 --> 04:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:31:25.010 --> 04:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
um what is the current age of consent
 
04:31:27.469 --> 04:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
for sexual activity here in New
 
04:31:31.750 --> 04:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is 16. okay 16 or 18
 
04:31:34.729 --> 04:31:34.739 align:start position:0%
16. okay and my second my yep my
 
04:31:36.590 --> 04:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up question is
 
04:31:38.210 --> 04:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
04:31:39.889 --> 04:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:31:43.330 --> 04:31:43.340 align:start position:0%
um so to follow up how does this
 
04:31:47.149 --> 04:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
intersect with New Hampshire's recent
 
04:31:51.370 --> 04:31:51.380 align:start position:0%
passing of a conditional emancipation
 
04:31:53.990 --> 04:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
procedure through the family court
 
04:31:57.290 --> 04:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
so with this this does not touch that
 
04:32:00.050 --> 04:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
this is just dealing with those that are
 
04:32:05.149 --> 04:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
under the age of six of 18. uh this does
 
04:32:07.849 --> 04:32:07.859 align:start position:0%
not touch emancipation just because that
 
04:32:12.649 --> 04:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
gets into a whole money mess of as far
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
as I know they still they would still
 
04:32:16.969 --> 04:32:16.979 align:start position:0%
have to be 18 because the
 
04:32:19.790 --> 04:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
emancipated minor can still not drink
 
04:32:23.530 --> 04:32:23.540 align:start position:0%
that kills still cannot
 
04:32:26.170 --> 04:32:26.180 align:start position:0%
drive they can't vote they can't
 
04:32:29.929 --> 04:32:29.939 align:start position:0%
anything that is set age wise they
 
04:32:32.330 --> 04:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
cannot do
 
04:32:36.849 --> 04:32:36.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:39.110 --> 04:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson
 
04:32:41.330 --> 04:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:32:43.429 --> 04:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:32:46.010 --> 04:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
um I did a little bit of research and
 
04:32:47.689 --> 04:32:47.699 align:start position:0%
um you know you're more of an expert on
 
04:32:50.210 --> 04:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
this than I am so I think you probably
 
04:32:52.370 --> 04:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
can answer the question but what I found
 
04:32:55.189 --> 04:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
is that by virtue of becoming married
 
04:32:58.490 --> 04:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
that minor would be emancipated and
 
04:33:00.170 --> 04:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
would be able to make
 
04:33:03.950 --> 04:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
um legal decisions on their behalf
 
04:33:07.250 --> 04:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
that is not true because they are still
 
04:33:10.849 --> 04:33:10.859 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18. the only way that
 
04:33:13.730 --> 04:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
they can become emancipated is if they
 
04:33:17.330 --> 04:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
have they go through that process and
 
04:33:19.789 --> 04:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
they are not right away emancipated
 
04:33:21.410 --> 04:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
right then and there just because they
 
04:33:22.429 --> 04:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
are married
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:29.390 --> 04:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
chair has a
 
04:33:29.400 --> 04:33:31.369 align:start position:0%
chair has a
question

04:33:31.369 --> 04:33:31.379 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:33:34.189 --> 04:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
um is it not true that much of what you
 
04:33:34.199 --> 04:33:35.570 align:start position:0%
um is it not true that much of what you
said

04:33:35.570 --> 04:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:33:35.580 --> 04:33:37.189 align:start position:0%
said
about

04:33:37.189 --> 04:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:33:41.869 --> 04:33:41.879 align:start position:0%
age 8 to 16 is also true at age 18 a 49
 
04:33:44.990 --> 04:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
year old man Marrying an 18 year old
 
04:33:48.131 --> 04:33:48.141 align:start position:0%
uh probably someone who marries at 18
 
04:33:51.109 --> 04:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
will not go to college just like a 16
 
04:33:54.349 --> 04:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
year old wouldn't that 18 year olds
 
04:34:01.070 --> 04:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
marrying suffer abuse and so many of the
 
04:34:04.369 --> 04:34:04.379 align:start position:0%
illustrations you used to my mind did
 
04:34:06.830 --> 04:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
not did not prove your point it proved
 
04:34:08.289 --> 04:34:08.299 align:start position:0%
there were bad people doing bad things
 
04:34:11.330 --> 04:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they're now 18 to have
 
04:34:13.970 --> 04:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
bad things done to them they're still
 
04:34:17.150 --> 04:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
bad things even though they're not 16.
 
04:34:17.160 --> 04:34:18.310 align:start position:0%
bad things even though they're not 16.
um

04:34:18.310 --> 04:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:21.650 --> 04:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
would you agree that upping it to age 18
 
04:34:24.529 --> 04:34:24.539 align:start position:0%
really doesn't prevent much of what you
 
04:34:26.150 --> 04:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
had said
 
04:34:28.910 --> 04:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
it helps them be able to fight back
 
04:34:31.910 --> 04:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
against those that have done wrong to
 
04:34:35.109 --> 04:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
them it allows them to give them time
 
04:34:38.449 --> 04:34:38.459 align:start position:0%
versus allowing them to have their
 
04:34:40.730 --> 04:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
voices silenced for years
 
04:34:43.970 --> 04:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
because even though it is those two
 
04:34:48.949 --> 04:34:48.959 align:start position:0%
years between 16 and 18. and eight if
 
04:34:50.929 --> 04:34:50.939 align:start position:0%
you look at a 16 year old and you tell
 
04:34:52.970 --> 04:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
them you can go to college you can do
 
04:34:55.730 --> 04:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
this yes I have friends setting that
 
04:34:57.590 --> 04:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
chose not to go to college that chose to
 
04:34:59.390 --> 04:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
go into the workforce right away I went
 
04:35:03.410 --> 04:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
to a CTC school where they offered that
 
04:35:08.150 --> 04:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
but a 16 year old making that decision
 
04:35:11.510 --> 04:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
being told what to do versus an 18 year
 
04:35:13.730 --> 04:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
old being told what to do
 
04:35:16.010 --> 04:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
is very different because the 16 year
 
04:35:18.109 --> 04:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
old being told what to do is taught
 
04:35:20.510 --> 04:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
listen to the mom listen to your dad
 
04:35:23.810 --> 04:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
listen to this person whereas an 18 year
 
04:35:23.820 --> 04:35:24.650 align:start position:0%
listen to this person whereas an 18 year
old

04:35:24.650 --> 04:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
old
 
04:35:24.660 --> 04:35:27.830 align:start position:0%
old
is

04:35:27.830 --> 04:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:30.590 --> 04:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
when they're told what to do they have a
 
04:35:33.289 --> 04:35:33.299 align:start position:0%
little bit less incentive to listen to
 
04:35:37.010 --> 04:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
that person because they are now 18 they
 
04:35:39.230 --> 04:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
are now an adult they have the right to
 
04:35:41.269 --> 04:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
make those decisions for themselves
 
04:35:46.010 --> 04:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
versus a 16 year old has less
 
04:35:48.230 --> 04:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
of a leg up
 
04:35:51.230 --> 04:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
than a an adult does it's harder for
 
04:35:54.769 --> 04:35:54.779 align:start position:0%
them to make those decisions say this is
 
04:35:56.990 --> 04:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
what I want when a whole bunch of adults
 
04:35:59.631 --> 04:35:59.641 align:start position:0%
in the rooms is saying no you gotta get
 
04:36:01.429 --> 04:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
married no you gotta get married
 
04:36:03.410 --> 04:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
and my follow-up question is I've I'm
 
04:36:06.109 --> 04:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
sorry I forgot how many 16 to 18 year
 
04:36:08.390 --> 04:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
old marriages were there last year I
 
04:36:08.400 --> 04:36:10.250 align:start position:0%
old marriages were there last year I
believe

04:36:10.250 --> 04:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:36:14.929 --> 04:36:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:19.269 --> 04:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
you don't know I don't know okay
 
04:36:21.410 --> 04:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton
 
04:36:24.109 --> 04:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman isn't it true
 
04:36:27.650 --> 04:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
though that even though there's not a
 
04:36:30.051 --> 04:36:30.061 align:start position:0%
large difference between in two years
 
04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
whether it be 47 to 49 versus 16 to 18
 
04:36:37.369 --> 04:36:37.379 align:start position:0%
that the human brain is still developing
 
04:36:40.609 --> 04:36:40.619 align:start position:0%
during the years of 16 to 18 and it
 
04:36:43.849 --> 04:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
reaches full development at age 25 so
 
04:36:45.470 --> 04:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
therefore there is a significant
 
04:36:45.480 --> 04:36:46.609 align:start position:0%
therefore there is a significant
difference

04:36:46.609 --> 04:36:46.619 align:start position:0%
difference
 
04:36:49.131 --> 04:36:49.141 align:start position:0%
if you would agree
 
04:36:51.650 --> 04:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
um I believe that there is a significant
 
04:36:54.890 --> 04:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
difference between 16 to 18 versus 47 to
 
04:37:00.830 --> 04:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:04.670 --> 04:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:06.590 --> 04:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
again thank you Mr chairman you're
 
04:37:06.600 --> 04:37:07.970 align:start position:0%
again thank you Mr chairman you're
welcome

04:37:07.970 --> 04:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
04:37:07.980 --> 04:37:09.890 align:start position:0%
welcome
um

04:37:09.890 --> 04:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:12.349 --> 04:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
it was common at one time
 
04:37:14.929 --> 04:37:14.939 align:start position:0%
that if a girl should get pregnant at 15
 
04:37:16.970 --> 04:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
16 in fact it was very common when I was
 
04:37:18.890 --> 04:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
in high school
 
04:37:21.051 --> 04:37:21.061 align:start position:0%
um against sexual activity is even more
 
04:37:22.609 --> 04:37:22.619 align:start position:0%
common I believe it's just not the
 
04:37:24.709 --> 04:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is just common
 
04:37:26.510 --> 04:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:37:28.369 --> 04:37:28.379 align:start position:0%
and and none of those girls would get
 
04:37:28.379 --> 04:37:30.310 align:start position:0%
and and none of those girls would get
married

04:37:30.310 --> 04:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
married
 
04:37:35.090 --> 04:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
but who pays for the uh delivery of
 
04:37:38.209 --> 04:37:38.219 align:start position:0%
children that are not married with the
 
04:37:40.490 --> 04:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
parents of the girl or
 
04:37:42.051 --> 04:37:42.061 align:start position:0%
you know where does where does Insurance
 
04:37:44.869 --> 04:37:44.879 align:start position:0%
play into this um
 
04:37:48.529 --> 04:37:48.539 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing do you know I am not
 
04:37:51.289 --> 04:37:51.299 align:start position:0%
a sure about the insurance because each
 
04:37:53.269 --> 04:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
insurance is so different from each
 
04:37:54.590 --> 04:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
other and we have so many insurance
 
04:37:57.109 --> 04:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
companies out there and each one has its
 
04:37:59.810 --> 04:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
own separate plan when it comes to child
 
04:38:04.310 --> 04:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
birth and pregnancy and I believe that
 
04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
there are Services out there that can
 
04:38:08.929 --> 04:38:08.939 align:start position:0%
help expecting mothers help them find
 
04:38:11.750 --> 04:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
the help that they need with that okay
 
04:38:13.849 --> 04:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:13.859 --> 04:38:16.070 align:start position:0%
thank you
foreign

04:38:16.070 --> 04:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:19.070 --> 04:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton for one more just
 
04:38:23.150 --> 04:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up to the Mr representative
 
04:38:23.160 --> 04:38:25.090 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up to the Mr representative
Grossman

04:38:25.090 --> 04:38:25.100 align:start position:0%
Grossman
 
04:38:27.830 --> 04:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
Bickford okay I'm sorry it's Frau
 
04:38:31.189 --> 04:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
Grossman and Mr Bickford got it got it
 
04:38:34.189 --> 04:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
all right most insurance companies well
 
04:38:38.330 --> 04:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
cover maternity policies so whether
 
04:38:40.131 --> 04:38:40.141 align:start position:0%
they're under their child their parent
 
04:38:42.131 --> 04:38:42.141 align:start position:0%
or whether they're under their spouse
 
04:38:45.769 --> 04:38:45.779 align:start position:0%
maternity is vastly covered
 
04:38:49.070 --> 04:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh if they have an insurance policy
 
04:38:49.080 --> 04:38:51.650 align:start position:0%
uh if they have an insurance policy
so

04:38:51.650 --> 04:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:53.869 --> 04:38:53.879 align:start position:0%
we're getting a bit off here
 
04:38:55.970 --> 04:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
um so thank you I see no more hands up
 
04:38:57.650 --> 04:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
that means doesn't mean there's no more
 
04:38:59.150 --> 04:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
hands up but I see no more hands up
 
04:39:01.250 --> 04:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you so much because we get a lot
 
04:39:02.631 --> 04:39:02.641 align:start position:0%
of people wanting to come up here most
 
04:39:05.150 --> 04:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
of them in favor of what you're doing so
 
04:39:07.670 --> 04:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you so much and
 
04:39:10.250 --> 04:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative

04:39:28.320 --> 04:39:29.390 align:start position:0%
know you did been doing this a little
while

04:39:29.390 --> 04:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
while
 
04:39:31.189 --> 04:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Ellen Reed
 
04:39:34.189 --> 04:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
I represent Newmarket and new Fields
 
04:39:38.750 --> 04:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
um and I am although apparently OLS has
 
04:39:40.850 --> 04:39:40.860 align:start position:0%
made some mistakes this year and I am
 
04:39:44.270 --> 04:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
not listed I am as I have always been a
 
04:39:46.190 --> 04:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this bill in fact I would
 
04:39:48.530 --> 04:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
like to start since so many we have so
 
04:39:51.350 --> 04:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
many new members this term with the
 
04:39:54.170 --> 04:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
history of this bill as a freshman in
 
04:39:56.270 --> 04:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
2017 I was approached right after
 
04:39:58.550 --> 04:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
election actually representative Reid we
 
04:40:00.050 --> 04:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
have a printout with all of the history
 
04:40:02.150 --> 04:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill in this committee okay but I
 
04:40:04.730 --> 04:40:04.740 align:start position:0%
I have like a little like personal if
 
04:40:06.288 --> 04:40:06.298 align:start position:0%
you want to do this you rehearse this
 
04:40:08.330 --> 04:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
well I didn't really well it's in my
 
04:40:11.030 --> 04:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
heart rehearsed in my heart Mr chair if
 
04:40:12.708 --> 04:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
you would permit me
 
04:40:14.448 --> 04:40:14.458 align:start position:0%
um I was approached by a 16 year old
 
04:40:17.030 --> 04:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
girl scout saying why are 13 year olds
 
04:40:18.590 --> 04:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
getting married in New Hampshire and
 
04:40:20.630 --> 04:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
will you put this in and I said I
 
04:40:23.630 --> 04:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely will now as a freshman and a
 
04:40:25.130 --> 04:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
veteran ended up putting in the bill but
 
04:40:29.750 --> 04:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
I was a co-sponsor that term and I need
 
04:40:32.208 --> 04:40:32.218 align:start position:0%
to be clear I don't know um how to put
 
04:40:33.948 --> 04:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
04:40:36.288 --> 04:40:36.298 align:start position:0%
speaker Jasper was the speaker
 
04:40:38.990 --> 04:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
I believe representative Welch was the
 
04:40:41.690 --> 04:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
chair in other words we were under
 
04:40:43.910 --> 04:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
Republican control not to be partisan or
 
04:40:46.788 --> 04:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
anything but just as a matter of fact in
 
04:40:49.430 --> 04:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
that term that bill bringing the age of
 
04:40:52.190 --> 04:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
marriage up to 18. it came to Child and
 
04:40:54.770 --> 04:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
Family Law it went to a subcommittee it
 
04:40:57.708 --> 04:40:57.718 align:start position:0%
was unanimously passed at 18 out of the
 
04:40:59.690 --> 04:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
subcommittee in Republican control it
 
04:41:01.788 --> 04:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
was unanimously passed out of the
 
04:41:05.170 --> 04:41:05.180 align:start position:0%
committee and on the floor on consent
 
04:41:08.090 --> 04:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
that year Under full Republican control
 
04:41:11.030 --> 04:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
it was pulled off of consent
 
04:41:12.890 --> 04:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
um I do want to at this point because of
 
04:41:15.530 --> 04:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
the the uh rationale that was given to
 
04:41:17.628 --> 04:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
pull it off consent uh address a couple
 
04:41:19.010 --> 04:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
of the questions that were asked that
 
04:41:20.628 --> 04:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
touched on that the first thing is
 
04:41:22.070 --> 04:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
Insurance one of the things that was
 
04:41:23.270 --> 04:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
talked about when it was pulled off
 
04:41:26.750 --> 04:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
consent was well what about military
 
04:41:30.350 --> 04:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
um people guys going off to war and and
 
04:41:34.010 --> 04:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
how would their uh belovs be covered for
 
04:41:36.470 --> 04:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
the in the child if they weren't married
 
04:41:38.930 --> 04:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
well in fact insurance does vary
 
04:41:40.610 --> 04:41:40.620 align:start position:0%
frequently and Military Insurance does
 
04:41:43.970 --> 04:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
in particular cover partners and also
 
04:41:46.910 --> 04:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
children so if you are a bylaw if you
 
04:41:48.830 --> 04:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
have a biological child on the way and
 
04:41:50.628 --> 04:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
you claim that as your child it doesn't
 
04:41:53.868 --> 04:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
matter if you're married or not that
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
that child is covered secondly to answer
 
04:41:59.150 --> 04:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
more fully that original question
 
04:42:01.610 --> 04:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
um it's federal law that people have to
 
04:42:03.050 --> 04:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
be covered under their parents Insurance
 
04:42:06.170 --> 04:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
until the age of 27. So that obviously
 
04:42:08.510 --> 04:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
goes past 18.
 
04:42:08.520 --> 04:42:10.310 align:start position:0%
goes past 18.
also

04:42:10.310 --> 04:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:42:11.628 --> 04:42:11.638 align:start position:0%
um we could have been at that point the
 
04:42:14.570 --> 04:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
first state to to make this a law 18
 
04:42:17.570 --> 04:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
year old marriage just like that in that
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
but we weren't
 
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
um and now some other states have done
 
04:42:22.490 --> 04:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
it but in that very year that previous
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
year in my town of Newmarket there was a
 
04:42:28.430 --> 04:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
13 year old girl who was coerced by her
 
04:42:31.490 --> 04:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
parents to marry her 17 year old abuser
 
04:42:33.708 --> 04:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
they later got divorced because he was
 
04:42:36.170 --> 04:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
abusive but the point is is that this
 
04:42:38.868 --> 04:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
does happen it's not only kind of the
 
04:42:41.510 --> 04:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
extreme examples of a predatory older
 
04:42:43.368 --> 04:42:43.378 align:start position:0%
man but just
 
04:42:45.948 --> 04:42:45.958 align:start position:0%
parents coercing their child into doing
 
04:42:47.330 --> 04:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
something that isn't in the child's best
 
04:42:47.340 --> 04:42:48.410 align:start position:0%
something that isn't in the child's best
interest

04:42:48.410 --> 04:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
interest
 
04:42:51.368 --> 04:42:51.378 align:start position:0%
it has been stated before
 
04:42:54.230 --> 04:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
that a nowhere in the legal universe is
 
04:42:56.390 --> 04:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
a signature of a minor worth the hill of
 
04:42:58.128 --> 04:42:58.138 align:start position:0%
beans it's worth repeating that over and
 
04:43:01.970 --> 04:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
over again because to emancipation the
 
04:43:04.430 --> 04:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
following year we did put in a bill and
 
04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's where that partial emancipation
 
04:43:08.690 --> 04:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
comes in but it's worth noting that
 
04:43:10.850 --> 04:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
emancipation is a legal thing it doesn't
 
04:43:13.670 --> 04:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's not binding to companies so if you
 
04:43:16.430 --> 04:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
are a car rental company or you are a
 
04:43:18.530 --> 04:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
landlord you don't have to rent to a 16
 
04:43:19.910 --> 04:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
year old
 
04:43:21.650 --> 04:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
you don't
 
04:43:23.270 --> 04:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter that they're legally
 
04:43:25.010 --> 04:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
emancipated and consign something you
 
04:43:26.810 --> 04:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
you're not forced into renting to them
 
04:43:29.570 --> 04:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
so just because you
 
04:43:31.430 --> 04:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
um there's some partial emancipation
 
04:43:32.868 --> 04:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
that we were able to get the following
 
04:43:35.510 --> 04:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
year it doesn't actually protect a 16
 
04:43:37.788 --> 04:43:37.798 align:start position:0%
year old who wants to leave
 
04:43:41.570 --> 04:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
another piece of legal problem that that
 
04:43:44.090 --> 04:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
this has caused is when we did and this
 
04:43:46.070 --> 04:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
is before I ever became a rep actually a
 
04:43:48.770 --> 04:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
couple years before we passed same-sex
 
04:43:50.990 --> 04:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
marriage as you know when we passed
 
04:43:54.128 --> 04:43:54.138 align:start position:0%
same-sex marriage we passed it at 18
 
04:43:56.570 --> 04:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
which now means that we have a
 
04:44:00.110 --> 04:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
discriminatory law on the books which we
 
04:44:02.628 --> 04:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
have already said in our laws we cannot
 
04:44:04.550 --> 04:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
be discriminatory on the basis of sexual
 
04:44:06.948 --> 04:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
orientation but it has become de facto
 
04:44:09.708 --> 04:44:09.718 align:start position:0%
the problem that we have already made
 
04:44:12.050 --> 04:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
same-sex marriage only legal we are
 
04:44:14.330 --> 04:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
providing protection for same-sex
 
04:44:17.570 --> 04:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
couples children up until the age of 18
 
04:44:19.010 --> 04:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
but we're not providing that same
 
04:44:22.610 --> 04:44:22.620 align:start position:0%
protection for heterosexual children and
 
04:44:23.690 --> 04:44:23.700 align:start position:0%
also call them children because they're
 
04:44:26.330 --> 04:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
still under 18.
 
04:44:29.030 --> 04:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
um so yes in general if you're under 18
 
04:44:30.708 --> 04:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
you cannot give consent your signature
 
04:44:33.708 --> 04:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean anything back to the minds
 
04:44:35.330 --> 04:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
not developing piece that's a very
 
04:44:36.890 --> 04:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
important piece not only has your mind
 
04:44:39.288 --> 04:44:39.298 align:start position:0%
not developed and I would say that
 
04:44:40.970 --> 04:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
subcommittee where was unanimous under
 
04:44:43.310 --> 04:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
Republican control that subcommittee I
 
04:44:45.230 --> 04:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
listened to that entire subcommittee and
 
04:44:47.390 --> 04:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
they said if we could bring this to 25
 
04:44:50.448 --> 04:44:50.458 align:start position:0%
and bring everything to 25 we would
 
04:44:52.490 --> 04:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
because that's when the brain is finally
 
04:44:54.650 --> 04:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
done developing but since we're not
 
04:44:57.470 --> 04:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
looking to change the age of voting
 
04:45:01.128 --> 04:45:01.138 align:start position:0%
smoking drinking and everything else 18
 
04:45:02.510 --> 04:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
is where they settled because that's
 
04:45:04.850 --> 04:45:04.860 align:start position:0%
where everything else is set
 
04:45:07.368 --> 04:45:07.378 align:start position:0%
um but your mind is not developed at 16
 
04:45:09.890 --> 04:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
but more than that your mind is still
 
04:45:13.368 --> 04:45:13.378 align:start position:0%
developing and if you are in a romantic
 
04:45:15.770 --> 04:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
and sexual relationship with who is in
 
04:45:17.750 --> 04:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
essence your guardian
 
04:45:20.750 --> 04:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
that messes up your mental development
 
04:45:24.350 --> 04:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
at the age of 16. and that is why we are
 
04:45:26.750 --> 04:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
seeing the data that Cassie introduced
 
04:45:29.750 --> 04:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
increased rates of abuse physical abuse
 
04:45:32.570 --> 04:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
mental illness poverty substance abuse
 
04:45:34.490 --> 04:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
lower rates of Education
 
04:45:36.530 --> 04:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
now it's true of 18 year olds as well of
 
04:45:38.448 --> 04:45:38.458 align:start position:0%
course but why are we why are we
 
04:45:40.850 --> 04:45:40.860 align:start position:0%
exacerbating the problem by including 16
 
04:45:42.708 --> 04:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
and 17 year olds
 
04:45:44.510 --> 04:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
04:45:46.670 --> 04:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
um and the fact remains it is still used
 
04:45:48.590 --> 04:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
to paper over human trafficking there is
 
04:45:51.050 --> 04:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
a rather notorious example although
 
04:45:52.730 --> 04:45:52.740 align:start position:0%
there have been multiple ones that I
 
04:45:54.368 --> 04:45:54.378 align:start position:0%
could talk about but one in Florida
 
04:45:57.050 --> 04:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
recently where I think it was probably
 
04:45:58.970 --> 04:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
so famous because it was a pastor in his
 
04:46:02.390 --> 04:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
40s late 40s who impregnated I believe a
 
04:46:05.930 --> 04:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
nine-year-old and the parents uh
 
04:46:08.208 --> 04:46:08.218 align:start position:0%
coerce the child into marrying him at
 
04:46:10.128 --> 04:46:10.138 align:start position:0%
the age of 10. and that only happened in
 
04:46:13.150 --> 04:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
the last few years also there are other
 
04:46:16.850 --> 04:46:16.860 align:start position:0%
notable famous people who have papered
 
04:46:16.860 --> 04:46:17.590 align:start position:0%
notable famous people who have papered
over

04:46:17.590 --> 04:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:46:20.628 --> 04:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
these abusive inherently abusive
 
04:46:22.190 --> 04:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
relationships I mean that in the sense
 
04:46:22.200 --> 04:46:23.350 align:start position:0%
relationships I mean that in the sense
of

04:46:23.350 --> 04:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:46:25.850 --> 04:46:25.860 align:start position:0%
the people that they were in
 
04:46:27.948 --> 04:46:27.958 align:start position:0%
relationship with were not of
 
04:46:30.650 --> 04:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
appropriate age and they papered over in
 
04:46:32.990 --> 04:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
these cases by becoming their Guardians
 
04:46:35.270 --> 04:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
first which is the situation you get
 
04:46:36.948 --> 04:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
when you don't have a fully emancipated
 
04:46:40.788 --> 04:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
person married to somebody who is of age
 
04:46:43.730 --> 04:46:43.740 align:start position:0%
is they are in effect you're a guardian
 
04:46:45.650 --> 04:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
in some way you're still going to school
 
04:46:46.910 --> 04:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
if you're still going to school
 
04:46:49.250 --> 04:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
potentially and you go on a field trip
 
04:46:50.448 --> 04:46:50.458 align:start position:0%
who are you going to get to sign your
 
04:46:53.330 --> 04:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
permission slip your husband
 
04:46:56.270 --> 04:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's a problem so these famous people
 
04:46:58.310 --> 04:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
who've done this we're going to need to
 
04:47:00.890 --> 04:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
wrap this up yes Mr chair you're right
 
04:47:03.410 --> 04:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
I'm very close to being done uh Grover
 
04:47:05.810 --> 04:47:05.820 align:start position:0%
Cleveland became an official guardian of
 
04:47:07.670 --> 04:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
the person he eventually married Steve
 
04:47:10.250 --> 04:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
Tyler became the official guardian of
 
04:47:11.990 --> 04:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
someone he ended up in a sexual
 
04:47:14.150 --> 04:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
relationship with and prince prince is
 
04:47:16.010 --> 04:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
the one that hurts me the most became
 
04:47:19.250 --> 04:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
the actual official Guardian
 
04:47:22.128 --> 04:47:22.138 align:start position:0%
um Prince yes he became the official
 
04:47:23.810 --> 04:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
guardian of a 17 year old I know I it
 
04:47:25.368 --> 04:47:25.378 align:start position:0%
hurt my it broke my heart to find that
 
04:47:26.750 --> 04:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
out as well
 
04:47:28.910 --> 04:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
and so this the point of this is that
 
04:47:31.910 --> 04:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
parents can and are convinced for a
 
04:47:34.430 --> 04:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of different reasons to
 
04:47:36.770 --> 04:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
coerce their child into going and
 
04:47:38.990 --> 04:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
getting into a marriage whether it's
 
04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
their poor and a rich person comes into
 
04:47:42.350 --> 04:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
their lives and say hey I'll give your
 
04:47:45.530 --> 04:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
child the best that there is to offer or
 
04:47:48.530 --> 04:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
the child gets pregnant and the the
 
04:47:50.330 --> 04:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
parents think well maybe it's best that
 
04:47:51.830 --> 04:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
they are taken care of by somebody else
 
04:47:53.590 --> 04:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason
 
04:47:56.448 --> 04:47:56.458 align:start position:0%
a couple other uh on that notorious day
 
04:47:58.368 --> 04:47:58.378 align:start position:0%
when it was pulled off consent one of
 
04:48:00.410 --> 04:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
the other arguments was the idea of
 
04:48:00.420 --> 04:48:01.490 align:start position:0%
the other arguments was the idea of
religion

04:48:01.490 --> 04:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
religion
 
04:48:05.330 --> 04:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
there is no major religion that forces a
 
04:48:07.490 --> 04:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
person to marry someone under the age
 
04:48:09.890 --> 04:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
under the age of majority a child to
 
04:48:11.570 --> 04:48:11.580 align:start position:0%
Mary no major religion there are
 
04:48:13.310 --> 04:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
religions that say that you should not
 
04:48:15.350 --> 04:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
have sex before marriage but you've kind
 
04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
of missed the boat on that if they're
 
04:48:19.670 --> 04:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
already pregnant so you can't just kind
 
04:48:22.310 --> 04:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
of like retroactively undo the what you
 
04:48:24.230 --> 04:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
believe to be a sin just because you get
 
04:48:26.448 --> 04:48:26.458 align:start position:0%
married literally no major religion and
 
04:48:29.330 --> 04:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
I did minor in religious studies says
 
04:48:32.030 --> 04:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
that you have to get married
 
04:48:35.208 --> 04:48:35.218 align:start position:0%
um as a minor and I did mention the same
 
04:48:36.830 --> 04:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
sex discrimination thing and the
 
04:48:38.150 --> 04:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
insurance thing so I think I got through
 
04:48:39.530 --> 04:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
all my notes and I really appreciate
 
04:48:41.570 --> 04:48:41.580 align:start position:0%
your time questions for the
 
04:48:44.208 --> 04:48:44.218 align:start position:0%
representative you know the gist of what
 
04:48:46.128 --> 04:48:46.138 align:start position:0%
you were saying earlier on about how
 
04:48:48.050 --> 04:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
this Republican committee did this in
 
04:48:49.970 --> 04:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
the Republic is one of your points that
 
04:48:51.970 --> 04:48:51.980 align:start position:0%
we all should vote Republican
 
04:48:54.410 --> 04:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
you know what's funny is that I think
 
04:48:55.670 --> 04:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
that that might have come across that
 
04:48:58.190 --> 04:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
way upstairs earlier
 
04:49:01.490 --> 04:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
an election law committee uh no but I
 
04:49:03.530 --> 04:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
think the point the real point of that
 
04:49:05.810 --> 04:49:05.820 align:start position:0%
statement was this should not be
 
04:49:08.270 --> 04:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
partisan and I think like many many that
 
04:49:10.970 --> 04:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
illustrates that many things in this
 
04:49:12.410 --> 04:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
world that we're living in now have
 
04:49:14.330 --> 04:49:14.340 align:start position:0%
unfortunately become partisan but there
 
04:49:16.310 --> 04:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
was a time where this was absolutely not
 
04:49:18.590 --> 04:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
partisan before it became partisan
 
04:49:20.330 --> 04:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought you meant thank
 
04:49:21.830 --> 04:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair
 
04:49:24.170 --> 04:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
04:49:33.170 --> 04:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:35.270 --> 04:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I'm going to
 
04:49:36.948 --> 04:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
stick to my written comments because I
 
04:49:39.230 --> 04:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
know they're under three minutes
 
04:49:40.850 --> 04:49:40.860 align:start position:0%
um but I want to thank you all this for
 
04:49:42.590 --> 04:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to speak to you today
 
04:49:45.770 --> 04:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
on HB 34. for the record my name is
 
04:49:47.628 --> 04:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
representative Rosemarie wrong from
 
04:49:49.730 --> 04:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough 12 which is the town of
 
04:49:49.740 --> 04:49:50.990 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough 12 which is the town of
Merrimack

04:49:50.990 --> 04:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
Merrimack
 
04:49:53.090 --> 04:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
versions of this bill as you know have
 
04:49:55.010 --> 04:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
come before this committee and the prime
 
04:49:57.770 --> 04:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Levick has done a
 
04:50:00.050 --> 04:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
thorough job in presenting the facts and
 
04:50:02.390 --> 04:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
exposing the damage to girls from child
 
04:50:04.490 --> 04:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
marriage so I'm not going to repeat any
 
04:50:08.150 --> 04:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
of that I'm here as a co-sponsor who was
 
04:50:09.530 --> 04:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
left off the bill
 
04:50:13.788 --> 04:50:13.798 align:start position:0%
because like you as a legislator I feel
 
04:50:16.190 --> 04:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
the need for our decisions to reflect
 
04:50:18.410 --> 04:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
Granite State values
 
04:50:20.930 --> 04:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
one of the greatest values is individual
 
04:50:20.940 --> 04:50:22.070 align:start position:0%
one of the greatest values is individual
freedom

04:50:22.070 --> 04:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
freedom
 
04:50:24.708 --> 04:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
after all our motto is Live Free or Die
 
04:50:27.730 --> 04:50:27.740 align:start position:0%
it conjures up images of
 
04:50:30.530 --> 04:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
self-determination and the power of one
 
04:50:33.530 --> 04:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
person to control their destiny
 
04:50:36.590 --> 04:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
but if this is really true how can we
 
04:50:40.128 --> 04:50:40.138 align:start position:0%
tolerate a person even just one
 
04:50:42.590 --> 04:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
entering into a lifelong commitment
 
04:50:45.110 --> 04:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
which is solely dependent on the
 
04:50:47.150 --> 04:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
decisions of others
 
04:50:49.670 --> 04:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
every other person in New Hampshire can
 
04:50:52.550 --> 04:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
marry without the parents approval and
 
04:50:55.490 --> 04:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
without a judge's approval but 16 and 7
 
04:50:57.770 --> 04:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
year olds can't do that
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
why because they are too young to make
 
04:51:02.868 --> 04:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
the decisions for themselves
 
04:51:05.390 --> 04:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
and if they are too young to make it
 
04:51:07.730 --> 04:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
themselves then no one should make it
 
04:51:11.930 --> 04:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
for them and we must pass HP 34 we must
 
04:51:14.810 --> 04:51:14.820 align:start position:0%
respect that a minor is too young to
 
04:51:17.570 --> 04:51:17.580 align:start position:0%
make the decision on their own
 
04:51:20.090 --> 04:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
they're too young to shoulder the burden
 
04:51:23.868 --> 04:51:23.878 align:start position:0%
and responsibility of marriage 16 and 17
 
04:51:27.890 --> 04:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
year olds are minors for a reason
 
04:51:31.250 --> 04:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
to continue their education to complete
 
04:51:33.590 --> 04:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
their adolescence and to gain life
 
04:51:36.288 --> 04:51:36.298 align:start position:0%
experiences to shape their goals and
 
04:51:39.470 --> 04:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
dreams which may or may not result in
 
04:51:41.330 --> 04:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
the decision to marry
 
04:51:44.810 --> 04:51:44.820 align:start position:0%
passing HB 34 gives minors the extra
 
04:51:47.390 --> 04:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
years to develop and self-determine
 
04:51:50.570 --> 04:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
their future without requiring others to
 
04:51:53.090 --> 04:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
approve a decision that should solely be
 
04:51:53.100 --> 04:51:54.410 align:start position:0%
approve a decision that should solely be
theirs

04:51:54.410 --> 04:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
theirs
 
04:51:57.050 --> 04:51:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time I think I'm well
 
04:51:59.208 --> 04:51:59.218 align:start position:0%
under my five minutes but I'd be happy
 
04:52:01.730 --> 04:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions you have any
 
04:52:04.430 --> 04:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
questions for representative run
 
04:52:08.270 --> 04:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
great okay thank you
 
04:52:17.810 --> 04:52:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:19.550 --> 04:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
here I am again
 
04:52:21.530 --> 04:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again Sebastian Fuentes
 
04:52:23.270 --> 04:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh movement politics director of horizon
 
04:52:26.150 --> 04:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
democracy and I'm here on my capacity of
 
04:52:28.250 --> 04:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
um a parent you know I have a 17 year
 
04:52:31.070 --> 04:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
old I have an 11 year old of a
 
04:52:33.230 --> 04:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
three-year-old who steps on is seven
 
04:52:34.788 --> 04:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
years old and I have a daughter that is
 
04:52:37.190 --> 04:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
almost almost two so
 
04:52:39.110 --> 04:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
um no I'm here to support this bill
 
04:52:41.390 --> 04:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
because I don't think uh
 
04:52:44.750 --> 04:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
16 is actually at appropriate age to uh
 
04:52:47.330 --> 04:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
to to get married you know also I also
 
04:52:48.770 --> 04:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
for about 20 years I worked in the
 
04:52:51.948 --> 04:52:51.958 align:start position:0%
hospitality industry and and I I noticed
 
04:52:55.070 --> 04:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh at that age I'm 16 years old
 
04:52:56.510 --> 04:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of limitations on how
 
04:52:58.750 --> 04:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
much work you can do so if you can work
 
04:53:01.310 --> 04:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
if you can award your 40 hours if you
 
04:53:02.510 --> 04:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
cannot make money who's going to support
 
04:53:04.610 --> 04:53:04.620 align:start position:0%
the family you know and if you have a
 
04:53:05.810 --> 04:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
child who's going to support that child
 
04:53:07.550 --> 04:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
you know if it happened to me I'm pretty
 
04:53:09.110 --> 04:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
sure it's going to be
 
04:53:11.810 --> 04:53:11.820 align:start position:0%
me if that was the case so I'm just here
 
04:53:14.150 --> 04:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
really quick briefly to just uh support
 
04:53:16.910 --> 04:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
this bill because I think uh 1617 is not
 
04:53:18.708 --> 04:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
an appropriate age to to get married
 
04:53:22.550 --> 04:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
about uh 18 maybe but still it's better
 
04:53:25.910 --> 04:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
than the 16 years old thank you so much
 
04:53:28.190 --> 04:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:53:31.368 --> 04:53:31.378 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:53:33.590 --> 04:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Jess
 
04:53:33.600 --> 04:53:46.670 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Jess
Edwards

04:53:46.670 --> 04:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:46.680 --> 04:53:49.610 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

04:53:49.610 --> 04:53:49.620 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
04:53:51.770 --> 04:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair
 
04:53:53.570 --> 04:53:53.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going to stalk you and
 
04:53:55.310 --> 04:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
follow you around to every committee you
 
04:53:58.430 --> 04:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
run that's sort of my strategy we both
 
04:54:01.208 --> 04:54:01.218 align:start position:0%
got reappointed to oversight
 
04:54:04.250 --> 04:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm representative Jess Edwards I
 
04:54:06.470 --> 04:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
represent Rockingham District 31 that's
 
04:54:11.208 --> 04:54:11.218 align:start position:0%
Auburn candy uh Chester and Deerfield I
 
04:54:13.190 --> 04:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
put five minutes on the card I may run
 
04:54:17.030 --> 04:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
just a little long uh in in that and my
 
04:54:18.708 --> 04:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
rationale for maybe running a little
 
04:54:21.830 --> 04:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
long is I think I'm on the blue sheet
 
04:54:23.990 --> 04:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'm the only one in favor of marriage
 
04:54:27.708 --> 04:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
I'm a advocate of the institution
 
04:54:30.350 --> 04:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
well I'm I'm an advocate for the
 
04:54:32.990 --> 04:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
institution of marriage and
 
04:54:37.610 --> 04:54:37.620 align:start position:0%
um I was married uh 41 years we met at a
 
04:54:40.730 --> 04:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
very tender age the commitment to my
 
04:54:44.510 --> 04:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
bride never wavered uh so
 
04:54:48.230 --> 04:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
um I I would like to point out since the
 
04:54:50.330 --> 04:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
talk about pulling things off of consent
 
04:54:53.150 --> 04:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
was mentioned earlier by representative
 
04:54:55.430 --> 04:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
Reed as one of the people that helped
 
04:54:58.788 --> 04:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
pull that off of consent and convince a
 
04:55:00.650 --> 04:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
majority of the people on in the house
 
04:55:03.890 --> 04:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
that it was a bad bill and when it came
 
04:55:07.250 --> 04:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
back and and on a very rare instance of
 
04:55:09.350 --> 04:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
a consent pulling something off of
 
04:55:11.930 --> 04:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
consent getting flipped this this was
 
04:55:14.150 --> 04:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
kind of a highlight for me because it
 
04:55:18.470 --> 04:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
was a bad Bill it banned up to the age
 
04:55:20.288 --> 04:55:20.298 align:start position:0%
of 18.
 
04:55:22.730 --> 04:55:22.740 align:start position:0%
when it came back
 
04:55:26.690 --> 04:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
it ended up that um the house a majority
 
04:55:29.208 --> 04:55:29.218 align:start position:0%
of the house and the Senate agreed to
 
04:55:32.868 --> 04:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
prohibit marriage at 14 and 15. we kept
 
04:55:35.830 --> 04:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
the age at 16 17
 
04:55:39.708 --> 04:55:39.718 align:start position:0%
intentionally I think because we
 
04:55:42.910 --> 04:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
recognized the science of biology
 
04:55:46.448 --> 04:55:46.458 align:start position:0%
that our law on consent
 
04:55:50.030 --> 04:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
happens to be in line with and that when
 
04:55:53.628 --> 04:55:53.638 align:start position:0%
individuals begin to engage in sexual
 
04:55:59.570 --> 04:55:59.580 align:start position:0%
Congress a baby is often produced when
 
04:56:02.448 --> 04:56:02.458 align:start position:0%
that baby is produced as we all know a
 
04:56:07.550 --> 04:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
tremendous responsibility is created
 
04:56:09.788 --> 04:56:09.798 align:start position:0%
um there are still a great many people
 
04:56:13.368 --> 04:56:13.378 align:start position:0%
even at a tender age when pregnant would
 
04:56:15.590 --> 04:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
want to keep that baby and raise the
 
04:56:19.190 --> 04:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
baby and for those people I take a look
 
04:56:22.010 --> 04:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
at their individual right to
 
04:56:23.990 --> 04:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
self-determination and I don't I don't
 
04:56:27.350 --> 04:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
want us to skip past this because what
 
04:56:30.830 --> 04:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is its stereotypes
 
04:56:33.890 --> 04:56:33.900 align:start position:0%
and blankets and wraps of net around all
 
04:56:36.550 --> 04:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
people of a particular age demographic
 
04:56:39.770 --> 04:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
regardless of the individual's desires
 
04:56:43.490 --> 04:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
and intent and capability and so we so
 
04:56:47.090 --> 04:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
we go from a state where we say Live
 
04:56:49.730 --> 04:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
Free or Die to a state where we
 
04:56:52.730 --> 04:56:52.740 align:start position:0%
eliminate an individual right to follow
 
04:56:56.948 --> 04:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
up on their natural biology
 
04:56:59.570 --> 04:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
so I
 
04:57:02.750 --> 04:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
I would I would point out that
 
04:57:02.760 --> 04:57:04.208 align:start position:0%
I would I would point out that
um

04:57:04.208 --> 04:57:04.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:06.948 --> 04:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
we've talked in the past when this bill
 
04:57:08.890 --> 04:57:08.900 align:start position:0%
has come up about the military
 
04:57:12.288 --> 04:57:12.298 align:start position:0%
and I I know having been in the military
 
04:57:14.750 --> 04:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
for 33 years and having had young
 
04:57:19.730 --> 04:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
soldiers uh in my commands that there
 
04:57:21.530 --> 04:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
are times where a young Soldier will
 
04:57:24.470 --> 04:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
choose to marry his Young Bride and
 
04:57:28.190 --> 04:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
bring her and any children into a
 
04:57:30.410 --> 04:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
military family
 
04:57:32.990 --> 04:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
um and because the military treats its
 
04:57:37.550 --> 04:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
families as part of the unit and and and
 
04:57:39.830 --> 04:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
and and the institution of marriage is
 
04:57:42.590 --> 04:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
there to uh they don't get insurance as
 
04:57:44.930 --> 04:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
much as they get uh eligibility or
 
04:57:47.810 --> 04:57:47.820 align:start position:0%
medical hospital to come in
 
04:57:50.690 --> 04:57:50.700 align:start position:0%
um if if I think the military argument
 
04:57:54.470 --> 04:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
is still that if a father or mother is
 
04:57:56.930 --> 04:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
killed in combat and they've been
 
04:57:58.730 --> 04:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
married to the spouse and the child
 
04:58:01.970 --> 04:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
comes from that the psychology of it is
 
04:58:04.730 --> 04:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
is that the children tend to be very
 
04:58:07.490 --> 04:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
much better adjusted if they knew that
 
04:58:11.530 --> 04:58:11.540 align:start position:0%
they were brought in to the world
 
04:58:15.050 --> 04:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
through a process of recognizing and
 
04:58:17.448 --> 04:58:17.458 align:start position:0%
committing to their love the the the the
 
04:58:19.490 --> 04:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
other arguments that have been mentioned
 
04:58:22.070 --> 04:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
here about high rates of domestic
 
04:58:24.708 --> 04:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
violence I I think it was even mentioned
 
04:58:28.310 --> 04:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
higher rates of HIV and AIDS higher
 
04:58:31.430 --> 04:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
rates of divorce I I think I think these
 
04:58:32.930 --> 04:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
are just general and I think the chair
 
04:58:34.430 --> 04:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned this I think these are just
 
04:58:36.948 --> 04:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
basically uh attacks on the institution
 
04:58:38.750 --> 04:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
of marriage itself there's nothing that
 
04:58:40.490 --> 04:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
was in that testimony that
 
04:58:42.530 --> 04:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
differentiated that based on an age
 
04:58:45.110 --> 04:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
difference that the these bad bad
 
04:58:47.628 --> 04:58:47.638 align:start position:0%
negative things are more likely to
 
04:58:50.390 --> 04:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
happen I I sort of believe in love still
 
04:58:53.090 --> 04:58:53.100 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of a crazy guy that way and I
 
04:58:55.730 --> 04:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
think if two people find themselves
 
04:58:58.850 --> 04:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
um uh early uh that that it's entirely
 
04:59:00.948 --> 04:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
possible to commit to it I'm reminded of
 
04:59:02.868 --> 04:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
representative Harry Bean who many of
 
04:59:06.050 --> 04:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
you know who he and his wife met at the
 
04:59:08.270 --> 04:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
age of 15 and 16 and were married
 
04:59:11.448 --> 04:59:11.458 align:start position:0%
shortly thereafter and after 50 years of
 
04:59:13.010 --> 04:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
marriage they're still kicking around
 
04:59:17.350 --> 04:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
and they're together so so we we we we
 
04:59:21.650 --> 04:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
can't wrap this net of State control
 
04:59:24.708 --> 04:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
over this entire demographic and treat
 
04:59:28.610 --> 04:59:28.620 align:start position:0%
them as a unified group of people these
 
04:59:31.368 --> 04:59:31.378 align:start position:0%
are all individuals trying to live their
 
04:59:31.378 --> 04:59:32.690 align:start position:0%
are all individuals trying to live their
lives

04:59:32.690 --> 04:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
lives
 
04:59:35.448 --> 04:59:35.458 align:start position:0%
so let's say let's go back to the
 
04:59:38.810 --> 04:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
pregnancy at the age of 16 or 17 after
 
04:59:41.690 --> 04:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
the state has you know blessed the the
 
04:59:45.650 --> 04:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
the conduct of sexual intercourse and
 
04:59:49.730 --> 04:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
and and and the pregnancy exists if this
 
04:59:52.970 --> 04:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
HP 34 were in place let's think about
 
04:59:55.730 --> 04:59:55.740 align:start position:0%
this from the couple's perspective we
 
04:59:58.430 --> 04:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
can't get married the state has taken a
 
05:00:01.010 --> 05:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
position that bans us from getting
 
05:00:03.910 --> 05:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
married much like we ban you know
 
05:00:07.368 --> 05:00:07.378 align:start position:0%
huffing toxic Vapors we've banned
 
05:00:10.490 --> 05:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
marriage as something that we perceived
 
05:00:12.830 --> 05:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
to be toxic and I disagree with that so
 
05:00:14.930 --> 05:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
what does what kind of choices do they
 
05:00:17.690 --> 05:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
have well I think this turns out to be a
 
05:00:19.190 --> 05:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
pro-abortion bill
 
05:00:22.070 --> 05:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
because if they don't have the option to
 
05:00:24.050 --> 05:00:24.060 align:start position:0%
get married then they got to start
 
05:00:25.850 --> 05:00:25.860 align:start position:0%
looking at other ways of handling their
 
05:00:28.190 --> 05:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
life circumstance and all of a sudden we
 
05:00:31.310 --> 05:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
make abortion very easy uh and and
 
05:00:33.110 --> 05:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
that's just social policy in New
 
05:00:36.230 --> 05:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so all of a sudden abortion uh
 
05:00:38.750 --> 05:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
gets to be a good option if they choose
 
05:00:40.550 --> 05:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
to carry the baby to term it was
 
05:00:42.890 --> 05:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier about Medicaid so so
 
05:00:44.810 --> 05:00:44.820 align:start position:0%
without the benefit of marriage the
 
05:00:46.850 --> 05:00:46.860 align:start position:0%
propensity of going on Medicaid and
 
05:00:48.530 --> 05:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
Welfare and other types of social
 
05:00:51.770 --> 05:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
support uh increase it has the state
 
05:00:53.570 --> 05:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
basically saying hey you can't get
 
05:00:54.948 --> 05:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
married we're going to act like your
 
05:00:57.050 --> 05:00:57.060 align:start position:0%
parent we're going to take care of you
 
05:00:59.090 --> 05:00:59.100 align:start position:0%
as though we were your parents and I
 
05:01:00.550 --> 05:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
don't think that's the role of the state
 
05:01:03.050 --> 05:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
the other option is to go find a
 
05:01:04.850 --> 05:01:04.860 align:start position:0%
sanctuary State we've talked about we've
 
05:01:07.010 --> 05:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
heard about Sanctuary States so why
 
05:01:08.448 --> 05:01:08.458 align:start position:0%
wouldn't there be a sanctuary state
 
05:01:11.930 --> 05:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
where kids this age can go off and get
 
05:01:13.910 --> 05:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
married and come back to New Hampshire
 
05:01:16.610 --> 05:01:16.620 align:start position:0%
with the benefit of a marriage granted
 
05:01:20.090 --> 05:01:20.100 align:start position:0%
by another state and under federal law
 
05:01:22.430 --> 05:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would be obligated to
 
05:01:24.830 --> 05:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
recognize the sanctity of that marriage
 
05:01:27.948 --> 05:01:27.958 align:start position:0%
so all we're doing is saying hey Drive
 
05:01:30.590 --> 05:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
15 miles or whatever to go to Vermont or
 
05:01:32.868 --> 05:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
Maine and get married and come back and
 
05:01:34.850 --> 05:01:34.860 align:start position:0%
the state is irrelevant we've done
 
05:01:37.788 --> 05:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
something ugly to you but don't worry
 
05:01:39.530 --> 05:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
we're irrelevant because you can cross
 
05:01:42.110 --> 05:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
state lines and get this taken care of
 
05:01:44.150 --> 05:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
in the old days when I was young we
 
05:01:45.650 --> 05:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
would call this shacking up that's
 
05:01:47.990 --> 05:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
another option you could just choose to
 
05:01:49.610 --> 05:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
live with each other without the benefit
 
05:01:53.030 --> 05:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
of of marriage and I you know I don't
 
05:01:55.670 --> 05:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
know there are advantages to that option
 
05:01:59.570 --> 05:01:59.580 align:start position:0%
but I would encourage the the people to
 
05:02:02.448 --> 05:02:02.458 align:start position:0%
seriously think through the the benefits
 
05:02:05.030 --> 05:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
of stability that come with the with
 
05:02:07.788 --> 05:02:07.798 align:start position:0%
marriage so uh so we if we take away
 
05:02:10.368 --> 05:02:10.378 align:start position:0%
marriage as an option we're putting in
 
05:02:13.128 --> 05:02:13.138 align:start position:0%
its place choices of abortion welfare
 
05:02:16.610 --> 05:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
running away to Sanctuary States just
 
05:02:19.368 --> 05:02:19.378 align:start position:0%
living in sin no it's not sin I mean
 
05:02:20.230 --> 05:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
come on
 
05:02:22.970 --> 05:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
that's a euphemism I don't actually mean
 
05:02:26.510 --> 05:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
that but but you know what I'm saying
 
05:02:30.050 --> 05:02:30.060 align:start position:0%
um we're giving we cannot control their
 
05:02:32.270 --> 05:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
behavior even though this bill is trying
 
05:02:34.430 --> 05:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
to control their behavior what we can do
 
05:02:37.368 --> 05:02:37.378 align:start position:0%
is we can limit their options and force
 
05:02:39.530 --> 05:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
them to take other options that are not
 
05:02:42.770 --> 05:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
as attractive I don't think so I guess
 
05:02:46.490 --> 05:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
in summary I would say
 
05:02:48.110 --> 05:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
we need to think of this as an
 
05:02:50.690 --> 05:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
individual Freedom issue how many people
 
05:02:52.610 --> 05:02:52.620 align:start position:0%
have been married since the the bill
 
05:02:56.390 --> 05:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
eliminated the ability of 14 and 15 year
 
05:02:58.128 --> 05:02:58.138 align:start position:0%
olds to get married I I think we've
 
05:03:00.530 --> 05:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
heard five and five years I don't I it
 
05:03:01.970 --> 05:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
was hard because I we heard different
 
05:03:04.670 --> 05:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
numbers in different contexts so this is
 
05:03:07.190 --> 05:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
not a huge problem the problems that we
 
05:03:10.730 --> 05:03:10.740 align:start position:0%
heard are historical you know the Grover
 
05:03:12.948 --> 05:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
Cleveland for God's sake I mean that
 
05:03:14.628 --> 05:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
didn't even happen in New Hampshire the
 
05:03:17.270 --> 05:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
the the the the situation down in
 
05:03:19.070 --> 05:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
Florida with a nine-year-old that that's
 
05:03:21.050 --> 05:03:21.060 align:start position:0%
not New Hampshire and Florida does crazy
 
05:03:23.570 --> 05:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
stuff all the time we're talking about
 
05:03:25.368 --> 05:03:25.378 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law we've already banned
 
05:03:27.650 --> 05:03:27.660 align:start position:0%
14 and 15 we're allowing the individual
 
05:03:30.230 --> 05:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
Freedom at this point for 16 and 17 year
 
05:03:33.350 --> 05:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
olds and if we were talking today about
 
05:03:39.288 --> 05:03:39.298 align:start position:0%
of 13 year olds ability to opt in to
 
05:03:42.170 --> 05:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
having puberty blockers this entire
 
05:03:44.090 --> 05:03:44.100 align:start position:0%
conversation would be flipped in an
 
05:03:47.030 --> 05:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
instant and you you all know it all
 
05:03:50.390 --> 05:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
right so um so let's try to achieve some
 
05:03:53.090 --> 05:03:53.100 align:start position:0%
consistency on the principles of
 
05:03:56.448 --> 05:03:56.458 align:start position:0%
individual freedom and and respect for
 
05:03:59.628 --> 05:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
an institution that's vital I think to
 
05:04:03.110 --> 05:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
providing social stability and and has
 
05:04:06.050 --> 05:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
the best opportunity I think of creating
 
05:04:08.810 --> 05:04:08.820 align:start position:0%
a safe and secure secure environment to
 
05:04:11.510 --> 05:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
raise kids to be productive
 
05:04:14.030 --> 05:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
um and um and really that's my testimony
 
05:04:15.590 --> 05:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
05:04:18.050 --> 05:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
05:04:20.288 --> 05:04:20.298 align:start position:0%

05:04:35.090 --> 05:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
um as a question with that you did speak
 
05:04:36.650 --> 05:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
about the military and people getting
 
05:04:37.970 --> 05:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
married how important all that is to you
 
05:04:39.590 --> 05:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
do you know what the age is that you can
 
05:04:42.890 --> 05:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
legally uh sign up to be in the military
 
05:04:45.830 --> 05:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
well it's uh it's 18 on your own I think
 
05:04:48.590 --> 05:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
you can go down to 17. uh the age
 
05:04:50.868 --> 05:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
actually changes depending on the needs
 
05:04:52.788 --> 05:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
of the military and given they're in
 
05:04:54.770 --> 05:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
such a tough recruiting situation it may
 
05:04:57.170 --> 05:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
have been lowered but but the last I
 
05:04:59.868 --> 05:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
knew it was 17 with the parental consent
 
05:05:03.770 --> 05:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
and 18 with the on your own and uh and
 
05:05:06.350 --> 05:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
if I may that that reminded me of
 
05:05:08.750 --> 05:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
something else in New Hampshire and this
 
05:05:11.150 --> 05:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
is this is the third fourth term this
 
05:05:13.550 --> 05:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
issue fourth term this issue has come up
 
05:05:16.850 --> 05:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
that I've been in and nobody has refuted
 
05:05:18.890 --> 05:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
the process that we have here in New
 
05:05:21.410 --> 05:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you have somebody under the
 
05:05:24.230 --> 05:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
age of 18 they need parental agreement
 
05:05:27.350 --> 05:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
that the marriage license be issued and
 
05:05:29.628 --> 05:05:29.638 align:start position:0%
then there's a magistrate review as well
 
05:05:32.330 --> 05:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
to ensure that there's not internal
 
05:05:35.090 --> 05:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
family coercion and the like and so the
 
05:05:37.850 --> 05:05:37.860 align:start position:0%
the concerns about you know child brides
 
05:05:39.890 --> 05:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
and people getting coerced we've put
 
05:05:42.830 --> 05:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
we've built in safety uh
 
05:05:45.230 --> 05:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
apps here in New Hampshire to try to
 
05:05:47.628 --> 05:05:47.638 align:start position:0%
eliminate that I think we had a bill a
 
05:05:49.930 --> 05:05:49.940 align:start position:0%
year or two ago that specifically made
 
05:05:53.868 --> 05:05:53.878 align:start position:0%
coercion and marriage or abortion
 
05:05:56.150 --> 05:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
illegal so
 
05:05:58.670 --> 05:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
so I gave you a much longer answer than
 
05:06:01.070 --> 05:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
you asked sorry follow-up representative
 
05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
Greg yes I'm a learner I always
 
05:06:04.310 --> 05:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate the information
 
05:06:06.470 --> 05:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
um you also said that you are for the
 
05:06:09.050 --> 05:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
sanctity of marriage yes which I am as
 
05:06:09.060 --> 05:06:10.368 align:start position:0%
sanctity of marriage yes which I am as
well

05:06:10.368 --> 05:06:10.378 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:06:12.890 --> 05:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
um do you know that the current would
 
05:06:14.810 --> 05:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
you believe that the current statistics
 
05:06:17.810 --> 05:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
for divorce are over 50 percent
 
05:06:20.810 --> 05:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
I was married 41 years and I'm surprised
 
05:06:21.910 --> 05:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's 50
 
05:06:24.470 --> 05:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
and when you tell you the truth but that
 
05:06:26.990 --> 05:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
does not because this is an individual
 
05:06:29.930 --> 05:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
issue sure individuals make that
 
05:06:32.628 --> 05:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
decision the state doesn't step in and
 
05:06:35.448 --> 05:06:35.458 align:start position:0%
say 50 is unacceptable too many of you
 
05:06:37.010 --> 05:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
are getting divorced we're going to set
 
05:06:38.570 --> 05:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
up a marriage review board before
 
05:06:40.970 --> 05:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
anything finished no I'm giving you my
 
05:06:44.230 --> 05:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
answer still I'm I I understand the 50
 
05:06:47.150 --> 05:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
but that does not create an opportunity
 
05:06:49.550 --> 05:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
for the state to step in and add
 
05:06:51.590 --> 05:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
additional regulation to an individual
 
05:06:54.530 --> 05:06:54.540 align:start position:0%
Choice I'm very pro-choice as well and
 
05:06:54.540 --> 05:06:55.750 align:start position:0%
Choice I'm very pro-choice as well and
sticking

05:06:55.750 --> 05:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
sticking
 
05:06:58.010 --> 05:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
representative Greg you can follow up
 
05:06:59.930 --> 05:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you and sticking with our mutual
 
05:07:01.730 --> 05:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
agreement that the sanctity of marriage
 
05:07:03.890 --> 05:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
is is a good thing
 
05:07:06.770 --> 05:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
um would you believe that if you if for
 
05:07:08.930 --> 05:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
children getting married under 18 that
 
05:07:11.810 --> 05:07:11.820 align:start position:0%
statistic jumped up to 70 percent end up
 
05:07:13.788 --> 05:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
in divorce
 
05:07:15.830 --> 05:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
of the five kids that have been married
 
05:07:17.750 --> 05:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire since we changed the
 
05:07:20.570 --> 05:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
law to prohibit under the age of 16 how
 
05:07:22.970 --> 05:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
many of them have been divorced I mean
 
05:07:25.128 --> 05:07:25.138 align:start position:0%
or you know let's talk about New
 
05:07:25.138 --> 05:07:26.448 align:start position:0%
or you know let's talk about New
Hampshire

05:07:26.448 --> 05:07:26.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:07:28.550 --> 05:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
um are are do we know that there's any
 
05:07:30.470 --> 05:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
problem with any of those five do we
 
05:07:32.690 --> 05:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
want to go bust into any houses and pull
 
05:07:34.430 --> 05:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
people apart and say you guys shouldn't
 
05:07:36.110 --> 05:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
have gotten married we don't approve of
 
05:07:38.150 --> 05:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
this conduct no
 
05:07:43.310 --> 05:07:43.320 align:start position:0%
so I I I I do not think you can
 
05:07:46.310 --> 05:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
strictly look at the choices of
 
05:07:48.110 --> 05:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
individual freedom
 
05:07:50.990 --> 05:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
on the basis of broad demographic
 
05:07:51.000 --> 05:07:53.750 align:start position:0%
on the basis of broad demographic
statistics

05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
05:07:55.490 --> 05:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
but we're okay with not being able to
 
05:07:59.570 --> 05:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
hang on hang on hang on hang on what
 
05:08:01.910 --> 05:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's no no no no no no it's it's
 
05:08:04.250 --> 05:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
that's the signal for May I follow up
 
05:08:06.470 --> 05:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
this is the signal for you got a whole
 
05:08:08.270 --> 05:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
lot of newbie energy I know apologize
 
05:08:10.730 --> 05:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
you're good and with all due respect
 
05:08:10.740 --> 05:08:12.170 align:start position:0%
you're good and with all due respect
indeed

05:08:12.170 --> 05:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
indeed
 
05:08:14.510 --> 05:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
um but we're okay with uh making sure
 
05:08:16.250 --> 05:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
that we limit military involvement until
 
05:08:16.260 --> 05:08:19.128 align:start position:0%
that we limit military involvement until
18.

05:08:19.128 --> 05:08:19.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:21.770 --> 05:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
all right well they can get married or
 
05:08:23.208 --> 05:08:23.218 align:start position:0%
excuse me they can go into the military
 
05:08:25.490 --> 05:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
sooner than that and the military is
 
05:08:27.530 --> 05:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
kind of a unique situation where we're
 
05:08:29.690 --> 05:08:29.700 align:start position:0%
specifically trying to take people and
 
05:08:31.250 --> 05:08:31.260 align:start position:0%
make them physically and mentally
 
05:08:33.948 --> 05:08:33.958 align:start position:0%
capable going out and on order killing
 
05:08:37.010 --> 05:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
others and breaking things so it's it it
 
05:08:39.890 --> 05:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
it there's a kind of a high standard of
 
05:08:42.770 --> 05:08:42.780 align:start position:0%
anti-social behavior that we ask the
 
05:08:45.590 --> 05:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
military to get kids ready to perform
 
05:08:49.128 --> 05:08:49.138 align:start position:0%
for us so it it be going into the
 
05:08:51.708 --> 05:08:51.718 align:start position:0%
military is a different life choice than
 
05:08:55.368 --> 05:08:55.378 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers or early marriage
 
05:08:57.708 --> 05:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
okay we are now going to hear from
 
05:08:59.510 --> 05:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative petrigno
 
05:09:01.310 --> 05:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:09:03.410 --> 05:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
05:09:06.350 --> 05:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
what options uh does someone have under
 
05:09:08.270 --> 05:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 if they're in a Loveless
 
05:09:11.690 --> 05:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
or abusive relationship that they can't
 
05:09:14.810 --> 05:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
get out of since divorce is not allowed
 
05:09:17.990 --> 05:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
for individuals under the age of 18. how
 
05:09:19.550 --> 05:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
do they how do they manage living in
 
05:09:21.530 --> 05:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
that kind of a circumstance I'm not an
 
05:09:23.390 --> 05:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
attorney I'm certainly not a family law
 
05:09:25.730 --> 05:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
attorney I I I've heard it put into
 
05:09:28.550 --> 05:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh that people under the
 
05:09:30.770 --> 05:09:30.780 align:start position:0%
age of 18 can't go get a divorce
 
05:09:33.590 --> 05:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
attorney and file for divorce this is
 
05:09:36.110 --> 05:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
the fourth term this bill has come up
 
05:09:37.970 --> 05:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
you would think that the sponsor of this
 
05:09:40.490 --> 05:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
bill would have fixed that you know I I
 
05:09:42.650 --> 05:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
would I would be a strong advocate of an
 
05:09:45.650 --> 05:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
amendment that said you know filing for
 
05:09:48.890 --> 05:09:48.900 align:start position:0%
divorce is a legal option at any age uh
 
05:09:50.510 --> 05:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
and that and that's the standard way in
 
05:09:52.670 --> 05:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
which we let people get out of the kind
 
05:09:54.708 --> 05:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
of negative uh marriage that you just
 
05:09:54.718 --> 05:09:59.030 align:start position:0%

childhood experiences when they occur
 
05:11:30.410 --> 05:11:30.420 align:start position:0%

abbreviated to Aces aces are widely

studied traumatic events that children
 
05:11:37.970 --> 05:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
can experience during childhood and that
 
05:11:39.288 --> 05:11:39.298 align:start position:0%
have lasting and devastating
 
05:11:41.990 --> 05:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
consequences throughout life Aces have
 
05:11:44.030 --> 05:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
been linked to negative consequences
 
05:11:46.750 --> 05:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
such as poor education and job potential
 
05:11:49.250 --> 05:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
they've been also linked to dangerous
 
05:11:51.470 --> 05:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
Health consequences such as higher rates
 
05:11:55.788 --> 05:11:55.798 align:start position:0%
of cancer diabetes heart disease back

pain and higher risk of suicide
 
05:12:02.090 --> 05:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
um but there is hope
 
05:12:05.628 --> 05:12:05.638 align:start position:0%
um Aces can be prevented the CDC cites

against violence and adversity as one of

the top ways for preventing Aces this
 
05:12:13.310 --> 05:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
bill is a simple way to advocate for
 
05:12:14.690 --> 05:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
that strategy
 
05:12:16.550 --> 05:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation will continue
 
05:12:19.010 --> 05:12:19.020 align:start position:0%

I'm here in support of HB 34.
 
05:13:14.810 --> 05:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
um I just want to I agree and share my
 
05:13:16.310 --> 05:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
perspective briefly on some of the
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
points made prior
 
05:13:21.170 --> 05:13:21.180 align:start position:0%
um you know it goes without saying that
 
05:13:22.430 --> 05:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
you know we've talked about marriage
 
05:13:24.170 --> 05:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
being a legal contract and that children
 
05:13:27.708 --> 05:13:27.718 align:start position:0%
cannot legally enter into such contracts
 
05:13:30.110 --> 05:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
um representative Levick mentioned in
 
05:13:32.810 --> 05:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
her testimony that
 
05:13:34.670 --> 05:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
um you know this the question is you
 
05:13:37.250 --> 05:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
know our 16 and 17 year olds
 
05:13:38.990 --> 05:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
um do they know what love is and do they
 
05:13:41.208 --> 05:13:41.218 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
05:13:44.390 --> 05:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
and um you know I'd suggest that indeed
 
05:13:46.910 --> 05:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
it is I met my husband when I was 15
 
05:13:50.390 --> 05:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
years old dated for five years got
 
05:13:52.430 --> 05:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
married when I was 20 and we've been
 
05:13:54.590 --> 05:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
married for 44 years never dated another
 
05:13:56.990 --> 05:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
person and I'm happily married
 
05:13:59.810 --> 05:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
um and I realized how fortunate I was
 
05:14:01.610 --> 05:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
um I was a junior in a nursing school at
 
05:14:03.890 --> 05:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
bu at the time and my husband was three
 
05:14:05.868 --> 05:14:05.878 align:start position:0%
years older than I was
 
05:14:08.868 --> 05:14:08.878 align:start position:0%
um and I would suggest that much of the
 
05:14:11.930 --> 05:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
reason that my life has been
 
05:14:14.570 --> 05:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
um is easy in many ways as it was was
 
05:14:16.550 --> 05:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
because number one
 
05:14:17.990 --> 05:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I was allowed to continue my
 
05:14:19.190 --> 05:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
education because I had really
 
05:14:21.288 --> 05:14:21.298 align:start position:0%
supportive parents
 
05:14:23.330 --> 05:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
um they had a home where we were able to
 
05:14:26.270 --> 05:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
live in an apartment within that home
 
05:14:28.190 --> 05:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
um and many kids now given housing
 
05:14:32.090 --> 05:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
prices and tuition for schools
 
05:14:34.970 --> 05:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
um you know an unplanned pregnancy or a
 
05:14:37.368 --> 05:14:37.378 align:start position:0%
decision that they may enter into
 
05:14:39.650 --> 05:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
because they love somebody
 
05:14:41.030 --> 05:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
um but really don't get the big picture
 
05:14:43.430 --> 05:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
of what comes down the line uh for me
 
05:14:45.170 --> 05:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
it's been six children a lot of foster
 
05:14:48.910 --> 05:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
children and I truly believe that
 
05:14:51.590 --> 05:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
the foundation that I was afforded and
 
05:14:53.390 --> 05:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
the time that I was afforded to grow up
 
05:14:55.910 --> 05:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
and mature even with my husband at 20
 
05:14:59.090 --> 05:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
we're now 64 and 66
 
05:15:01.550 --> 05:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
um and you know we're we're
 
05:15:03.890 --> 05:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
um just like anybody you know you you um
 
05:15:05.750 --> 05:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
you're the same person you probably were
 
05:15:07.610 --> 05:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
in many ways but you also grow and
 
05:15:09.410 --> 05:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
develop and that was one of the other
 
05:15:10.788 --> 05:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
things that was raised the difference
 
05:15:14.750 --> 05:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
between you know well why 16 not 18.
 
05:15:17.990 --> 05:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
um you know as a as a nurse too you know
 
05:15:20.090 --> 05:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
I I think of the you know development of
 
05:15:22.970 --> 05:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
the prefronto prefrontal cortex
 
05:15:25.128 --> 05:15:25.138 align:start position:0%
um and that area of our brain is
 
05:15:27.110 --> 05:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
responsible for things like planning
 
05:15:30.970 --> 05:15:30.980 align:start position:0%
prioritizing controlling impulses
 
05:15:33.788 --> 05:15:33.798 align:start position:0%
18 year olds are finishing up puberty
 
05:15:36.350 --> 05:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
you have it you know these kids have a
 
05:15:38.270 --> 05:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
greater uh sense of themselves
 
05:15:40.850 --> 05:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
developmentally and a greater capacity
 
05:15:43.368 --> 05:15:43.378 align:start position:0%
for developmenting developing healthy
 
05:15:46.190 --> 05:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
romantic relationships I think what we
 
05:15:47.868 --> 05:15:47.878 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity and the knowledge
 
05:15:51.770 --> 05:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
and how to improve our kids lives and we
 
05:15:53.270 --> 05:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
acknowledge their abilities and their
 
05:15:54.890 --> 05:15:54.900 align:start position:0%
development I don't think we would ever
 
05:15:56.690 --> 05:15:56.700 align:start position:0%
want to go backward
 
05:16:00.590 --> 05:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
um you know and and we should look at
 
05:16:04.128 --> 05:16:04.138 align:start position:0%
um uh you know making protecting our
 
05:16:06.230 --> 05:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
kids protecting their future children
 
05:16:11.270 --> 05:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
and Society in general by by passing
 
05:16:20.150 --> 05:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:24.948 --> 05:16:24.958 align:start position:0%

support
 
05:17:11.690 --> 05:17:11.700 align:start position:0%
setting this bright line legislation
 
05:17:14.990 --> 05:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
which means no exceptions I I guess I
 
05:17:17.150 --> 05:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
would caution us about getting too much
 
05:17:19.850 --> 05:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
into maturity right it is because this
 
05:17:23.090 --> 05:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
isn't about maturity we may know 16 year
 
05:17:26.390 --> 05:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
olds who are very mature we may know 50
 
05:17:29.208 --> 05:17:29.218 align:start position:0%
year olds who are not it's not about
 
05:17:31.788 --> 05:17:31.798 align:start position:0%
maturity it's about legal rights and
 
05:17:31.798 --> 05:17:34.190 align:start position:0%
maturity it's about legal rights and
responsibilities

05:17:34.190 --> 05:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
05:17:37.730 --> 05:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
um that individuals obtain when they
 
05:17:40.970 --> 05:17:40.980 align:start position:0%
turn 18 regardless of their maturity
 
05:17:40.980 --> 05:17:41.930 align:start position:0%
turn 18 regardless of their maturity
level

05:17:41.930 --> 05:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:17:44.090 --> 05:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
a child cannot enter into legal
 
05:17:47.390 --> 05:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
contracts like they can't secure housing
 
05:17:50.628 --> 05:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
they can't secure legal assistance they

can't go to a domestic violence shelter
 
05:17:54.780 --> 05:17:55.550 align:start position:0%
can't go to a domestic violence shelter
um

05:17:55.550 --> 05:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:59.150 --> 05:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
the 16 or 17 year old is still in most
 
05:18:02.030 --> 05:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
ways legally a child and when married
 
05:18:04.850 --> 05:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
they are now legally trapped by their
 
05:18:08.628 --> 05:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
adult spouse as previously mentioned if
 
05:18:11.270 --> 05:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
the father of a baby wants to co-parent
 
05:18:14.090 --> 05:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
he can easily do so outside of marriage
 
05:18:16.910 --> 05:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
by establishing paternity the baby could
 
05:18:19.610 --> 05:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
be covered by his insurance
 
05:18:22.910 --> 05:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
a service member can designate anyone as
 
05:18:25.490 --> 05:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
the beneficiary of their service members
 
05:18:28.368 --> 05:18:28.378 align:start position:0%
group life insurance regardless of
 
05:18:30.470 --> 05:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
marital status
 
05:18:32.810 --> 05:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
the numbers the very low numbers we have
 
05:18:35.270 --> 05:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
very low numbers of children 16 and 17
 
05:18:36.850 --> 05:18:36.860 align:start position:0%
year olds who are getting married
 
05:18:40.550 --> 05:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
however New York and Massachusetts both
 
05:18:43.610 --> 05:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
recently passed brightline legislation
 
05:18:47.810 --> 05:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
meaning that they they've set the bar at
 
05:18:50.510 --> 05:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
18. I'm also the executive director of
 
05:18:53.810 --> 05:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
nasw Vermont working very hard to get it
 
05:18:57.350 --> 05:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
passed in Vermont as well it is only a
 
05:19:00.110 --> 05:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
matter of time before those numbers go
 
05:19:00.120 --> 05:19:01.970 align:start position:0%
matter of time before those numbers go
up

05:19:01.970 --> 05:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:19:04.430 --> 05:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
um we can anticipate this number Rising
 
05:19:07.670 --> 05:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
given child marriage is a tactic used by
 
05:19:10.128 --> 05:19:10.138 align:start position:0%
child traffickers to further control
 
05:19:12.890 --> 05:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
their victims but now from a legal
 
05:19:15.590 --> 05:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
standpoint taking a 16 year old across
 
05:19:18.830 --> 05:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
state lines can be a federal crime
 
05:19:22.850 --> 05:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
taking your wife across state lines is
 
05:19:25.610 --> 05:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay
 
05:19:29.570 --> 05:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
by setting no exception legislation and
 
05:19:31.430 --> 05:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
only allowing those who are over the age
 
05:19:33.288 --> 05:19:33.298 align:start position:0%
of 18 to marry
 
05:19:37.070 --> 05:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
State shopping ends child rapists can be
 
05:19:39.650 --> 05:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
punished and not wed to their victims
 
05:19:42.470 --> 05:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
child trafficking under the guise of
 
05:19:43.910 --> 05:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
marriage will end
 
05:19:46.250 --> 05:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
and we basically can stop this form of
 
05:19:47.868 --> 05:19:47.878 align:start position:0%
human slavery
 
05:19:49.910 --> 05:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony and
 
05:19:51.350 --> 05:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
I'm very happy to answer any questions
 
05:19:53.990 --> 05:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
05:19:56.270 --> 05:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
05:19:58.970 --> 05:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
petrigno thank you Mr Chad thank you for
 
05:20:00.650 --> 05:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh if on your
 
05:20:02.510 --> 05:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
testimony to be very compelling would
 
05:20:03.948 --> 05:20:03.958 align:start position:0%
you be willing to submit something in
 
05:20:05.570 --> 05:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
writing that we could have for the
 
05:20:07.850 --> 05:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
record I have something in writing I'm
 
05:20:11.090 --> 05:20:11.100 align:start position:0%

05:20:15.650 --> 05:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
to one page I am very happy to I could I
 
05:20:17.628 --> 05:20:17.638 align:start position:0%

you would like I'll keep it to this and

thank you so much for your testimony
 
05:20:27.948 --> 05:20:27.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:20:27.958 --> 05:20:29.570 align:start position:0%
thank you
what

05:20:29.570 --> 05:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:20:33.230 --> 05:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I
 
05:20:36.708 --> 05:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
representative panic I am so sorry
 
05:20:39.830 --> 05:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
my first question too okay everyone pay
 
05:20:41.990 --> 05:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
a special attention and representative
 
05:20:44.270 --> 05:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
closer to the mic so we can hear every
 
05:20:46.610 --> 05:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
word of it what really got my attention
 
05:20:48.530 --> 05:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
is what you're talking about as a child
 
05:20:51.350 --> 05:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
trafficking element of it and when we
 
05:20:52.850 --> 05:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
know what's going on with the border
 
05:20:56.868 --> 05:20:56.878 align:start position:0%
security issue a car down in Texas and
 
05:21:02.030 --> 05:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
Arizona do are you anticipating
 
05:21:05.510 --> 05:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
an increase of child marriages
 
05:21:07.788 --> 05:21:07.798 align:start position:0%
I would not be surprised thank you for
 
05:21:10.368 --> 05:21:10.378 align:start position:0%
the question I can't predict the future
 
05:21:13.310 --> 05:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
I would not be surprised if the states
 
05:21:15.650 --> 05:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
that are around
 
05:21:17.990 --> 05:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts New York I believe
 
05:21:21.650 --> 05:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania New Jersey
 
05:21:25.368 --> 05:21:25.378 align:start position:0%
I-93 is a corridor of all sorts of
 
05:21:28.490 --> 05:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh stuff right and so if you're shopping
 
05:21:34.070 --> 05:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
for where you can legally marry your 16
 
05:21:36.530 --> 05:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
or 17 year old that you're trafficking
 
05:21:40.910 --> 05:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the next stop up on 93.
 
05:21:44.330 --> 05:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
so this is a nap follow-up no I want to
 
05:21:46.368 --> 05:21:46.378 align:start position:0%
say one more thing so this is a national
 
05:21:51.410 --> 05:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
security issue as well and we are also
 
05:21:53.270 --> 05:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
trying to protect the children from
 
05:21:56.510 --> 05:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
what's what's going on absolutely all
 
05:21:59.510 --> 05:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much thank you
 
05:22:02.510 --> 05:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
well done you're first
 
05:22:05.628 --> 05:22:05.638 align:start position:0%
not bad yeah anyone else first or
 
05:22:05.638 --> 05:22:08.030 align:start position:0%
not bad yeah anyone else first or
otherwise

05:22:08.030 --> 05:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
05:22:10.970 --> 05:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
all right I have a card I'm gonna do my
 
05:22:15.288 --> 05:22:15.298 align:start position:0%
best on this Dan or Don Albrecht
 
05:22:17.690 --> 05:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
be again
 
05:22:19.788 --> 05:22:19.798 align:start position:0%
your handwriting got a little worse from
 
05:22:21.110 --> 05:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
the last card
 
05:22:23.330 --> 05:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
that's because I banged it out you only
 
05:22:27.650 --> 05:22:27.660 align:start position:0%
rescued it by good testimony so
 
05:22:30.530 --> 05:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
uh Dana Albrecht National Albrecht
 
05:22:33.890 --> 05:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
Nashua New Hampshire just very briefly I
 
05:22:36.350 --> 05:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
point out the cultural norm widespread
 
05:22:38.628 --> 05:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
these days is for people to have sexual
 
05:22:41.030 --> 05:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
relations outside of marriage
 
05:22:43.730 --> 05:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
uh number two I don't think the state
 
05:22:47.868 --> 05:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
has any business regardless of gender or
 
05:22:51.770 --> 05:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
orientation uh interfering what any two
 
05:22:54.288 --> 05:22:54.298 align:start position:0%
people above the age of consent do
 
05:22:56.230 --> 05:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
behind closed doors
 
05:23:00.230 --> 05:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh with regard to those relations with
 
05:23:03.650 --> 05:23:03.660 align:start position:0%
that said I have to ask what is the
 
05:23:06.788 --> 05:23:06.798 align:start position:0%
state's policy uh concerning people
 
05:23:09.770 --> 05:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
below the age of consent to have
 
05:23:12.948 --> 05:23:12.958 align:start position:0%
relations with someone else changing
 
05:23:16.368 --> 05:23:16.378 align:start position:0%
their gender or orientation and why
 
05:23:20.448 --> 05:23:20.458 align:start position:0%
sort of a rhetorical question and lastly
 
05:23:24.708 --> 05:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
there remains a cultural and religious
 
05:23:28.490 --> 05:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
minority who sincerely held beliefs
 
05:23:32.090 --> 05:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
uh or that they would prefer to wait uh
 
05:23:34.190 --> 05:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
until after they are married to have
 
05:23:35.770 --> 05:23:35.780 align:start position:0%
sexual relations
 
05:23:39.890 --> 05:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
and I would just ask what the state's
 
05:23:41.208 --> 05:23:41.218 align:start position:0%
policy is
 
05:23:46.610 --> 05:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
towards uh to people who are above the
 
05:23:50.110 --> 05:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
age of consent to have sexual relations
 
05:23:53.208 --> 05:23:53.218 align:start position:0%
uh whether they're allowed to get
 
05:23:56.628 --> 05:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
married first if those constitute there
 
05:24:00.530 --> 05:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
are sincerely held religious beliefs uh
 
05:24:02.270 --> 05:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
and again just
 
05:24:04.788 --> 05:24:04.798 align:start position:0%
a question rhetorically for the
 
05:24:07.490 --> 05:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm done I'm not really
 
05:24:10.550 --> 05:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
prepared to answer questions okay but if
 
05:24:14.150 --> 05:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:16.570 --> 05:24:16.580 align:start position:0%
looks like you're off the hook thank you
 
05:24:19.368 --> 05:24:19.378 align:start position:0%
normally state representatives go ahead
 
05:24:20.990 --> 05:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
of the line unless they're on the
 
05:24:21.000 --> 05:24:22.010 align:start position:0%
of the line unless they're on the
committee

05:24:22.010 --> 05:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:24:25.010 --> 05:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
that's why we're saving for last
 
05:24:31.490 --> 05:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:34.070 --> 05:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know my my wife who spent a year of
 
05:24:37.430 --> 05:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
college in Mexico cannot her ours and I
 
05:24:40.930 --> 05:24:40.940 align:start position:0%
