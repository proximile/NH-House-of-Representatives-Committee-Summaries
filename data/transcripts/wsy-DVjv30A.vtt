okay we will open up this very
 
00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
informative presentation uh from the

insurance department that'll tell us all
 
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
the secrets that go on behind closed
 
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:43.430 align:start position:0%
the secrets that go on behind closed

I would also like to thank you for the
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
privilege to present some valuable
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
information to you
 
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
some of which may help to inform the
 
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
important policy decisions that lie in
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
front of you New Hampshire is considered
 
00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
a Pioneer state in terms of data-driven
 
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
health care information
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
we were among the first states to
 
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
implement an all-payer claims database
 
00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:19.259 align:start position:0%
in fact Alex felve and representative
 
00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 align:start position:0%
hunt were Central forces in the
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
legislation authorizing the
 
00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
establishment of this database which we
 
00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
now refer to as the New Hampshire chis
 
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
we've taken the Liberty to prepare for
 
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
you a document and a set of slides that
 
00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
will advance your understanding of the
 
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire chiz in some of his
 
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.890 align:start position:0%

outputs

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
outputs
 
00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
we've also prepared some copies for
 
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
interested members of the audience
 
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
please flip through the pages while
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
we've talked briefly about several
 
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
important concepts related to the
 
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
medical claims data
 
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
my goal is to not talk about each and
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
every slide but to give you a 10 000
 
00:07:59.689 --> 00:07:59.699 align:start position:0%
foot overview of what the New Hampshire
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
chiz is all about in New Hampshire
 
00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
Health cost
 
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
and to leave opportunity plenty of
 
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
the first couple slides talks about the
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority and confidentiality
 
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.160 align:start position:0%

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
RSA 420 G11 authorized the insurance
 
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
department to collect this data from his
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
commercial carriers
 
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:25.220 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire insurance department
 
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
DHHS and doj have a data use in Sharing

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
researchers all around the country May
 
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
request public use and limited use forms
 
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
of the data through an Apple application
 
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
process which is currently managed by

00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
so what is the chis
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's a robust data set consisting of
 
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.140 align:start position:0%

receives quarterly updates
 
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
when you're trying to understand data
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
you always want to think about who what
 
00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
and when who does the data represent
 
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
what does it represent in what periods
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
of time is it representative
 
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
this includes claims from commercial
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
payers Medicaid and opt-in erisa plans
 
00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
some important variables are listed
 
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
below the most important one I've
 
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
highlighted it's the allowed amount when
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
we hear about prices and costs and paid
 
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
amounts usually we're referring to
 
00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
allowed amounts but in addition there
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
are some other quantitative parameters
 
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
including build them out paid amount and
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
cost sharing contributions such as copay
 
00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:02.459 align:start position:0%
deductible and coinsurance
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
there's also procedure codes diagnosis
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
codes and indicator variables for
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
insurance Market category provider NPI
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
in member demographic information we're
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
working to make more robust our our
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
variable for drgs which is diagnostic
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
related groups which it can give us a
 
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
better sense of some of the more complex
 
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:26.700 align:start position:0%
variables in the chis database
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
medical claims data is inherently not
 
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
straightforward so having the drg
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
parameter well developed will give us a
 
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
better sense of the holistic cost of an
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.570 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
to put into perspective the size of the
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
database I mentioned the three claims
 
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
files medical dental and prescription
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
the medical claims contains 117
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
variables prescription claims 130
 
00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
variables and dental claims 122
 
00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.389 align:start position:0%
variables and dental claims 122
variables

00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
variables
 
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
currently data extracts are
 
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
so who who uses the New Hampshire chis
 
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
and how do they use it we'll start with
 
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire insurance department
 
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
our most important use for the chiz is
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
to derive rates for New Hampshire Health
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
costs which we'll talk about in a few
 
00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:21.710 align:start position:0%
costs which we'll talk about in a few
moments

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
moments
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
we also use this data to assess New
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire provider Network adequacy
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
in fact New Hampshire has a very
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
Innovative empirically based Network
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
adequacy review process
 
00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:35.459 align:start position:0%
we also use the chiz to support
 
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
legislative policy making for example to
 
00:11:41.569 --> 00:11:41.579 align:start position:0%
review the costs of State mandates
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
and to support the work of legislative
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
commissions so can you um explain could
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of new members what
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
network adequacy means generically in
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
specifically why it's important to the
 
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.550 align:start position:0%
specifically why it's important to the
Department

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:11:59.290 --> 00:11:59.300 align:start position:0%
um since the Advent of managed care
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
where health insurance coverage is
 
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
offered through the development of a
 
00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.430 align:start position:0%
offered through the development of a
network

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
network
 
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:09.980 align:start position:0%
um where the consumer has a financial
 
00:12:13.009 --> 00:12:13.019 align:start position:0%
incentive to get their care from within
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
that Network the issue has has become
 
00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
important of the adequacy of that
 
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
Network to serve all of the potential
 
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
needs of the insured population
 
00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:26.579 align:start position:0%
so when Managed Care came about within a
 
00:12:29.329 --> 00:12:29.339 align:start position:0%
few years all the states began to
 
00:12:32.329 --> 00:12:32.339 align:start position:0%
develop standards for adequacy of
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
network and those are usually expressed
 
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
in terms of time and distance so for
 
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
various provider types or service types
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
there are standards for how long it
 
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:50.420 align:start position:0%
would take to access that provider and
 
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:53.540 align:start position:0%
how close they are to you
 
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.220 align:start position:0%
so those standards are developed
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
authorized in legislation in New
 
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and developed through a
 
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
specific rule
 
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
is that good enough
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
we also use the chiz data to conduct
 
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
Market conduct examinations such as the
 
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
mental health parity exams that are
 
00:13:20.569 --> 00:13:20.579 align:start position:0%
underway as we speak now
 
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:23.300 align:start position:0%
and additionally every year we're
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
required to produce an annual report on
 
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
premium rates and cost drivers in health
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
care and we use the chiz data as a
 
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
primary source of information for that
 
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.430 align:start position:0%
primary source of information for that
report

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
Additionally the New Hampshire
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice uses the chiz data
 
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
to perform Market concentration analyzes
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
as part of Anti-Trust examinations
 
00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:45.180 align:start position:0%
they do this under the New Hampshire
 
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
charitable Trust
 
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
they also use it to identify pricing
 
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
anomalies that may be suggestive of
 
00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
Monopoly power
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
and lastly the New Hampshire Department
 
00:13:57.949 --> 00:13:57.959 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services
 
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
uses the chiz data to release to public
 
00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:02.339 align:start position:0%
to inform researchers regulators and
 
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
even citizens on health care costs
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
they use it to Compare costs among New
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medicaid plans and also to
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
inform legislative bodies like yours
 
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
so now I'd like to discuss one of the
 
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
outputs one of the primary outputs of
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
the chis data New Hampshire Health cost
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
you've heard much about it in testimony
 
00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
in the last several weeks so I'd like to
 
00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:26.579 align:start position:0%
kind of tell you a little bit about it
 
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
and form inform you on what it is how we
 
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:32.339 align:start position:0%
derive rates for it and the hopes that
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
will stimulate questions from you after
 
00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
this presentation
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire Health cost is a
 
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
trusted free website created by the New
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department that
 
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
connects over 250 000 people per year to
 
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
information on health care and insurance
 
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
it Compares cost but more than 250
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
common medical dental
 
00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:56.420 align:start position:0%
and prescription services including MRIs
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
CT scans mammograms x-rays ultrasounds
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
and er visits
 
00:15:05.449 --> 00:15:05.459 align:start position:0%
it also Compares quality for hospitals
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
across the state it includes patient
 
00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:09.899 align:start position:0%
satisfaction ratings
 
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
it can be used to compare benefits using
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
an interactive customizable tool for
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
small and large employers and their
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
currently there were over 269 services
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
on listed on New Hampshire Health costs
 
00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.530 align:start position:0%

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
queries
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
for cost may be stratified by insurance
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
type individual or group
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
you can Browse by procedure keyword or

00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire Health costs has been
 
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
criticized much for the price
 
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
variability that that some users have
 
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
seen I'd like to inform you about some
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
of the sources of variability that are
 
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
that are inherent in medical claims data
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
and translated into New Hampshire Health
 
00:16:03.839 --> 00:16:05.689 align:start position:0%
and translated into New Hampshire Health
cost

00:16:05.689 --> 00:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
price variation can exist as a product
 
00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:11.420 align:start position:0%
of how hospitals bundle this Services
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
about half of the services listed on
 
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
health costs are expressed as bundled
 
00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
Services oftentimes when you go to a
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
provider it's not just one service
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
that's performed it's a series of common
 
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:26.579 align:start position:0%
Services we try to get Precision in our
 
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
price estimates by bundling them in
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
these Common Market baskets or packages
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
called bundles
 
00:16:36.769 --> 00:16:36.779 align:start position:0%
case complexity or also called case mix
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
intensity is an expression of how sick
 
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
you are how sick the patient is this can
 
00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:44.339 align:start position:0%
be a major factor that drives
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
variability in price estimates
 
00:16:50.449 --> 00:16:50.459 align:start position:0%
the number of visits per procedure not
 
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
all procedures are produced in one visit
 
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
some require multiple visits and this
 
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
can can
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
inject much bias into the price
 
00:16:58.079 --> 00:16:59.210 align:start position:0%
inject much bias into the price
estimates

00:16:59.210 --> 00:16:59.220 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
00:17:01.129 --> 00:17:01.139 align:start position:0%
as well as the frequency of procedures
 
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
and the historical lack of price
 
00:17:05.809 --> 00:17:05.819 align:start position:0%
transparency in other competitive forces
 
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:08.579 align:start position:0%
can all collectively collude to result
 
00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:11.459 align:start position:0%
in price dispersion or Price variability
 
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
which is what we see sometimes in in
 
00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
health costs let me just interject that
 
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
at this point in time a lot of other
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
states also have all payer claims
 
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.230 align:start position:0%
states also have all payer claims
databases

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
databases
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
and they have similar findings with
 
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
respect to the tremendous variability
 
00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:33.380 align:start position:0%
that can exist for the same procedure
 
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
from one provider to the next so that's
 
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
so the next couple slides gives you
 
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
examples of of how services that are
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
bundled or independent are expressed on
 
00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
health costs this first example
 
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
um is an example of arthroscopic knee
 
00:17:57.529 --> 00:17:57.539 align:start position:0%
surgery and you can see why price
 
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
variability here ranging from 3700 to 12
 
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
000 I like to point out a measure on
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
health costs called typical patient
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
complexity that serves as a good example
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
to to see why such price variability
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
exists notice how the higher price price
 
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:19.140 align:start position:0%
estimates are associated with higher
 
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
patient complexities
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
the next example
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
um is an example of a lab test called
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
pth or parathyroid hormone and you can
 
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
see that price ranges vary from 33 to
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
564 dollars which is a very wide
 
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
relative difference with the Statewide
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
so so when you have the Precision of the
 
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.490 align:start position:0%
so so when you have the Precision of the
cost

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
does that mean how precise this number
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
is when the upper up or down does that
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
mean how confident you are that this is
 
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
the right number or what what is that or
 
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
is that is relative to everybody in his
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
group thank you for the question that's
 
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
that's good that that um variable that
 
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
output is a product of a measure across
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
all of the data points for that service
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
right and we use the coefficient of
 
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
variation it's somewhat similar to a
 
00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:21.299 align:start position:0%
standard deviation or a standard error
 
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
in statistics so we use the coefficient
 
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
of variation the smaller coefficient of
 
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
variation results in higher Precision of
 
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
an estimate and if something is wildly
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
variable like you saw on the knee
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
arthroscopy example that would have a
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
large coefficient of variation in a less
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
precise estimate
 
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
right well like I'm looking at this pth
 
00:19:45.529 --> 00:19:45.539 align:start position:0%
which is could be can't be any simpler
 
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
than just a test right and then I'm
 
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
saying uh littleton's 313 well that's
 
00:19:54.409 --> 00:19:54.419 align:start position:0%
low and then weeks Medical Center 332
 
00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
very low so what is that telling me
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
so measures of variation like for
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
example like the coefficient of low
 
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
versus very low and but one is higher
 
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
than the other so those are rankings of
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
the size of the coefficient of variation
 
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
so the it's hard to express that to fund
 
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:21.230 align:start position:0%
so the it's hard to express that to fund
statistics

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:26.049 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:20:26.049 --> 00:20:26.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
you wanna try one more time why explain
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
to me so what is that what does that
 
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
tell me
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
that do I
 
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:38.350 align:start position:0%
that do I
mean

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
ah okay that's what I was trying to get
 
00:20:40.559 --> 00:20:45.409 align:start position:0%
ah okay that's what I was trying to get
at

00:20:45.409 --> 00:20:45.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.419 --> 00:20:47.169 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:20:47.169 --> 00:20:47.179 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what I was hoping it
 
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
is about that establishment not
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
comparing it to anybody else okay okay
 
00:20:57.049 --> 00:20:57.059 align:start position:0%
good thank you hi hi thanks for taking
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
um I know that you have another page
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
where I mean part where you can see the
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
quality of the hospital is there
 
00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
anywhere that links the pricing to the
 
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
quality of this particular department or
 
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
this procedure because you could pay you
 
00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:13.559 align:start position:0%
know three thousand dollars or six
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar in the three thousand I
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
mean the six thousand dollar one
 
00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
potentially I mean maybe higher quality
 
00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
and they get better outcomes so if yeah
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and that's a
 
00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
good question yeah it is if you notice
 
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
the little boxes next to each provider
 
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
or facility name if you click on that
 
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
you can click on several and there's a
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
box on on the left box you can see
 
00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
compare selected a lightly shaded box
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
that says yeah selected when you do that
 
00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
those facilities pop up in all of their
 
00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
quality scores for different
 
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
pre-selected parameters come up okay
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
great sorry I'm married to a doctor so
 
00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you and those those are
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
a product of patient satisfaction
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
reports for pre-selected parameters yeah
 
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
okay look overall and keep in mind the
 
00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
information on the next slide
 
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
yes higher cost care oftentimes does not
 
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
confer with better quality care so
 
00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
research finds that there is no
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
relationship for this for example some
 
00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
services like lab tests there's little
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
difference in quality no matter where
 
00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:21.059 align:start position:0%
you go however as we saw in the last
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
slide there is still big differences in
 
00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:25.730 align:start position:0%
slide there is still big differences in
cost

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.529 --> 00:22:27.539 align:start position:0%
so now I'd like to talk about some of
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
our future goals for the New Hampshire
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
chis currently hospitals and carriers
 
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
are now under federal law required to
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
post the in-network and out of network
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
in uninsured rates on their websites New
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
Hampshire chis can be used to reconcile
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
that the actual claims data match the
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
price that providers or carriers list
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
for any given procedure
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
this serves as a great consumer
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
protection mechanism
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
and is indeed a price transparency
 
00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
mechanism that is known to promote
 
00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
competition exert downward pressure on
 
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.029 align:start position:0%
competition exert downward pressure on
prices

00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
prices
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
and reveal disparities in discriminatory
 
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
pricing practices all of which are good
 
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
I'd like to drill down to two specific
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
Innovations in price transparency the
 
00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
hospital price transparency law requires
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals to post in-network out of
 
00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:24.539 align:start position:0%
network in uninsured rates in a machine
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
readable file and a consumer friendly
 
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.730 align:start position:0%
readable file and a consumer friendly
format

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
format
 
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
whereas the transparency and coverage
 
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:34.340 align:start position:0%
legislation which applies to carriers
 
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
requires them to post negotiated rates
 
00:23:39.289 --> 00:23:39.299 align:start position:0%
and cost-sharing information in a
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
consumer-friendly format
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
as well as post in-network provided
 
00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
negotiated rates historical
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
out-of-network allowed amounts and Drug
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
pricing information through three
 
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:52.740 align:start position:0%
machine readable files posted on their
 
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
internet website
 
00:23:57.649 --> 00:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
ultimately the goal is to get
 
00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:00.059 align:start position:0%
these entities to post up to 500
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
shoppable services and a list can be
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
lastly I'd like to point out evidence of
 
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
the effect or impact on prices
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
as a result from New Hampshire Health
 
00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.789 align:start position:0%
as a result from New Hampshire Health
cost

00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
a paper that's available to you here and
 
00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
we provided provided it to some of you
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
demonstrates that in the long run an 11
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
reduction in patients out-of-pocket
 
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
amount was observed as a result of
 
00:24:30.529 --> 00:24:30.539 align:start position:0%
Services posted on New Hampshire Health
 
00:24:30.539 --> 00:24:33.350 align:start position:0%
Services posted on New Hampshire Health
costs

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:36.539 align:start position:0%
this was seen on the supply side of the
 
00:24:36.539 --> 00:24:37.970 align:start position:0%
this was seen on the supply side of the
market

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
long run reductions in prices on the
 
00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:42.419 align:start position:0%
supply side can sometimes be referred to
 
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
as the Sentinel effect an example of
 
00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
this is providers
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
observing each other and consequently
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
changing their pricing behaviors
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
additionally New Hampshire Health costs
 
00:24:57.049 --> 00:24:57.059 align:start position:0%
and Price shopping in general can also
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
influence the demand side of the market
 
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:02.220 align:start position:0%
and as an example Shoppers Price
 
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
shopping and seeking out lower cost
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
Services is an example of demand side
 
00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:12.890 align:start position:0%
Services is an example of demand side
effects

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.289 --> 00:25:15.299 align:start position:0%
so I'm just curious
 
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
um I mean we all we all know that prices
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
have been going up so are they actually
 
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
going down or have the prices that when
 
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:23.700 align:start position:0%
you're siding here of these prices just
 
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
been moving up at a slower rate than I
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
don't know the General Medical inflation
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
rate like how do you measure that are
 
00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:31.340 align:start position:0%
they actually falling in real terms
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
relative prices so the the price that a
 
00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:36.419 align:start position:0%
patient would seek for any given service
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
is going down if
 
00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:42.419 align:start position:0%
if that service was posted on health
 
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
costs so the way that it was modeled in
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
this paper I think you'd find this
 
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
interesting the way it was modeled in
 
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
this paper is if if a procedure got
 
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
posted to health cost within the next
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
four years the average reduction in
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
patient cost burden was down by 11
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
compared to
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
its counterpart if it did not get posted
 
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
on health costs it was an empirical
 
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
model that shows the effect of making
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
these prices transparent to the patient
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
to the consumer that if we make them
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
transparent it would exert a downward
 
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
pressure that in the long run would have
 
00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.230 align:start position:0%
pressure that in the long run would have
substantial

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:20.940 align:start position:0%
implications on price reduction you said
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
that there's a paper right there right
 
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
there's a paper all right cool I'll grab
 
00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
that and read it thanks okay let's go
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
ahead but and if you have a few days
 
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
where you don't have anything to do
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to enjoy that region ah
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
thanks but let me just test them out
 
00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:37.669 align:start position:0%
thanks but let me just test them out
sure

00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
uh let me just mention that
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
um you know in this paper they
 
00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
identified two driving factors this is
 
00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
what we're saying
 
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
um that in two ways in which health
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
costs has reduced prices one is by
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
influencing the supply side the provider
 
00:26:58.730 --> 00:26:58.740 align:start position:0%
of services and that's where we make
 
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
reference to the Sentinel effect which
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
which which means sort of you don't need
 
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
that much actual shopping for the
 
00:27:09.769 --> 00:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
providers to react on on their own and
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
anticipate uh and compare themselves to
 
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
other providers and respond with the
 
00:27:18.409 --> 00:27:18.419 align:start position:0%
change in pricing so that's sort of the
 
00:27:18.419 --> 00:27:19.130 align:start position:0%
change in pricing so that's sort of the
way

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:27:21.409 --> 00:27:21.419 align:start position:0%
transparency can have an effect on the
 
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
supply side and then on the demand side
 
00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
it's simpler it's like consumer shopping
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
for the lowest cost MRI and actually
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
collabra has a question
 
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.409 align:start position:0%
I understand
um

00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:39.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
we're looking at Health costs but having
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
been in dway for for Harbor care what
 
00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:48.140 align:start position:0%
are the parameters other than patient
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
feedback are you getting to measure that
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
that that is um I'd like you to explore
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
that so you can see that the number of
 
00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
um parameters that are listed under the
 
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
the quality of care but they they all
 
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
are patient uh satisfaction
 
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
qualitative surveys that are used to
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
inform that
 
00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
we're we're constantly looking for ways
 
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
to improve the quality measures that we
 
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:22.140 align:start position:0%
use and
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
um you know the Precision of our price
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
measures and we we seek to do that in
 
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
many different ways
 
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.750 align:start position:0%
many different ways
yeah

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
yeah all right well my last time I
 
00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
checked this and it's been a while but
 
00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
there was outcomes reporting outcomes
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
but it did seem you know I know I was
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
looking at my hospital for a particular
 
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
procedure and didn't have such a great
 
00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
outcome and my concern was that because
 
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
it's a smaller hospital it doesn't have
 
00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
as many procedures so your apt to uh you
 
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
know the one bad out one bad event can
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
skew the numbers
 
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
that's still true that's still being
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
reported those that's always true in all
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
statistics the a low frequency of any
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
parameter so a low frequency of
 
00:29:08.039 --> 00:29:09.230 align:start position:0%
parameter so a low frequency of
procedures

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
can bias results so Mike can I still see
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
that outcomes on on your web page so I
 
00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
do you still have that yeah the outcomes
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
are qualitative in nature self-reported
 
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
qualitative right
 
00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.010 align:start position:0%
qualitative right
okay

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
good morning the database appears to be
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
pretty impressively extensive
 
00:29:39.649 --> 00:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
but as you know we've been hearing bills
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
regarding drug prices as well as health
 
00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.750 align:start position:0%
regarding drug prices as well as health
care

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned that you and in here
 
00:29:48.889 --> 00:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
you talk about the fact that you have
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
what I'm wondering is is the details as
 
00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
to what went into that drug price there
 
00:29:59.930 --> 00:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
like the wholesale cost the PBM prices
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
the kind of money they take in versus
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
the money they take out all that sort of
 
00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
stuff is that available
 
00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:09.299 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question another great
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
question so New Hampshire chess which is
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
the data used to power Health costs uses
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
empirical medical claims data so none of
 
00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:21.419 align:start position:0%
that market data is available in the
 
00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:24.299 align:start position:0%
chis nor expressed in New Hampshire
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
Health cost
 
00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:30.059 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to phrase this as kindly as
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
I can
 
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.430 align:start position:0%
I can
um

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:36.409 --> 00:30:36.419 align:start position:0%
could you tell us
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
um why um when I tried to test the
 
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:42.860 align:start position:0%
public facing
 
00:30:45.769 --> 00:30:45.779 align:start position:0%
database where members of the public
 
00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:48.539 align:start position:0%
could check costs of certain procedures
 
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
at hospitals
 
00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
the results seem to bear
 
00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
almost no relationship to reality and
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you very briefly what I based
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
that question on it was uh based on on a
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
procedure that I had myself in August of
 
00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
2021 in Concord Hospital
 
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
um and the bill which I got because
 
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:13.799 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Blue Cross couldn't agree
 
00:31:15.409 --> 00:31:15.419 align:start position:0%
as to who was responsible and eventually
 
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
they sent the bill to me
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
um the bill I got was for thirty seven
 
00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
um the procedure was referred to by my
 
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
doctor as repair of a hiatal hernia so I
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
tried to find that procedure in the
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
insurance Department's system couldn't
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
find that found the closest thing that I
 
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
could and the prices ranged from
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
something under ten thousand dollars to
 
00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
something around twenty one thousand
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
dollars as I said
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
um the actual bill that I got was for
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
thirty seven thousand dollars so again
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
my question is why did the results
 
00:31:57.289 --> 00:31:57.299 align:start position:0%
um bear so little relationship to
 
00:31:57.299 --> 00:31:58.789 align:start position:0%
um bear so little relationship to
reality

00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
reality
 
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you and that was a very kind way
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
to ask that question so
 
00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.289 align:start position:0%
to ask that question so
um

00:32:05.289 --> 00:32:05.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:08.220 align:start position:0%
identifying prices for an encounter at a
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider or even just a a
 
00:32:12.529 --> 00:32:12.539 align:start position:0%
doctor's visit is inherently difficult
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of other ancillary
 
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
services that are involved with it and
 
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
various case mix intensity or patient
 
00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
complexity to those services and
 
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:25.140 align:start position:0%
providers are well aware of this they've
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
communicated that to us and it's one of
 
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
the biggest challenges with gleaning
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
precision and accuracy in these types of
 
00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:34.740 align:start position:0%
websites our colleagues in Maine have a
 
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
very similar website and suffer some of
 
00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:39.140 align:start position:0%
the same anguish
 
00:32:42.889 --> 00:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
a not so kind questions
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
um with their legislature too and so we
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
look to narrow that down but it's a good
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
question I think it's important to
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
understand what health cost is and what
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
is not it's not
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
um similar to a price tag in a retail
 
00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
setting where you can just look at a
 
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
price tag and understand what the what
 
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
the absolute price for that product or
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
service is rather it's a way to get a
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
sense for how much a certain medical
 
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
intervention or medical procedure might
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
cost you there are a lot of factors that
 
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
affect the variation in the the delivery
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
of those estimates and that was primary
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
purpose for us coming here is to help
 
00:33:24.049 --> 00:33:24.059 align:start position:0%
you to better understand what what it is
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
what it does what the source of the data
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
that informs those price estimates are
 
00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:31.559 align:start position:0%
and so you can be more informed to make
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
some of these important Health policy
 
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
decisions that lie in front of you
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
and um you know also one of the
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
challenges is determining
 
00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:42.779 align:start position:0%
um the shoppable services that we're
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
going to list so here your procedure
 
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:50.220 align:start position:0%
wasn't listed on our site we have some
 
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:52.140 align:start position:0%
250 now
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
and the federal law on transparency it
 
00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:00.740 align:start position:0%
aims at 500 shoppable Services
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
even if you're up at 500 it's going to
 
00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:06.659 align:start position:0%
sometimes be difficult to find that
 
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
service on the website that matches well
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
with you know what your own experience
 
00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.230 align:start position:0%
with you know what your own experience
is

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:20.089 align:start position:0%
is
foreign

00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
what is the approximate number of sight
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
hits that you get per year to the uh to
 
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
your website
 
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
so um I listened to here 250 000 I think
 
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
it was last year that that we recorded
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
yeah um so in terms of legislation that
 
00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:41.339 align:start position:0%
we have in front of us we have the one
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
that uh related to that Federal postings
 
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:50.220 align:start position:0%
and you have here a.gov listing here
 
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
and then they were saying that some
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals weren't compliance so they
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
were not using this particular list this
 
00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
with the government the federal
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
government list is
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
their CMS list their list of 500 shops
 
00:35:10.849 --> 00:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
yeah so I assume all our hospitals are
 
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
on this list or I mean that legislation
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
which said if they didn't post then they
 
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
did they get it for free I just wondered
 
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
whether it have you do you guys look at
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
this list and make sure all our
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
hospitals are on there and we uh what
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
we're doing we have assumed
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility for enforcement of the
 
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
um part of the federal legislation that
 
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
governs Health carriers so there's that
 
00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:41.180 align:start position:0%
rule called transparency and coverage
 
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
and we've responded to the federal
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
government that we are assuming
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
responsibility for enforcing the posting
 
00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:53.780 align:start position:0%
of of
 
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
those prices we do not have
 
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility for hospitals uh pricing
 
00:36:04.609 --> 00:36:04.619 align:start position:0%
although we have plans for using that
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
information to supplement Health costs
 
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.890 align:start position:0%
information to supplement Health costs
okay

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:11.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:14.220 align:start position:0%
supplement okay
 
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
you need a mic but there's a different
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh entity not the insurance
 
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.490 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh entity not the insurance
department

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
so there is a federal enforcement yeah
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay we'll we'll get to that that
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
issue yes representative Ammon
 
00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
does New Hampshire Health costs provide
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
machine readable uh files if if you're
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
assuming responsibility for the carriers
 
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
that's one of the requirements I read
 
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:46.730 align:start position:0%
that's one of the requirements I read
here

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
no that's that's for carriers to post on
 
00:36:53.089 --> 00:36:53.099 align:start position:0%
their website and so that's not on New
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Health cost
 
00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
and just follow questions but for the
 
00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.069 align:start position:0%
and just follow questions but for the
question

00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
are there as the data comes in are there
 
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
any like quality uh checks to see if
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
something is out of uh you know out of
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
the norm and that it could yeah so we've
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
been working with we've been working
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
with CMS and they have a validator tool
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
that is used to validate the Fidelity of
 
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
the submissions and so we're planning to
 
00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
be using that to
 
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
confirm that they're in material
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
compliance with their submission of that
 
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
those data that's where the the new uh
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
Federal requirements for professional
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
transparency but we also contract with
 
00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
an entity under for our own all player
 
00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:43.140 align:start position:0%
claims database to do a validity check
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
on the claims data that we get from the
 
00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
okay so then
 
00:37:56.089 --> 00:37:56.099 align:start position:0%
to the sidebar to this is now oh
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
represent I'm sorry I didn't see your
 
00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
hand up representative Walsh thank you
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
how often do you update your data is it
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
daily weekly like to add procedures or
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
to add prescription drugs I want to make
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
it clear that shiz data gets updated we
 
00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:14.339 align:start position:0%
get quarterly uploads from our vendor
 
00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
for the chiz data and then we just did
 
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
on Monday the quarterly Refresh on New
 
00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Health cost generally every
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
quarter we add somewhere between 15 to
 
00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
18 new codes new procedures on onto
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
Health costs so that number the number
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
of services listed there keeps growing
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
and so you won't find all procedures
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
in the CPT code book which there's tens
 
00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
of thousands you won't find those On Any
 
00:38:44.329 --> 00:38:44.339 align:start position:0%
Price shopping website for the question
 
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
thank you so your
 
00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
relegated to CMS so you can't do
 
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
anything other than in a three-month
 
00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:55.250 align:start position:0%
anything other than in a three-month
period

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
you said it comes in quarterly that's
 
00:38:59.870 --> 00:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
just our process
 
00:39:02.569 --> 00:39:02.579 align:start position:0%
because medical claims sometimes there's
 
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
a there's a latency to the development
 
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
of one medical claim it can sometimes
 
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
take weeks even months for one service
 
00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
to fully go through a claims process so
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
the probably the shortest tenure for
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
that would be a quarter if you made it
 
00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
monthly you would have fragmented claims
 
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
coming in so how we process our medical
 
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
claims and get them into one database is
 
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
that's done right maybe I'm not saying
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
this correctly I'm not talking about the
 
00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
claims I'm talking about adding
 
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
procedures you know the list of your
 
00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
procedures in the list I mean I realize
 
00:39:38.089 --> 00:39:38.099 align:start position:0%
they're integrated with claims but just
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
to add like a new procedure yeah so
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
given that we use the medical claims
 
00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
database to inform that that process too
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
it's relegated to taking on the same
 
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
timing because there there's an
 
00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
exhaustive process that we use to go
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
through and identify these 15 to 18
 
00:39:59.810 --> 00:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
procedures they have to be price stable
 
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
there has to be a sufficient frequency
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
of them they they have to be as um
 
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
there's a contextual part they have to
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
be a public health interest right so
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
they have there has to be certain set of
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
criteria that are quite objective
 
00:40:17.089 --> 00:40:17.099 align:start position:0%
actually that we use to ascertain with
 
00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
our existing data as it stands what
 
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
makes the grade what gets there I do
 
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
understand representative Gibbs
 
00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
frustrations about not being able to
 
00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
find your procedure or or sufficiently
 
00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
precise cost estimates for it but in
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
this absence would be guessing we'd have
 
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
nothing to refer to to identify what
 
00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
might be some of the approximate costs
 
00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
for this procedure that I'm about to
 
00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
decide on or or endure so three three
 
00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
months is generally
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
a short period of time for for that to
 
00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
evolve into something that's utilizable
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
and something that we do our due
 
00:40:58.609 --> 00:40:58.619 align:start position:0%
diligence to make sure that we have as
 
00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
price as precise as possible estimates
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
and and it's not always
 
00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
um sufficient but
 
00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.230 align:start position:0%
um sufficient but
it's necessary

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
it's necessary
 
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
representative purselli
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing
 
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs a lot so do you have
 
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
I'll try to put all my questions in one
 
00:41:23.329 --> 00:41:23.339 align:start position:0%
do you have a site or a navigation to
 
00:41:26.569 --> 00:41:26.579 align:start position:0%
your site so we could look at pers
 
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
changes in prescription drugs or costs
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
and is it possible to collect the data
 
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
that we're looking for related to
 
00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:37.859 align:start position:0%
wholesale retail and are you
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
collaborating with any other entities
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
like UNH that seems to also be
 
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
collecting this data so in in the chis
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
data there are many variables for price
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
prices of prescription drugs that's
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
included in the prescription drug file
 
00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
but there's also a robust set of data in
 
00:41:59.210 --> 00:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
the medical claims file for this these
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
new classes of specialty drugs that are
 
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
delivered in medical settings
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
so those exist there right now on health
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
costs we pulled the prescription drug
 
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
estimates off because of for that very
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
reason of price instability because
 
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
they're wildly variable across service
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
types and providers and that so because
 
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
it didn't meet our criteria for putting
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
a stable price estimate up there
 
00:42:26.329 --> 00:42:26.339 align:start position:0%
right we have criteria first price
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
stability and it would we found it
 
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:31.140 align:start position:0%
to be the more responsible decision yet
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
a difficult one because that for as an
 
00:42:35.329 --> 00:42:35.339 align:start position:0%
example is a public health interest and
 
00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
it's OB it's of legislative interest too
 
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
so nobody more than us would like to
 
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
have robust data on health costs for
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs but because of the
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
price instability we it's it's suspend
 
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
is taken off from there right now
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a good question
 
00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:02.290 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a good question
foreign

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:02.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.609 --> 00:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
my the second part of my question was
 
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
collaboration with other entities that
 
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
are trying to collect this data and I I
 
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
I don't really understand about the pers
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
the prescription drug costs so I think
 
00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:17.339 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
very informative to people that wanted
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
to check their thank you and I
 
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly agree with you it's it's
 
00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:27.079 align:start position:0%
probably the most pressing public health
 
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
issue in in our work right now that we'd
 
00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
like to help better inform legislative
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
bodies on there there are multiple
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
complexities to that and we
 
00:43:41.569 --> 00:43:41.579 align:start position:0%
we do collaborate with with other
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
entities and our that process is ongoing
 
00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.050 align:start position:0%
entities and our that process is ongoing
yes

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
oh okay representative Terry
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
thank you did you want to ask your
 
00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:02.220 align:start position:0%
uh so I I'm still back on representative
 
00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:05.220 align:start position:0%
gibbs's question and I'm wondering about
 
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
the Practical value to Consumers
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
when I hear representative Gibson if I'm
 
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
incorrect please
 
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
refresh my memory that you went on the
 
00:44:19.609 --> 00:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
site and you saw a range of 10 to 21
 
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
000 dollars
 
00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:23.900 align:start position:0%
for a hiatal hernia repair
 
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:26.220 align:start position:0%
they didn't actually have the procedure
 
00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:27.349 align:start position:0%
they didn't actually have the procedure
so

00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
all right so and then I heard you say
 
00:44:31.849 --> 00:44:31.859 align:start position:0%
that it actually cost you thirty seven
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
so if you would would be willing to take
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
this on as a case study to help us
 
00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
better understand how
 
00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
a consumer goes to the sites he's 10 to
 
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:46.670 align:start position:0%
a consumer goes to the sites he's 10 to
21

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
21
 
00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
000 then ends up with a bill of thirty
 
00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
seven thousand dollars I I have heard
 
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
you indicate that well there are other
 
00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:56.339 align:start position:0%
ancillary or Supportive Services that
 
00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
may go into the thirty seven thousand
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
which once again brings explanatory
 
00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
value to the difference between the
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
range of 10 to 21 and 37 but then
 
00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
reverts to my initial question which is
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
of what practical benefit in the final
 
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
analysis is a search for a particular
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
procedure when the range is 10 to 21 and
 
00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
it ends up costing 37. there needs to be
 
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:25.140 align:start position:0%
some explanation here drilling down and
 
00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
exposing the difference between the 10
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
to 21 and the 37. yes yes could you
 
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
could you respond to that please so yeah
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's one of the biggest challenges in
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
bundling a package of health care
 
00:45:40.609 --> 00:45:40.619 align:start position:0%
services for example
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
a hiatal the surgery for a hiatal hernia
 
00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
is in a hospital and presumably a
 
00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
hospital stay is involved so right there
 
00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:50.579 align:start position:0%
you have facility charges that can range
 
00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
from one day to seven days or even more
 
00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
and so that's one not trivial example of
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
yes variable yeah variable and I think
 
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.150 align:start position:0%
yes variable yeah variable and I think
it's

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:21.730 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:21.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
okay you have to talk to Mike
 
00:46:26.569 --> 00:46:26.579 align:start position:0%
unfortunately she's had hearing issues
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
Al can say it okay I have a little more
 
00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
relevance would you want to say how many
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
days you were in the hospital that day
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
for this procedure
 
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
okay uh this was this was the problem
 
00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
I stayed overnight but technically it
 
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
was outpatient surgery that's why Blue
 
00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
Cross and Medicare couldn't agree on who
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
was responsible for paying it so I
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
stayed overnight but technically it was
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
outpatient surgery I can't so hence the
 
00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
extra 10 grand is that you stayed
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
overnight excuse me
 
00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
the extra 10 grand was that did you
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
stayed overnight yeah
 
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.710 align:start position:0%
stayed overnight yeah
theoretically

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
theoretically
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
no reduced date overnight so the
 
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
hospital billed for that extra night the
 
00:47:08.329 --> 00:47:08.339 align:start position:0%
insurance company says the outpatient I
 
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
don't think that was it that that at
 
00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
least according to what they said they
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
said it was outpatient surgery even
 
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.829 align:start position:0%
said it was outpatient surgery even
though

00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:18.380 align:start position:0%
I was there I actually stayed overnight
 
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
outpatient surgery is as what they
 
00:47:23.809 --> 00:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
expected to be no but that no it was it
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
was all planned in advance
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
that you were going to say overnight yes
 
00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
but because under the billing codes or
 
00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
whatever the there's not something I can
 
00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
explain under under their system
 
00:47:38.329 --> 00:47:38.339 align:start position:0%
outpatient search surgery even though
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
everybody knew
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
from the get-go that I was going to stay
 
00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
overnight got it representative Terry
 
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
has another comments
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
did you want to finish or I just wanted
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
to repeat the questioner's point
 
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.339 align:start position:0%
um because he wasn't able to be near the
 
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
microphone but yes his point was that
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
the uh most important factor here is
 
00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.950 align:start position:0%
the uh most important factor here is
that

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:02.829 --> 00:48:02.839 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
procedure that representative Gibbs
 
00:48:08.569 --> 00:48:08.579 align:start position:0%
underwent was not
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
any procedure that was listed on health
 
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
costs she had to look at something that
 
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
she determined to be similar but
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
um that's not a reliable methodology in
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
order to be confident about what's
 
00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:24.500 align:start position:0%
posted on health costs you have to
 
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
actually have that procedure or bundle
 
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
of procedures
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
so which one should go first the one who
 
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
still has been doing this yielded to
 
00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
represent I know let's see what trouble
 
00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:39.740 align:start position:0%
that gets here
 
00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
okay because she once you give her the
 
00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
okay now representative Terry
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
so if the range is 10 to 21
 
00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
and the patient's experience is 37. what
 
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing is that there are a variety
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
of factors there are variables so you
 
00:49:08.569 --> 00:49:08.579 align:start position:0%
you can't you can't as you said in your
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
initial testimony you can't put a retail
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
price on something like if you want to
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
go buy a book on Amazon so there are a
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
variety of factors and we understand
 
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
that because this is a this is a health
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
care a complicated Health Care procedure
 
00:49:26.569 --> 00:49:26.579 align:start position:0%
might involve a number of days uh uh
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
certain types of anesthesia certain
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
other kinds of ancillary services in
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
order to to treat the patient all right
 
00:49:35.089 --> 00:49:35.099 align:start position:0%
understand so if if this is the case do
 
00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:37.859 align:start position:0%
you provide a disclaimer I've never
 
00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
visited the site because I've never had
 
00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
to do this a disclaimer that indicates
 
00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a in effect a rough
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
estimate a range uh and a rough estimate
 
00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
your actual costs may not in actuality
 
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
are likely to be significant
 
00:49:58.849 --> 00:49:58.859 align:start position:0%
significantly different than this range
 
00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
because of a multiplicity of factors
 
00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
such as yada yada yada yada otherwise
 
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
back to my initial question is and that
 
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
is how is this ever going to be
 
00:50:13.609 --> 00:50:13.619 align:start position:0%
meaningful to a consumer when there are
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
these multiple factors involved that can
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
skew the the range of 10 to 21 to as
 
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
much as 37.
 
00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:25.740 align:start position:0%
you're trying to help consumers here who
 
00:50:28.849 --> 00:50:28.859 align:start position:0%
who want to find Reliable information
 
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:32.339 align:start position:0%
is there a disclaimer is there not and
 
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
would it be helpful if there was because
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
that's effectively what I'm hearing that
 
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
because there are all these other
 
00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:40.309 align:start position:0%
because there are all these other
factors

00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
factors
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
the consumer needs to know that it could
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
be a lot more than that
 
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and the commissioner would
 
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
like to I think I think that's a point
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
and we talked earlier about uh how how
 
00:50:54.049 --> 00:50:54.059 align:start position:0%
reliable the estimate was and so for
 
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
some of those factors we have a lot of
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
billing events we're going to have a
 
00:50:58.849 --> 00:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
very reliable number and that range is
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
going to be narrower for Unique services
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
that there aren't as many occurrences
 
00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
the range or where the Acuity is more
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
severe the range is going to be bigger
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
and you're not going to have the same
 
00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
reliability and that's some of the
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
things that we balance when we're
 
00:51:14.329 --> 00:51:14.339 align:start position:0%
looking at what services to add to
 
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
health cost is we want to put services
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
on that have the best value to or or the
 
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
best use to consumers in New Hampshire
 
00:51:26.089 --> 00:51:26.099 align:start position:0%
reliability reliability thank you
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay now representative Gibbs
 
00:51:30.049 --> 00:51:30.059 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
um first of all I want to thank
 
00:51:32.809 --> 00:51:32.819 align:start position:0%
representative Terry who very clearly
 
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
articulated the point of my original
 
00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:36.470 align:start position:0%
articulated the point of my original
question

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
then my question to you is
 
00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.750 align:start position:0%
then my question to you is
um

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
considering that
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
it appeared my surgery was not a
 
00:51:51.049 --> 00:51:51.059 align:start position:0%
particularly uncommon type of surgery uh
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
because my doctor was very experienced
 
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
in it and had a whole robotic system set
 
00:51:58.130 --> 00:51:58.140 align:start position:0%
up for doing that particular type of
 
00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:59.390 align:start position:0%
up for doing that particular type of
surgery

00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
surgery
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
so one of one of the criteria we use to
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
ascertain should this service be listed
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
on health costs is the frequency of that
 
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
procedure so
 
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
not all procedures are on there we
 
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
generally put them through a litmus test
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
we identify about 100 to 120 procedures
 
00:52:27.049 --> 00:52:27.059 align:start position:0%
each quarter and then do descriptive
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
analyzes on them we analyze how
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
frequently have they occurred how common
 
00:52:35.049 --> 00:52:35.059 align:start position:0%
were the set of codes service codes
 
00:52:38.049 --> 00:52:38.059 align:start position:0%
across all encounters
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
how consistent are the bundles is what
 
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to say for that and what's
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
the price stability and if they don't
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
meet that criteria we don't add them to
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
health costs so the ones that you see
 
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
reflected on health costs have met that
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
criteria their their
 
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
produced at a certain amount of
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
frequency they're very common in terms
 
00:52:59.390 --> 00:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
of the conventions used to bundle them
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
and there's price stability and and so
 
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
it can be frustrating
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
um to look for this procedure that
 
00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
you're going to have done and not have
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
it there and wonder and call into
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
question the utility of it and we have
 
00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:18.660 align:start position:0%
those frustrations too but at the same
 
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
time we do a lot of background work to
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
do our due diligence to make sure that
 
00:53:26.809 --> 00:53:26.819 align:start position:0%
the estimates that get up there have at
 
00:53:28.849 --> 00:53:28.859 align:start position:0%
least some homogeneity to them they're
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
similar in price and they have frequency
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
they're stable compared to others so
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
before I take another question but would
 
00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be possible that you would
 
00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
do a range to have the high and low also
 
00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:42.290 align:start position:0%
do a range to have the high and low also
listed

00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
listed
 
00:53:44.329 --> 00:53:44.339 align:start position:0%
the worst case scenario in the best case
 
00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
scenario that even though you say this
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
is our average our statistical mean
 
00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
average or whatever you want to call it
 
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
but that you say but by the way this you
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
know there's a potential this procedure
 
00:53:58.010 --> 00:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
could cost x amount you know the high
 
00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
versus the low and obviously in the the
 
00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
examples that I use what you do see a
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
range that's a range of the procedures
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
that have made it onto Health costs
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
these other procedures that have not
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
been stable to make it to health costs
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
their ranges are a much more variable we
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
use a measure that I I was reluctant to
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
get into more statistical jargon but
 
00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
I'll talk to you right it's called
 
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
kurtosis it's how narrow the range is so
 
00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
we use kurtosis as the primary measure
 
00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
to ascertain whether or not it's going
 
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:35.220 align:start position:0%
to be on there something that has a
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
really wide range it's just not stable
 
00:54:41.089 --> 00:54:41.099 align:start position:0%
enough yeah but it exists yes that
 
00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
that's all I'm saying is that it um
 
00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
again I'm not an expert on statistics
 
00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
but that if you had your mean and you
 
00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:50.700 align:start position:0%
have your average but then you would say
 
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
the worst case scenario this is how high
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
that number was yes and the best case
 
00:54:58.490 --> 00:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
scenario this is how low it was not
 
00:55:00.290 --> 00:55:00.300 align:start position:0%
saying that people did but at least then
 
00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:03.020 align:start position:0%
someone can say is see their number
 
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:05.700 align:start position:0%
somewhere near that high then let's say
 
00:55:08.569 --> 00:55:08.579 align:start position:0%
okay so I obviously there was more to it
 
00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
with my particular situation
 
00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.170 align:start position:0%
with my particular situation
yeah

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:12.180 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:55:17.329 --> 00:55:17.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
this wasn't a question it was more or
 
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
less speaking directly to representative
 
00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
Gibbs and trying to help expedite this
 
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
little part
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
um your procedure is really rare it's
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
not something that happens very often
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
and so having that kind of measurable
 
00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:32.700 align:start position:0%
data in a database is just not going to
 
00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:33.530 align:start position:0%
data in a database is just not going to
happen

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
fair enough there are a lot of things
 
00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:38.940 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:55:41.089 --> 00:55:41.099 align:start position:0%
it's someone related to that what is the
 
00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
minimum end that to even be listed on
 
00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
the database
 
00:55:48.049 --> 00:55:48.059 align:start position:0%
it's expressed in this coefficient of
 
00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
variation I didn't want to get get into
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
the statistics right it's it's
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
expressing the coefficient of variation
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
so how you measure that is the very the
 
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
standard deviation divided by
 
00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
the square root of the N so that's how
 
00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
it inputs into that and so the the more
 
00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:08.300 align:start position:0%
widely variable ones are inherently
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
imposed to lower frequency of procedures
 
00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:14.460 align:start position:0%
great but do you have a do you have a
 
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
minimum to even be to be uh triggered to
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
be on the database I think it's 30.
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
so is it is it possible then that you
 
00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
may have some procedures that are so
 
00:56:26.329 --> 00:56:26.339 align:start position:0%
rare as to not even be listed on the
 
00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
database and therefore a consumer is
 
00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
going looking for it would not find what
 
00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
they're looking for yeah that's why
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
we're proud of this new federal
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
legislation because they can get that
 
00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
information now from hospital providers
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
and the carriers with these new
 
00:56:41.569 --> 00:56:41.579 align:start position:0%
transparency and care
 
00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:44.460 align:start position:0%
laws one more follow-up okay but would
 
00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:47.220 align:start position:0%
you say it's accurate that your database
 
00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
is more of a guide to a consumer rather
 
00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
than being prescriptive to a consumer as
 
00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:52.740 align:start position:0%
to what their cost is going to be yes
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
this extensive
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
um language on the website
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
describing how the methodology that we
 
00:57:02.569 --> 00:57:02.579 align:start position:0%
use if you've seen if you've seen that
 
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
you would answer a lot of questions but
 
00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
also the limitations of interpretation
 
00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
of the price estimates that you get that
 
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
this is just a range a suggestion for a
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
more precise estimate call your provider
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
or your insurance company and we we
 
00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:19.380 align:start position:0%
emphasize that language
 
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
I still think you should put the high
 
00:57:23.569 --> 00:57:23.579 align:start position:0%
and low in yeah yeah just just so so
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
when someone because most people aren't
 
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
going to look they just look at the
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
number and you know so but at any rate
 
00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:30.839 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon
 
00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:33.059 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to say I
 
00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
appreciate your presentation and I I
 
00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
being a database person I understand the
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
challenges involved with taking this
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
disparate data and trying to make it
 
00:57:43.849 --> 00:57:43.859 align:start position:0%
consumer friendly and what I'm hearing
 
00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
is that over time this system is going
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
to improve we're going to have more and
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
more transparency and then that will
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
have a benefit to the marketplace and
 
00:57:53.809 --> 00:57:53.819 align:start position:0%
the consumer so thank you for trying to
 
00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
explain this to us thank you I
 
00:57:58.730 --> 00:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
appreciate you too okay
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you this is going to lead into our
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
next subcommittee this question but do
 
00:58:05.809 --> 00:58:05.819 align:start position:0%
you feel that there's added value to the
 
00:58:09.049 --> 00:58:09.059 align:start position:0%
uh prescription drug affordability board
 
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
to the Chris database
 
00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:14.220 align:start position:0%
we don't have a position or not I think
 
00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
to the extent that uh put the mic on
 
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
your the department has no position on
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
the pdap board uh we're fortunate that
 
00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:23.540 align:start position:0%
Jason was appointed by the governor as a
 
00:58:26.329 --> 00:58:26.339 align:start position:0%
alternate member of the board uh
 
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
obviously our position on getting
 
00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
information out to New Hampshire
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
consumers is critical I think good data
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
that people can use is helpful
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
um some of the you know how how we
 
00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
deliver that and how that information
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
gets out to folks that's for you to
 
00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:39.950 align:start position:0%
gets out to folks that's for you to
decide

00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
decide
 
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
okay well then I want to follow up on
 
00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
that and that is
 
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
um given that we have a statutory
 
00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
requirement of the MRA if I got to write
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
the the 10 what do we what is that is it
 
00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:54.980 align:start position:0%
called MRA
 
00:58:58.609 --> 00:58:58.619 align:start position:0%
mlr okay so this is really important for
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
everybody this was passed on the
 
00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act or Obamacare
 
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
whichever you want to call it
 
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
um and that is that is limited a uh in
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
terms of premiums that it limited uh the
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
premium setting it's a three-year look
 
00:59:16.849 --> 00:59:16.859 align:start position:0%
back a three-year average of What uh the
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
medical costs that an insurance company
 
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
incurs so that means all the
 
00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:24.660 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical bills and all the doctors
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
and hospitals and everything is all
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
compiled and then they cannot charge
 
00:59:32.589 --> 00:59:32.599 align:start position:0%
more than 10 percent over that number
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
for that premium so that means in that
 
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
10 it's going to be their profit it's
 
00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
going to be their uh advertising costs
 
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
and operating costs and all that stuff
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
it's got to fit into that ten percent so
 
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
the reason what I'm asking is so when it
 
00:59:51.049 --> 00:59:51.059 align:start position:0%
comes to this affordable uh you guys
 
00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:54.660 align:start position:0%
actually do know exactly how much a
 
00:59:58.370 --> 00:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical costs and you do see all
 
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
the rebates and all the Kickbacks and
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
all that money that's going back and
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
forth so that when you determine the MRA
 
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
you really are getting a good number
 
01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
um I so mlr mlr and I think it's
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
typically 15 or 17 not 10. I thought it
 
01:00:16.849 --> 01:00:16.859 align:start position:0%
was 10 and 15. the record there
 
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
um and I I think we would see final
 
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
digit numbers I can't say for certain
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
that we at the department get to see
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
um total rebate dollars for prescription
 
01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:27.589 align:start position:0%
um total rebate dollars for prescription
drugs

01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
01:00:29.569 --> 01:00:29.579 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't think so how would you
 
01:00:31.609 --> 01:00:31.619 align:start position:0%
be able to who does the mlr then well
 
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
we're doing it on on Total Medical spend
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
across their their whole book whether or
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
not they're using a PBM
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
um and what that actual cost is
 
01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.130 align:start position:0%
um and what that actual cost is
um

01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:43.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
though you're not you know obviously
 
01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
we're talking be hundreds of millions of
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
lines of data if you were looking at
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
every rebate for every prescription drug
 
01:00:57.049 --> 01:00:57.059 align:start position:0%
so so the question is could there be uh
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
something that's going on outside so
 
01:01:03.049 --> 01:01:03.059 align:start position:0%
that the mlr is not truly reflecting how
 
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
much it's costing that insurance company
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
for pharmaceuticals
 
01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
no I don't if I understand your question
 
01:01:13.609 --> 01:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
uh if the true cost of pharmaceuticals
 
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
is factored into the mlr and that true
 
01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
Factor includes
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
rebates and coupons and everything I'm
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
not saying that nobody's ever messed
 
01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
that up because they have they're
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
complicated formulas but it should be
 
01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:27.299 align:start position:0%
completely represented right and and
 
01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
therefore when you set your pricing that
 
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
you're you're looking at all those
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
things are you looking at just the I
 
01:01:36.289 --> 01:01:36.299 align:start position:0%
mean I guess the whole purpose of this
 
01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:39.299 align:start position:0%
this pharmaceutical affordable was that
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
the assumption that there's some funny
 
01:01:44.809 --> 01:01:44.819 align:start position:0%
money going on behind the scenes okay
 
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
well maybe I misunderstood that I
 
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
thought the whole purpose of pdab was so
 
01:01:50.569 --> 01:01:50.579 align:start position:0%
that the board could give some direction
 
01:01:54.049 --> 01:01:54.059 align:start position:0%
to the state payers for what they should
 
01:01:57.650 --> 01:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
Target for their prescription drugs
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
um no the purpose was that the
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
Assumption the Assumption of that board
 
01:02:04.849 --> 01:02:04.859 align:start position:0%
is that there is something funny going
 
01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
on behind the scenes and they want to
 
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
know what it is and that way they can
 
01:02:12.049 --> 01:02:12.059 align:start position:0%
suggest that we would pass legislation
 
01:02:16.609 --> 01:02:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
maybe we should move on to 172. yeah
 
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.450 align:start position:0%
maybe we should move on to 172. yeah
okay

01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:22.670 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:30.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:32.809 --> 01:02:32.819 align:start position:0%
my understanding based on what you've
 
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
been saying is yes in fact you do know
 
01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:37.740 align:start position:0%
the total price of drugs and you can say
 
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
that this drug costs this amount of
 
01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:40.140 align:start position:0%
money and that's what the insurance
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
company paid for it or didn't pay for it
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
I'll cover for it
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
I think but the pdab is trying to do is
 
01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
go below that much more into the details
 
01:02:54.289 --> 01:02:54.299 align:start position:0%
of who's getting paid for what because
 
01:02:57.170 --> 01:02:57.180 align:start position:0%
if as we've been hearing is is a lot of
 
01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:58.010 align:start position:0%
if as we've been hearing is is a lot of
uh

01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
interaction between the wholesalers the
 
01:03:03.289 --> 01:03:03.299 align:start position:0%
people the pbms and the insurance
 
01:03:05.089 --> 01:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
companies and feedbacks going back and
 
01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
forth and everything but I didn't get
 
01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
the impression from what you were saying
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
that those level of details were in
 
01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
there that you were talking more about
 
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
the total cost of the drug
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
is that true I don't believe we get data
 
01:03:21.289 --> 01:03:21.299 align:start position:0%
for our rebates we get we get wholesale
 
01:03:23.809 --> 01:03:23.819 align:start position:0%
cost and then ultimately their analysis
 
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
done for mlr which is total Med spend
 
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
so that's a total
 
01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:32.819 align:start position:0%
so you can't test it by looking at your
 
01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
numbers ah well I can't extrapolate from
 
01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
that right if or not there's a rebate or
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
not okay but we
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
get the total okay representative
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
Burrows I had nothing to say Oh I
 
01:03:49.609 --> 01:03:49.619 align:start position:0%
thought you okay all right we all set
 
01:03:52.609 --> 01:03:52.619 align:start position:0%
thank you very much gentlemen thank you
 
01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:01.250 align:start position:0%
 
subcommittee

01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:04.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:33.849 --> 01:04:33.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:35.209 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:16:35.209 --> 01:16:35.219 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
all right okay let everybody take their
 
01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.169 --> 01:16:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.570 --> 01:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
so we'll start out with House Bill 172
 
01:17:01.610 --> 01:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
relative investigating potential
 
01:17:03.169 --> 01:17:03.179 align:start position:0%
redundancies between the prescription
 
01:17:05.209 --> 01:17:05.219 align:start position:0%
drug affordably board and existing state
 
01:17:07.209 --> 01:17:07.219 align:start position:0%
aging programs
 
01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
regarding prescription drug cost data so
 
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
I just spoke to the uh
 
01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
not to sponsor the anti-sponsor the
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
opposite side and uh um I agreed that uh
 
01:17:23.209 --> 01:17:23.219 align:start position:0%
we'll just retain this so that we can
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
understand better what's what the intent
 
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
of the bill is since maybe we don't have
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
the same perception but I I want to go
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
on record that
 
01:17:36.649 --> 01:17:36.659 align:start position:0%
um I would just assume uh I if I were to
 
01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
pass something I would have uh just
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
assumed to remove the assessments on
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
these companies on the insurance
 
01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
companies in particular because it it
 
01:17:48.649 --> 01:17:48.659 align:start position:0%
seems an oxymoron to me that if we're
 
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
trying to lower our health insurance
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
costs why would we then be adding a new
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
tax onto insurance companies
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
um having said that uh the
 
01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:01.729 align:start position:0%
um having said that uh the
um

01:18:01.729 --> 01:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
the the uh and and that where the I
 
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
would say that if they need money they
 
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
should go to finance it should be in the
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
governor's budget you know but uh I
 
01:18:16.729 --> 01:18:16.739 align:start position:0%
guess maybe Tom Tom you know the
 
01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
governor doesn't answer your phone calls
 
01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:22.510 align:start position:0%
governor doesn't answer your phone calls
Maybe

01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:24.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:18:24.189 --> 01:18:24.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
maybe that happened so but be acutely
 
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
aware of that maybe that might be some
 
01:18:34.189 --> 01:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
some uh past uh issues there but but
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
um but I I also I have to admit I was a
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
little shocked that AARP is coming in in
 
01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and supporting this
 
01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
commission when they're the ones who own
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
their own insurance company they have
 
01:18:49.729 --> 01:18:49.739 align:start position:0%
their own insurance product so you would
 
01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
think that AARP could get all that
 
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
information that so-called black box
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
from just calling up U.S Healthcare
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
their their provider so uh but
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding that uh I know that the
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
legislation was originally initiated by
 
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
new Futures and uh and I know that
 
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
they're a private foundation with Oodles
 
01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
of money
 
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
um and so therefore I think that that if
 
01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
they really want to do this in partially
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
those two entities should help fund or
 
01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
they can go out to other funds so I
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
haven't limited just simply to remove
 
01:19:27.169 --> 01:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
the money and to uh just have that the
 
01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
money go through Finance you know if
 
01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
we're going to do appropriation
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise create a fund so that people
 
01:19:34.450 --> 01:19:34.460 align:start position:0%
can make donations to it
 
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding um I've agreed to retain
 
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
this bill but I just want you to know
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm thinking about when we
 
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
get to it next time next spring do we
 
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
not need a vote from the subcommittee on
 
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
whether to retain yes yes I'm
 
01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
recommending okay because you said I'm
 
01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
in the very old days when retaining was
 
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
originally created
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
when they're when the retaining was
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
originally created the chair
 
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
could just unilaterally say from the
 
01:20:06.530 --> 01:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
sense of the conversation and where I
 
01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
think we are that retaining but
 
01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
obviously there would have to be a
 
01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
conversation you can't just say I have a
 
01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
sense you know I just pull a sentence
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not that sensitive no right but
 
01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
um so I if it sounds like I'm I'm uh
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
dictating the retaining no I'm assuming
 
01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
that um everyone would be
 
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
um comfortable with a retaining option
 
01:20:29.330 --> 01:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
do you want to ask if there's any
 
01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
discussion from anybody oh yeah no I
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
haven't made any motion yet okay you're
 
01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
not there you even made the motion yet
 
01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
we haven't we haven't haven't I don't
 
01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
even know if I had the subcommittee
 
01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:38.510 align:start position:0%
even know if I had the subcommittee
worksheets

01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
worksheets
 
01:20:41.209 --> 01:20:41.219 align:start position:0%
who has the subcommittee worksheet Terry
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay you have the subcommittee worksheet
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
I I sometimes
 
01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
I see it okay
 
01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
um the subcommittee is uh representative
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
Terry post purcelli hunt collabro
 
01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
Vincent Sullivan and Burroughs
 
01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
that's the old list okay
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
I thought I had a pen oh here it is I
 
01:21:09.530 --> 01:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
have a pen I got a pen
 
01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
okay so on this one Vincent is no longer
 
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
on it
 
01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:16.430 align:start position:0%
on it
right

01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:19.250 align:start position:0%
right
yeah

01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
and Gibbs is I thought oh
 
01:21:24.649 --> 01:21:24.659 align:start position:0%
Sullivan is no longer on it Gibbs
 
01:21:24.659 --> 01:21:26.149 align:start position:0%
Sullivan is no longer on it Gibbs
replaced

01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
replaced
 
01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
okay am I all am I all correct in the
 
01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
red is everybody else the correct list
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
it was just that those two that I
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
switched okay I gotta talk to Carrie
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
about that okay
 
01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:45.229 align:start position:0%
about that okay
so

01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:45.239 --> 01:21:45.950 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
I I I moved to uh retain
 
01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
and do I hear a second for routine uh
 
01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:59.270 align:start position:0%
and do I hear a second for routine uh
okay

01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:22:00.410 --> 01:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:11.290 --> 01:22:11.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully I can still do parliamentary
 
01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
process problems okay I see no
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
discussion on the uh retained motion so
 
01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
all those in favor just raise your hand
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six seven okay
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:40.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
moving right along all right relative to
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage for pain management
 
01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:51.770 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage for pain management
surfaces

01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
and so I'm now Crossing out Sullivan and
 
01:22:59.570 --> 01:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:14.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
this is the one that's got every
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:29.159 --> 01:23:30.950 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:32.450 align:start position:0%
right
people

01:23:32.450 --> 01:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:37.669 align:start position:0%
people
today

01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:40.490 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:23:40.490 --> 01:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:42.770 --> 01:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
given a lot of insurance companies
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
um and a and b that for us to cover
 
01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
things why don't you do that you must
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
have a mouth in your bag
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
and given that we have
 
01:23:59.040 --> 01:23:59.570 align:start position:0%
and given that we have
um

01:23:59.570 --> 01:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
some things here that don't even have
 
01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:05.030 align:start position:0%
some things here that don't even have
credentialing

01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
credentialing
 
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
right well I used to I used to say that
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
um I mean I'll I go back to uh it was
 
01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
laidak licensed alcohol and drug that
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
they first they went one year they went
 
01:24:24.770 --> 01:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
to Edna
 
01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:26.900 align:start position:0%
to get licensed
 
01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
right because it was they were a new
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
thing there was it's a new kind of
 
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
mental health that came out of nowhere
 
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
and so they went there and got licensed
 
01:24:35.630 --> 01:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
and then the following year they came
 
01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:36.530 align:start position:0%
and then the following year they came
here

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:24:38.630 --> 01:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
for us to give them third-party
 
01:24:42.530 --> 01:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
insurance reimbursement and I said so so
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
I go to the Edna say don't license these
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
people because they'll be running up to
 
01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
Congress the following year
 
01:24:53.090 --> 01:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
so the question is is is there really
 
01:24:55.610 --> 01:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
anything we can do that with this bill
 
01:24:58.370 --> 01:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
it is a health insurance mandate which
 
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
generally most of us are are a little uh
 
01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
you know that's adding more Health costs
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
amount I mean I think one point in time
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
um Tyler Brennan who's no longer here
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
with insurance you know but he he said
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
it was about five percent mandates
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
five mandates were about five percent of
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
the health insurance costs which is you
 
01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
know in the scheme of things not much
 
01:25:21.229 --> 01:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
um and certainly not as as compared to
 
01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals as they are now but that
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
the idea of adding uh going through this
 
01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
when the marketplace seems to be picking
 
01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
these things up so representative spear
 
01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:37.010 align:start position:0%
these things up so representative spear
I

01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
I took the most there is something there
 
01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
are some insurance companies now that
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
covers acupuncture yeah but it's it's a
 
01:25:45.290 --> 01:25:45.300 align:start position:0%
very limited basis and for instance if
 
01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
you're on Medicare you can only get it
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
for back injury there's only a couple of
 
01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
things you can get it from appreciate
 
01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
you bringing that up so remember when we
 
01:25:56.810 --> 01:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
do these health insurance mandates
 
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
we're only covering about a third of the
 
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
state's population okay because anybody
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
who is on Medicare or Medicaid or an
 
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
erisa self you know employer provided
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
package they are exempt but John what a
 
01:26:15.050 --> 01:26:15.060 align:start position:0%
lot of companies do is they if Medicare
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
only covers
 
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
um so uh having sat on this seat
 
01:26:25.129 --> 01:26:25.139 align:start position:0%
longer than I probably should have
 
01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
bought it right
 
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
um I would say that I have it's an
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
interesting Trend what happens with
 
01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
companies and one of the big companies
 
01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
that I really follow is the state
 
01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:37.430 align:start position:0%
that I really follow is the state
employees

01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
and I'll never forget when we had we
 
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
passed the um coverage for family
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
members of who were under 26.
 
01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
and and used to be the law used to be
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
that insurance companies would keep them
 
01:26:53.770 --> 01:26:53.780 align:start position:0%
on as long as they were in a full-time
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
Academic Program
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
and then there was some like if you go
 
01:26:59.629 --> 01:26:59.639 align:start position:0%
to beauty school that wasn't included
 
01:27:01.729 --> 01:27:01.739 align:start position:0%
and that you know we so we got to push
 
01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
back on that so when we ended up passing
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
that that meant they get passed but the
 
01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
state employees didn't they didn't have
 
01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:09.900 align:start position:0%
it so I would hear every time I would
 
01:27:11.149 --> 01:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
hear somebody complaining about it I
 
01:27:12.890 --> 01:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
knew exactly that they were where they
 
01:27:14.689 --> 01:27:14.699 align:start position:0%
were coming from because that was one of
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
the few entities but eventually once uh
 
01:27:19.729 --> 01:27:19.739 align:start position:0%
the Affordable Care Act was passed that
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
now is across the board
 
01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
um and and and covers even erises erises
 
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
can be very creative
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
um small employer I mean a large
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
employers or risks they can be very
 
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
creative in doing different programs and
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
but that again that's usually Union
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
generated if they're have a union job or
 
01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
it's generated from that they really
 
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
want to do that for their employees so
 
01:27:45.890 --> 01:27:45.900 align:start position:0%
um but again that we we don't regulate
 
01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
that rises are federally regulated so
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
that in general we try to very limit the
 
01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
amount of things we do in this bill if
 
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
you look at the way the bill is written
 
01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm not looking at it but I'm sure
 
01:27:59.570 --> 01:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
it's going to be in different sections
 
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
of the law so you a you it's the small
 
01:28:04.729 --> 01:28:04.739 align:start position:0%
group market and then it's the non-group
 
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
or what we call the individual Market
 
01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
the marketplace as we know it today so
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
um that that would be the the next
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph that these are the different
 
01:28:15.649 --> 01:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
paragraphs it would cover so my I I'd
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
say at this point
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
I mean we could retain it and talk about
 
01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
and say is there something we want to
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
pick and choose but
 
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm not sold on that that in the
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
insurance company won't offer it if if
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a demand or want
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
desire for it representative Terry so
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
having heard your recommendation Mr
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
chairman or your suggested
 
01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:36.169 align:start position:0%
chairman or your suggested
recommendation

01:28:36.169 --> 01:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:28:38.330 --> 01:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that I have
 
01:28:40.129 --> 01:28:40.139 align:start position:0%
mentioned to colleagues when they've
 
01:28:41.689 --> 01:28:41.699 align:start position:0%
asked us about our committee process is
 
01:28:43.129 --> 01:28:43.139 align:start position:0%
that when we get to the subcommittee
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
level and they hear what the feedback is
 
01:28:48.169 --> 01:28:48.179 align:start position:0%
from the committee that they would have
 
01:28:50.689 --> 01:28:50.699 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to uh to respond to that
 
01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
not argument scores to appeal I'm
 
01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
wondering if representative I believe
 
01:28:55.850 --> 01:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel is here I wonder if
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
he has any thoughts on base on what he
 
01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
is so please come up to the mic because
 
01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
I I'm sort of after having talked with
 
01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
him I'm sort of inclined in being
 
01:29:07.970 --> 01:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
favorably disposed not necessarily to to
 
01:29:10.370 --> 01:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh to favor the bill but to retain it
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
retain it for further information so
 
01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Terry thank you
 
01:29:18.530 --> 01:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt
 
01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:19.490 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt
um

01:29:19.490 --> 01:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
you pretty much took the words out of my
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
mouth there is a parallel bill
 
01:29:26.090 --> 01:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
um that we're seeing in Health and Human
 
01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
Services to create a committee to um
 
01:29:31.129 --> 01:29:31.139 align:start position:0%
discuss this bill in Greater detail
 
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
we've met with the insurance
 
01:29:35.209 --> 01:29:35.219 align:start position:0%
Representatives we've met with all the
 
01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:36.780 align:start position:0%
providers that are involved in this
 
01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
issue we acknowledge that there's some
 
01:29:41.570 --> 01:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
issues with this bill but we think that
 
01:29:44.050 --> 01:29:44.060 align:start position:0%
as a group we can work on it together
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
therefore we would like to retain that
 
01:29:51.169 --> 01:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
proceed in that way and then get back to
 
01:29:51.179 --> 01:29:53.890 align:start position:0%
proceed in that way and then get back to
you

01:29:53.890 --> 01:29:53.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
yep representative Calabro I wanted to
 
01:29:59.570 --> 01:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
move to retain it I was talking with Dr
 
01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
Neagle and the elements that were
 
01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
problematic I think can be ironed out
 
01:30:06.770 --> 01:30:06.780 align:start position:0%
okay so great thank you so is there
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the audience who uh
 
01:30:12.050 --> 01:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
thinks differently about retaining
 
01:30:16.610 --> 01:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
okay so uh uh representative Calabro
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Terry moose
 
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh to retain
 
01:30:28.910 --> 01:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the motion
 
01:30:32.689 --> 01:30:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
okay so uh retaining bills means that we
 
01:30:38.689 --> 01:30:38.699 align:start position:0%
will be discussing him in the fall
 
01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
and that we would have to have this out
 
01:30:44.570 --> 01:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
of committee uh the last week of August
 
01:30:46.610 --> 01:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
I mean October excuse me anybody have a
 
01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
calendar you can see what the date is
 
01:30:50.090 --> 01:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
but it's usually the end of last the end
 
01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
of October and that means it will hit
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
the house floor
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
um uh the first week of January
 
01:31:00.649 --> 01:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
so that's one week you don't want to
 
01:31:00.659 --> 01:31:01.669 align:start position:0%
so that's one week you don't want to
miss

01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
miss
 
01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
because all the bills that were retained
 
01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
will reappear that first week
 
01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:08.940 align:start position:0%
yeah first because it's always funny
 
01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
because Ed Butler would always take go
 
01:31:12.649 --> 01:31:12.659 align:start position:0%
to New York that week and I said he said
 
01:31:14.810 --> 01:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
why would you miss out on that week but
 
01:31:17.629 --> 01:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
yeah so representative purcelli
 
01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:19.510 align:start position:0%
if there is
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:24.169 align:start position:0%
if there is
[Music]

01:31:24.169 --> 01:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:26.330 --> 01:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
to study this
 
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
outcome from that committee to we would
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
be we would be interested in knowing
 
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
what happened so are they turning it
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
into a chapter study or are they what
 
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
are they planning on doing what kind of
 
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
a committee are they talk are they they
 
01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:40.739 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
there's two kinds of committees or
 
01:31:45.649 --> 01:31:45.659 align:start position:0%
there's what we said a is retaining an
 
01:31:47.810 --> 01:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
interim an interim study is technically
 
01:31:49.729 --> 01:31:49.739 align:start position:0%
a study committee but you're study we
 
01:31:51.410 --> 01:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
keep it in the committee
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
you can do a chapter study
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
um and which generally the chapter
 
01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
studies would include legislators House
 
01:32:01.129 --> 01:32:01.139 align:start position:0%
and Senate members and we generally say
 
01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
you don't want to do that the second
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
year because that would be campaign
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
season and nobody wants to show up and
 
01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:09.060 align:start position:0%
the third thing is a commission study
 
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
commission and that way you get uh
 
01:32:14.209 --> 01:32:14.219 align:start position:0%
participants from the different
 
01:32:14.219 --> 01:32:15.169 align:start position:0%
participants from the different
um

01:32:15.169 --> 01:32:15.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
the people it's people in constituency
 
01:32:19.729 --> 01:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
would be be involved and they all have
 
01:32:19.739 --> 01:32:20.930 align:start position:0%
would be be involved and they all have
input

01:32:20.930 --> 01:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
input
 
01:32:23.450 --> 01:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
um I always say that uh over my years
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
that uh study those commissions was the
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
best way to really make sure nothing
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
gets done because everybody's
 
01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's got their own extra grind
 
01:32:35.090 --> 01:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
and so so uh and and so over my years
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
I've only did that once and that was
 
01:32:40.250 --> 01:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
over a privacy issue so some further
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
clarification the committee yes who is
 
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:51.050 --> 01:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
so what is it you guys already the
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
committee will have I'm sorry doc uh
 
01:32:55.490 --> 01:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant is the reason
 
01:32:57.770 --> 01:32:57.780 align:start position:0%
I'm the passion so
 
01:32:59.870 --> 01:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
um he has all the details on that but
 
01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:00.709 align:start position:0%
um he has all the details on that but
it's

01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
um there were going to be two senators
 
01:33:05.209 --> 01:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
three reps um we pretty much already
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
discussed who those people would be the
 
01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
plan would be to meet this summer have
 
01:33:11.090 --> 01:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
something to you by the fall right so
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
that's a chapter study committee so um
 
01:33:16.850 --> 01:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
so theoretically their results wouldn't
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
come out until the same time where we
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
you know actually a chapter studies get
 
01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
an extra month I think they can they
 
01:33:26.450 --> 01:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
finally can report in December but
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
um so theoretically would be parallel to
 
01:33:31.370 --> 01:33:31.380 align:start position:0%
that so we would be waiting to hear if
 
01:33:33.290 --> 01:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
if there's anything came out of it and
 
01:33:35.689 --> 01:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
then we would then could take it up in
 
01:33:37.850 --> 01:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
our subcommittee with that said we're
 
01:33:40.129 --> 01:33:40.139 align:start position:0%
all one happy family now so this will be
 
01:33:43.330 --> 01:33:43.340 align:start position:0%
an ongoing discussion anyways
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay everybody all set
 
01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh so that's Terry post purcelli
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
hunt collabro Vincent's not here and
 
01:33:55.850 --> 01:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
Gibbs and Burrows so all those in favor
 
01:34:01.490 --> 01:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:04.010 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:34:04.010 --> 01:34:04.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:15.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee uh let's see
 
01:34:19.729 --> 01:34:19.739 align:start position:0%

okay

01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:32.930 --> 01:34:32.940 align:start position:0%

01:36:16.729 --> 01:36:16.739 align:start position:0%
um is not in reference to
 
01:36:19.250 --> 01:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
a Canadian Health System it's in
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
reference to what's being done in the
 
01:36:24.290 --> 01:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
states of Maryland Pennsylvania and
 
01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
looked at but actually Vermont in a
 
01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
different way is in reference to what's
 
01:36:31.729 --> 01:36:31.739 align:start position:0%
called an all-payer
 
01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:34.860 align:start position:0%
health system which is very relevant to
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
the um what you've just heard testimony
 
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
from the insurance department
 
01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
so by the way as a as a physician I've
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
been on the uh the New Hampshire Health
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
cost site
 
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the efforts of the
 
01:36:52.669 --> 01:36:52.679 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
but what affects people's uh bankruptcy
 
01:37:01.129 --> 01:37:01.139 align:start position:0%
and uh affordability are procedures the
 
01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
only procedure mentioned
 
01:37:05.209 --> 01:37:05.219 align:start position:0%
was an arthroscopy it doesn't mention
 
01:37:08.330 --> 01:37:08.340 align:start position:0%
common procedures bypass surgery it
 
01:37:09.610 --> 01:37:09.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't mention
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
other common procedures that are
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
extraordinary in cost
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
um you can go to a charge Master with
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
the insurance department was able to
 
01:37:19.610 --> 01:37:19.620 align:start position:0%
provide you are you speaking to this
 
01:37:21.410 --> 01:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
Bill yes this is relevant to this bill
 
01:37:24.890 --> 01:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
so there's so I'll speed it along sorry
 
01:37:27.229 --> 01:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
if you go to that Health site you'll see
 
01:37:29.689 --> 01:37:29.699 align:start position:0%
huge discrepancies because what was not
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned this morning is private
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
insurers negotiate separately behind
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
closed doors for those costs that's why
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
I suppose this is on the Commerce
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee's lab
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
health care costs however
 
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
you're not consuming having a hiatal
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
hernia repair
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
like you consume an apple when you go to
 
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
the produce department at the at the
 
01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:53.810 align:start position:0%
the produce department at the at the
grocery

01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
grocery
 
01:37:56.930 --> 01:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
you are receiving Health Care
 
01:37:58.970 --> 01:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
listening to the Commerce Committee
 
01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:00.229 align:start position:0%
listening to the Commerce Committee
discuss

01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
these matters is like putting a square
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
peg into a round hole it's bizarre
 
01:38:11.330 --> 01:38:11.340 align:start position:0%
the efforts to try to incorporate all
 
01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
the intricacies of health care costs
 
01:38:17.090 --> 01:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
when you have private insurers who are
 
01:38:19.729 --> 01:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
opaque to how they're negotiating costs
 
01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
behind closed doors is bizarre it's
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
never going to happen but I appreciate
 
01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
their efforts so what all-pair system
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
modeled on the Maryland model does
 
01:38:36.590 --> 01:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
is it sets a single cost
 
01:38:39.370 --> 01:38:39.380 align:start position:0%
for every hospital and
 
01:38:42.169 --> 01:38:42.179 align:start position:0%
hospital-associated procedure
 
01:38:45.490 --> 01:38:45.500 align:start position:0%
made by Medicaid
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
Medicare and every employer sponsored
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
Insurance there is one cost per Hospital
 
01:38:54.110 --> 01:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
not every hospital will have the same
 
01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:55.370 align:start position:0%
not every hospital will have the same
cost

01:38:55.370 --> 01:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth which has a tertiary Care
 
01:39:00.050 --> 01:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
Center a neonatal ICU has different
 
01:39:02.570 --> 01:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
costs and demands than Cottage Hospital
 
01:39:06.850 --> 01:39:06.860 align:start position:0%
20 miles away each Hospital
 
01:39:09.970 --> 01:39:09.980 align:start position:0%
negotiates with
 
01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire agency typically run in
 
01:39:17.090 --> 01:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
concert with the insurance department to
 
01:39:21.110 --> 01:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
set a single transparent cost for every
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
one of those procedures that you folks
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
were trying to figure out this morning
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
that incentivizes doctors to take
 
01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so it's not a third class
 
01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
citizenship it incentivizes the
 
01:39:36.169 --> 01:39:36.179 align:start position:0%
hospitals to take Medicaid where they'll
 
01:39:39.410 --> 01:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
try to put these patients on the uh out
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
of the or so you're going to be paid
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
Higher by the insurance company for the
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
same knee replacement it incentivizes
 
01:39:50.209 --> 01:39:50.219 align:start position:0%
primary care which is a lost leader how
 
01:39:53.810 --> 01:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
does it incentivize it so the important
 
01:39:56.450 --> 01:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair uh chairman
 
01:39:56.460 --> 01:39:58.010 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair uh chairman
hunt

01:39:58.010 --> 01:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
hunt
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
right now hospitals make their revenue
 
01:40:05.209 --> 01:40:05.219 align:start position:0%
in which they sit on large revenues as
 
01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
you all know non-profit hospitals I'm
 
01:40:08.330 --> 01:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
make their revenue by seeking out those
 
01:40:13.250 --> 01:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
procedures which give them the most
 
01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
money that makes sense but they're
 
01:40:18.169 --> 01:40:18.179 align:start position:0%
non-profit they're tax exempt so that's
 
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
why you see the advertisements for
 
01:40:21.050 --> 01:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
getting your knee replaced you're hip
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
replaced having your bypass surgery
 
01:40:25.370 --> 01:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
there those are big bucks because they
 
01:40:28.370 --> 01:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
negotiate far above what Medicare pays
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
for those procedures
 
01:40:33.709 --> 01:40:33.719 align:start position:0%
on the other hand those same hospitals
 
01:40:35.209 --> 01:40:35.219 align:start position:0%
that have bought out Primary Care
 
01:40:35.219 --> 01:40:37.550 align:start position:0%
that have bought out Primary Care
practices

01:40:37.550 --> 01:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
practices
 
01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:39.719 align:start position:0%
those Primary Care practices get paid
 
01:40:42.410 --> 01:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
what Medicare provides 10 percent more
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
at maximum so they have no incentive to
 
01:40:47.810 --> 01:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
have you go to see your doctor to
 
01:40:50.209 --> 01:40:50.219 align:start position:0%
discuss your high cholesterol or manage
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
your diabetes or help you motivate to
 
01:40:54.590 --> 01:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
quit smoking so you don't need your
 
01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
bypass surgery
 
01:40:57.649 --> 01:40:57.659 align:start position:0%
because they make more money off the
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
bypass surgery it is a lost leader this
 
01:41:03.110 --> 01:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
is the intricacy of Health Care why it's
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
before the Commerce Committee is is
 
01:41:07.010 --> 01:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
you're going to answer my question how
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
no I just answered it so I'll answer it
 
01:41:13.070 --> 01:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
again hospitals are incentivized to make
 
01:41:15.890 --> 01:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
Revenue off of high paying procedures
 
01:41:17.629 --> 01:41:17.639 align:start position:0%
today you're saying that's what's going
 
01:41:19.790 --> 01:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
on now that is the current reality how
 
01:41:22.430 --> 01:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
does this bill incentivize hospitals to
 
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
be cheaper by by oh so that's really
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
important number one it sets a price
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
for that it helps negotiate what the
 
01:41:35.169 --> 01:41:35.179 align:start position:0%
prices for Cottage Hospital Littleton
 
01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire if there's an
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
agency that works with the insurance
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
companies the private insurance
 
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
companies works with Medicaid works with
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
Medicare and sets a uniform price for
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
that hospital which is lower in in
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
average to what they are getting paid by
 
01:41:56.450 --> 01:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
the employee sponsored insurances it
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
lowers your premiums by the way it
 
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
lowers your deductibles the data is
 
01:42:04.490 --> 01:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
clear how does it do it go to the total
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
cost of care in Maryland site it's easy
 
01:42:10.750 --> 01:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
to do it's on a website they saved
 
01:42:14.930 --> 01:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
Medicare alone 1.2 billion dollars this
 
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
is in billions of dollars how does it do
 
01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:20.580 align:start position:0%
it it's set by lowering the cost overall
 
01:42:23.290 --> 01:42:23.300 align:start position:0%
to a uniform Level Playing Field
 
01:42:25.609 --> 01:42:25.619 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so at the end of the day the
 
01:42:28.250 --> 01:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
hospital cost is going to get lowered
 
01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
price of the service by the hospital to
 
01:42:34.430 --> 01:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
all insurers is identical whether you're
 
01:42:37.129 --> 01:42:37.139 align:start position:0%
a Medicaid Medicare or employee and it
 
01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
is an average number no way in my mind
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
that they could be used well you should
 
01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid because I'm my understanding no
 
01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
no it raises the price to Medicaid which
 
01:42:47.090 --> 01:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
is why hospitals are interested that
 
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
means raise the cost to the state
 
01:42:52.490 --> 01:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
go ahead you have a question no that's
 
01:42:54.410 --> 01:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
not true it lowers the price of the
 
01:42:56.450 --> 01:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
state wait a minute wait a minute okay
 
01:42:59.770 --> 01:42:59.780 align:start position:0%
how can that be you can't be both
 
01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative question well no uh
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
well I appreciate the colloquy uh in
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
which you are engaged with the the man
 
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
who's testifying the doctor
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
um but I believe that the the bill
 
01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
establishes a committee to study an
 
01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
all-payer system that's correct your
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
initial question is Iraq call Mr
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
chairman was was this a Canadian model
 
01:43:24.169 --> 01:43:24.179 align:start position:0%
in the response at the beginning of the
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
of the uh testimony or the response to
 
01:43:29.689 --> 01:43:29.699 align:start position:0%
the question since we're not in formal
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
testimony today was no this is modeled
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
after State systems such as the Maryland
 
01:43:37.370 --> 01:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
system or the Pennsylvania system you
 
01:43:39.169 --> 01:43:39.179 align:start position:0%
have to have anybody from Maryland so my
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
understanding is you know not so much
 
01:43:42.530 --> 01:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
here today to debate the merits of an
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
all-payer system as to whether or not we
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
even want to bother to have it studied
 
01:43:49.490 --> 01:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
as to its applicability
 
01:43:51.070 --> 01:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
um here in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'm clear on that that's correct this is
 
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
just this study and so if that's the
 
01:43:57.050 --> 01:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
question then I would have a question if
 
01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
I may
 
01:44:00.169 --> 01:44:00.179 align:start position:0%
um who are the police refresh my memory
 
01:44:03.050 --> 01:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
who are the constituent members of the
 
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
study committee who appoints them and
 
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
when is the report done okay I have that

to receive mileage and so basically and
 
01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
then the Commissioner of Health yeah
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
just so you know why I did that okay
 
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
remember I started out with a study
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
committee would be just legislators and
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
Senate a commission
 
01:45:16.850 --> 01:45:16.860 align:start position:0%
which is this doesn't say a commission
 
01:45:19.370 --> 01:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
but that's what it is okay because it
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
then has the whole Myriad of interested
 
01:45:23.930 --> 01:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
parties in there
 
01:45:25.970 --> 01:45:25.980 align:start position:0%
well these are these are no no but these
 
01:45:28.490 --> 01:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
are folks to be called upon for
 
01:45:33.129 --> 01:45:33.139 align:start position:0%
information the committee is a is a uh
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
we shall solicit the information and
 
01:45:38.090 --> 01:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
testimony from these people correct I
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
gotcha I did not see that do we have a
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
due date for the report the due date
 
01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
would probably be the end of the uh
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
November uh due days November 1st so
 
01:45:48.649 --> 01:45:48.659 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that essentially
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
you'd be studying the Maryland system
 
01:45:52.609 --> 01:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
the Pennsylvania system whatever and and
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not it would have uh any
 
01:45:58.370 --> 01:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
favorable applicability to the unique
 
01:46:01.850 --> 01:46:01.860 align:start position:0%
state that we are in distinction we have
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
similarities but differences with
 
01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
respect to those two states that I just
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
cited correct and not to engage in
 
01:46:11.149 --> 01:46:11.159 align:start position:0%
caliloquy but I do think it's worthwhile
 
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
pointing out that we have pricing
 
01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
failures in this aspect of Health Care
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
your premiums may go down a little bit
 
01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
next year because of covid but the
 
01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
insurance commission has an annual
 
01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
report of the cost of premiums in New
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the cost of deductibles
 
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
that is you pay
 
01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars a year to get
 
01:46:34.729 --> 01:46:34.739 align:start position:0%
your health insurance but then you have
 
01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
to pay five thousand dollars to pay for
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
that procedure that you've just paid so
 
01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
there's an ex a pricing failure that is
 
01:46:44.090 --> 01:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
due to the opaqueness of this
 
01:46:46.609 --> 01:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
negotiations between pbms as well as
 
01:46:49.729 --> 01:46:49.739 align:start position:0%
hospitals and and private insurers all
 
01:46:53.689 --> 01:46:53.699 align:start position:0%
uh the price is actually determined by
 
01:46:56.030 --> 01:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
this uh and and as well taken this will
 
01:46:58.609 --> 01:46:58.619 align:start position:0%
be studied but the reason prices go down
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
is they are set lower than what they are
 
01:47:03.050 --> 01:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
currently that is but satisfies the
 
01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
insurers who are not objectionable to
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
this in Maryland nor the hospitals who
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
are not objecting to this in Maryland in
 
01:47:12.050 --> 01:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
fact they had protection during covid
 
01:47:14.090 --> 01:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
when they had their Global budgets
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
enabled them to to weather the coveted
 
01:47:20.030 --> 01:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
disaster for their revenues so there's a
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
lot of things that are favorable
 
01:47:25.970 --> 01:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
it's who's went up
 
01:47:28.370 --> 01:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
excuse if no if it's not acceptable to
 
01:47:31.930 --> 01:47:31.940 align:start position:0%
nobody's Fighters objectives
 
01:47:35.090 --> 01:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
went down it's not a free everybody
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
actually happens in the rest of the
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
world we pay twice the cost of every
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
other Every Other Nation on Earth so can
 
01:47:43.970 --> 01:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
you lower the price of American medical
 
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
program that we have high deductibles
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
that we were the highest deductible this
 
01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
is the bill that you were talking about
 
01:47:52.669 --> 01:47:52.679 align:start position:0%
yes we in in 2021
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
um we were the second highest cost of
 
01:47:58.010 --> 01:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
deductibles in New Hampshire in the
 
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
country who do you think decides what
 
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
the deductible should be who do you
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
think does this insurance company no the
 
01:48:07.490 --> 01:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
employer the employer looks at the
 
01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
premium and looks at the deductible and
 
01:48:13.310 --> 01:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
then makes a debt decision how much
 
01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
deductible they want to you know how
 
01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
much they think they can suffer onto
 
01:48:19.729 --> 01:48:19.739 align:start position:0%
their employees they can afford from the
 
01:48:22.370 --> 01:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
insurance company right they the
 
01:48:25.010 --> 01:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
insurance company runs what will set the
 
01:48:28.090 --> 01:48:28.100 align:start position:0%
price to that employer to the deductible
 
01:48:31.010 --> 01:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
and the premium they're directly related
 
01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
okay in other words if I wanted if I
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to lower my deductible
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
as an employer if I want to lower my
 
01:48:41.689 --> 01:48:41.699 align:start position:0%
deductibles to my employees I just have
 
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
to pay a higher monthly premium chairman
 
01:48:46.189 --> 01:48:46.199 align:start position:0%
hunt you're absolutely correct in what
 
01:48:48.290 --> 01:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
you're saying okay what we're saying is
 
01:48:52.490 --> 01:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
that the total cost of Health Care to an
 
01:48:55.609 --> 01:48:55.619 align:start position:0%
employer or to an employee is based is
 
01:48:57.290 --> 01:48:57.300 align:start position:0%
is set by the insurance company the
 
01:48:58.910 --> 01:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
insurance company says look we're going
 
01:49:01.010 --> 01:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
to make thirty thousand dollars a year
 
01:49:03.970 --> 01:49:03.980 align:start position:0%
off of you chairman of chairman hunt
 
01:49:06.290 --> 01:49:06.300 align:start position:0%
either through the deduct through the
 
01:49:08.570 --> 01:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
premium or the deductible we can lower
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
your premium and raise your deductible
 
01:49:12.890 --> 01:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
and meet that thirty thousand dollars a
 
01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
year or we can lower your raise your
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
premium and lower your deductible so
 
01:49:21.890 --> 01:49:21.900 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is as an employee or
 
01:49:24.410 --> 01:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
employer I can determine which of those
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
two programs I want but from the
 
01:49:28.490 --> 01:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
insurance company they don't care
 
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
because they're making the thirty
 
01:49:32.209 --> 01:49:32.219 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year off of you and
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
your employee regardless of which plan
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:42.590 --> 01:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
but again that the individual the
 
01:49:44.209 --> 01:49:44.219 align:start position:0%
individual business is the one who's
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
making that decision so if you were to
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
say to me why do we have so many so what
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
you're saying is is that in Maryland
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
they have they don't have a five
 
01:49:54.649 --> 01:49:54.659 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar deductible so there's
 
01:49:56.330 --> 01:49:56.340 align:start position:0%
another issue which isn't which is
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
related to this that I want to discuss
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
with you
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
in short medical insurers are actually
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
like a utility
 
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
they get the opportunity the ACA set
 
01:50:13.250 --> 01:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
that they can take aside 20 of revenues
 
01:50:15.590 --> 01:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
taken from premiums and deductibles and
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
co-pays all the various tools
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
coinsurance if you wish to call all the
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
various tools that are that a health
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
insurer creates to get revenue from
 
01:50:28.669 --> 01:50:28.679 align:start position:0%
from that they they must expend 80
 
01:50:33.050 --> 01:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
percent of that on actual medical care
 
01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
so the healthcare dollar actually goes
 
01:50:36.350 --> 01:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
to Medical Care the rest of that 20
 
01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:37.490 align:start position:0%
to Medical Care the rest of that 20
percent

01:50:37.490 --> 01:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:50:42.410 --> 01:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
goes to overhead to new buildings goes
 
01:50:44.090 --> 01:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
to profit
 
01:50:47.450 --> 01:50:47.460 align:start position:0%
the reason that such a phenomena is all
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
pair systems lower cost to answer your
 
01:50:51.770 --> 01:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
question from before and thank you for
 
01:50:53.629 --> 01:50:53.639 align:start position:0%
for clarifying what how the insurance
 
01:50:56.090 --> 01:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
companies set these prices is the
 
01:50:58.129 --> 01:50:58.139 align:start position:0%
insurance companies don't really care
 
01:51:00.590 --> 01:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
very much how much they pay to the
 
01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:01.910 align:start position:0%
very much how much they pay to the
hospitals

01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
01:51:04.729 --> 01:51:04.739 align:start position:0%
fact that your premiums are going up is
 
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
because of the response that the
 
01:51:08.990 --> 01:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals are charging more
 
01:51:10.850 --> 01:51:10.860 align:start position:0%
this is what I'm getting at you and I
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
don't think no I get what you're saying
 
01:51:15.729 --> 01:51:15.739 align:start position:0%
so so each year
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
but just just an important an important
 
01:51:21.590 --> 01:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
evidently representative Terry really
 
01:51:23.450 --> 01:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
wants to okay step in here but you
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
understand the point that this is not
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
about me
 
01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:30.060 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman I just observe that it
 
01:51:32.530 --> 01:51:32.540 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like what we're doing is
 
01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
discussing the nuts and bolts of a
 
01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
single-payer system and its merits or
 
01:51:42.109 --> 01:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
demerits which my understanding is that
 
01:51:44.209 --> 01:51:44.219 align:start position:0%
this would be the responsibility of the
 
01:51:45.530 --> 01:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
01:51:48.770 --> 01:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
to do not for this committee to do today
 
01:51:51.590 --> 01:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
and I am particularly fascinated Mr
 
01:51:53.570 --> 01:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
chairman and colleagues but the fact
 
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
that the two states that have been cited
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
these laws have been implemented have
 
01:52:00.590 --> 01:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
been passed and implemented in states
 
01:52:02.930 --> 01:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
where the Democrats aren't were in
 
01:52:05.090 --> 01:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
control in Maryland and the Republicans
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
were in control in of the house in the
 
01:52:09.410 --> 01:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
senate in Pennsylvania so this
 
01:52:12.890 --> 01:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
fascinates me and put pushes me in the
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
direction of really wanting to learn
 
01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
more about this before I decide whether
 
01:52:20.810 --> 01:52:20.820 align:start position:0%
I would be predisposed favorably or
 
01:52:24.830 --> 01:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
unfavorably to such a system on the face
 
01:52:27.169 --> 01:52:27.179 align:start position:0%
of it there are people who are writing
 
01:52:29.050 --> 01:52:29.060 align:start position:0%
to me people who are particularly
 
01:52:31.970 --> 01:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
inclined to be supportive of me who are
 
01:52:34.330 --> 01:52:34.340 align:start position:0%
calling this socialized medicine
 
01:52:39.530 --> 01:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
and uh a a a Canadian model with all of
 
01:52:42.070 --> 01:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
the of the of the disasters stories
 
01:52:44.689 --> 01:52:44.699 align:start position:0%
anecdotal stories and statistics we get
 
01:52:45.709 --> 01:52:45.719 align:start position:0%
out of Canada
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
I think it's premature to call something
 
01:52:51.229 --> 01:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
something that it may not be so I would
 
01:52:51.239 --> 01:52:52.129 align:start position:0%
something that it may not be so I would
be

01:52:52.129 --> 01:52:52.139 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
um I would I would appreciate if we
 
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
could move to decide whether or not we
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
want to even Empower a study committee
 
01:52:59.870 --> 01:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
or we just want to kill this thing right
 
01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:02.109 align:start position:0%
or we just want to kill this thing right
now

01:53:02.109 --> 01:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.290 --> 01:53:05.300 align:start position:0%
representative this is not a a
 
01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
single-payer system there is a bill to
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
that effect all payer includes all
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
private insurers it does not eliminate
 
01:53:16.129 --> 01:53:16.139 align:start position:0%
the private insurers it just lowers
 
01:53:19.490 --> 01:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
costs by making it transparent and the
 
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
negotiating process it takes care of the
 
01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
pricing failures that exist with the 80
 
01:53:28.250 --> 01:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
20 rule from the ACA and the opaque
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
negotiations so thank you thank you Ms
 
01:53:32.930 --> 01:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
highlights once again the fact that
 
01:53:35.330 --> 01:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of Education that needs to
 
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
be done around this so that they're
 
01:53:38.330 --> 01:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
going to be a greater understanding
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
before we come to a decision
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
I thank you thank you so Mr chairman my
 
01:53:46.910 --> 01:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
question to you
 
01:53:49.370 --> 01:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass this
 
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:55.970 --> 01:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
is this punishment then you would be
 
01:53:58.970 --> 01:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
chair of this study do you want to do it
 
01:54:01.189 --> 01:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
you can always become a Dem go ahead no
 
01:54:03.410 --> 01:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
do you want do would you want to do this
 
01:54:05.629 --> 01:54:05.639 align:start position:0%
study committee remember Governor Hogan
 
01:54:07.790 --> 01:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
was the governor of Maryland during all
 
01:54:09.490 --> 01:54:09.500 align:start position:0%
of this time
 
01:54:11.450 --> 01:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
right but in Pennsylvania the
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
legislature only recently
 
01:54:15.649 --> 01:54:15.659 align:start position:0%
than Republican so I don't know it's
 
01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
been Republican for the last uh two or
 
01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
three four terms right but how when did
 
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
it pass in Pennsylvania by Republicans
 
01:54:24.050 --> 01:54:24.060 align:start position:0%
when did it pass when did it passing
 
01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
it's been under invest it was being
 
01:54:27.290 --> 01:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
studied for the past four years yeah no
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
it hasn't passed in Pennsylvania no it
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
did pass and it passed I think uh two
 
01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
years ago well so it's actually right
 
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
now it's law in Pennsylvania years ago
 
01:54:36.649 --> 01:54:36.659 align:start position:0%
the Republicans controlled the house in
 
01:54:37.970 --> 01:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
the Senate they just flipped one house
 
01:54:47.050 --> 01:54:47.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:50.330 --> 01:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for four people who want to
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
do this study this okay so that if you
 
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
guys are all willing to do it then let's
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
no actually this is great for you guys
 
01:55:05.149 --> 01:55:05.159 align:start position:0%
to learn learn what study committees how
 
01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
they work and what happens you're gonna
 
01:55:09.050 --> 01:55:09.060 align:start position:0%
You're Gonna Learn first aid but I want

Mr chairman but that does not
 
01:55:16.250 --> 01:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that I'm everything
 
01:55:18.649 --> 01:55:18.659 align:start position:0%

01:55:33.410 --> 01:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:34.850 --> 01:55:34.860 align:start position:0%
I I
 
01:55:37.490 --> 01:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh okay so the committee recommends
 
01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:38.810 align:start position:0%
uh okay so the committee recommends
Terry

01:55:38.810 --> 01:55:38.820 align:start position:0%
Terry
 
01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
collabro post
 
01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
just great
 
01:55:47.209 --> 01:55:47.219 align:start position:0%
and who's who's my fourth
 
01:55:49.070 --> 01:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
no I got post
 
01:55:52.370 --> 01:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for looking to advance uh
 
01:55:55.070 --> 01:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
who's my four exception yeah I just want
 
01:55:57.590 --> 01:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
you to know what I find insane about
 
01:56:00.530 --> 01:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
this is I've been around too long so we
 
01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
used to have a law called most favored
 
01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:03.830 align:start position:0%
used to have a law called most favored
nation

01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
nation
 
01:56:08.689 --> 01:56:08.699 align:start position:0%
and that is that whatever the uh One
 
01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
Insurance Company agreed to in terms of
 
01:56:14.689 --> 01:56:14.699 align:start position:0%
the contract then all the other ones got
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
to be at the same rate
 
01:56:19.250 --> 01:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
okay and so we got rid of that because
 
01:56:21.590 --> 01:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
we thought we wanted a competitive
 
01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
market that insurance companies could be
 
01:56:27.709 --> 01:56:27.719 align:start position:0%
negotiating with each individual
 
01:56:30.229 --> 01:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
hospitals based upon their Hospital
 
01:56:32.750 --> 01:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
situation what's the best situation for
 
01:56:35.209 --> 01:56:35.219 align:start position:0%
them competing and which ones they could
 
01:56:37.129 --> 01:56:37.139 align:start position:0%
drive more customers to and then they
 
01:56:39.410 --> 01:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
that rate that they would negotiate
 
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
would be based upon how many customers
 
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
how many you know clients they're going
 
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
to be sending to that particular
 
01:56:48.169 --> 01:56:48.179 align:start position:0%
hospital and again you know make it up
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
in volume so if you think if if there if
 
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
you're telling me that hiring a third a
 
01:56:58.490 --> 01:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
state bureaucracy creating a statement
 
01:57:00.590 --> 01:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's actually using your existing
 
01:57:02.209 --> 01:57:02.219 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy I just looked up another
 
01:57:04.729 --> 01:57:04.739 align:start position:0%
website there are 12 different Health
 
01:57:07.370 --> 01:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
Systems the health bureaucracies what
 
01:57:09.609 --> 01:57:09.619 align:start position:0%
are you talking about democracies
 
01:57:12.770 --> 01:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
Department of Health yeah I want to
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for voting on this by the way
 
01:57:15.770 --> 01:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
you and I both remember when there was
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
no such thing as a for-profit health
 
01:57:20.570 --> 01:57:20.580 align:start position:0%
insurance uh other than a person there's
 
01:57:22.250 --> 01:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
Blue Cross we have one in state we
 
01:57:25.250 --> 01:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
remember when there were also such
 
01:57:27.950 --> 01:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
things as high risk risk pools and such
 
01:57:30.350 --> 01:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
things as pre-existing conditions we
 
01:57:33.970 --> 01:57:33.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:36.050 --> 01:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
agreed and thank you for moving who is
 
01:57:37.609 --> 01:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
my fourth
 
01:57:40.189 --> 01:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
you're gonna do it okay
 
01:57:40.199 --> 01:57:41.629 align:start position:0%
you're gonna do it okay
okay

01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
the motion is uh to
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
all those in favor raise their hand
 
01:57:54.290 --> 01:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
okay one two three
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:06.649 --> 01:58:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:10.970 --> 01:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:14.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:58:14.750 --> 01:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:41.209 --> 01:58:41.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:44.030 --> 01:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
all right establishing an interstate
 
01:58:47.450 --> 01:58:47.460 align:start position:0%
compact for Universal Health Care
 
01:58:50.089 --> 01:58:50.099 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
01:58:53.089 --> 01:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
this one runs on the idea if I
 
01:58:55.550 --> 01:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
understand if I remember correctly that
 
01:58:57.669 --> 01:58:57.679 align:start position:0%
if we just had
 
01:59:00.890 --> 01:59:00.900 align:start position:0%
one Insurance product
 
01:59:03.850 --> 01:59:03.860 align:start position:0%
in the New England states
 
01:59:07.790 --> 01:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
then we could drop
 
01:59:12.530 --> 01:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
the premium by 15 is that right
 
01:59:15.950 --> 01:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:18.350 align:start position:0%
 
if

01:59:18.350 --> 01:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:22.729 align:start position:0%
if
nothing

01:59:22.729 --> 01:59:22.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:25.850 --> 01:59:25.860 align:start position:0%
so the idea here is it's fairly simple
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
if we buy Health Care in bulk
 
01:59:30.649 --> 01:59:30.659 align:start position:0%
we'll get a lower price for it
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's where the interstate compact
 
01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
we work with other states so that we
 
01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
have a higher population base that we're
 
01:59:39.770 --> 01:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
covering our neighbor States whoever
 
01:59:41.930 --> 01:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
else in the United States wants to join
 
01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
us and therefore we're able to negotiate
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
prices with the hospitals with the
 
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies all that sort
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
of stuff
 
01:59:52.490 --> 01:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
um and and just sort of centralize
 
01:59:54.109 --> 01:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
everything in one spot
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
um so we get one price for everything
 
01:59:58.250 --> 01:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't know if it would be
 
02:00:00.830 --> 02:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
15 more or less
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
um because it would depend on the exact
 
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
number of states in the compact
 
02:00:06.169 --> 02:00:06.179 align:start position:0%
um the exact numbers
 
02:00:07.790 --> 02:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
um but yes it would cut costs and save
 
02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:09.350 align:start position:0%
um but yes it would cut costs and save
money

02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
02:00:14.450 --> 02:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
yes representative I guess my question
 
02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:16.430 align:start position:0%
yes representative I guess my question
is

02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:00:18.709 --> 02:00:18.719 align:start position:0%
you you don't yet have people who have
 
02:00:20.570 --> 02:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
agreed to be in this compact is that
 
02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:21.890 align:start position:0%
agreed to be in this compact is that
right

02:00:21.890 --> 02:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:00:23.629 --> 02:00:23.639 align:start position:0%
um we have talked to folks in
 
02:00:23.639 --> 02:00:24.950 align:start position:0%
um we have talked to folks in
Massachusetts

02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
02:00:27.050 --> 02:00:27.060 align:start position:0%
um in Maine who are these folks are they
 
02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
decision makers
 
02:00:31.010 --> 02:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
um there is currently a bill in
 
02:00:32.930 --> 02:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that would create a system
 
02:00:35.089 --> 02:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
like this it's just not interstate
 
02:00:37.850 --> 02:00:37.860 align:start position:0%
compact I believe there has been in the
 
02:00:39.950 --> 02:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
past similar things in Maine and Vermont
 
02:00:42.649 --> 02:00:42.659 align:start position:0%
as well and also out west as well but
 
02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
you don't yet have decision makers who
 
02:00:46.010 --> 02:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
have said we want to do this
 
02:00:47.689 --> 02:00:47.699 align:start position:0%
so correct I don't live in other states
 
02:00:50.689 --> 02:00:50.699 align:start position:0%
so I'm not clear how we can
 
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
still be establishing an interstate
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
compact unless we have the players you'd
 
02:00:57.410 --> 02:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
be the first what happens is you pass
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
the bill and the bill sits there
 
02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
um until other states join it it doesn't
 
02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
go into effect until other states have
 
02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:05.270 align:start position:0%
go into effect until other states have
joined

02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
joined
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
there's no no risk involved okay for you
 
02:01:08.159 --> 02:01:09.169 align:start position:0%
there's no no risk involved okay for you
here

02:01:09.169 --> 02:01:09.179 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:01:11.089 --> 02:01:11.099 align:start position:0%
if no one else wants to do it nothing
 
02:01:13.850 --> 02:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
happens right and and yes representative
 
02:01:16.850 --> 02:01:16.860 align:start position:0%
so hypothetically let's say that Vermont
 
02:01:19.330 --> 02:01:19.340 align:start position:0%
and Maine and Massachusetts
 
02:01:22.490 --> 02:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire were to form in such
 
02:01:26.510 --> 02:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
an interstate compact uh what would be
 
02:01:29.030 --> 02:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
the decision-making process
 
02:01:31.669 --> 02:01:31.679 align:start position:0%
who who would be the players and what
 
02:01:33.709 --> 02:01:33.719 align:start position:0%
Authority would they have what vote
 
02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
would they have I'm concerned here that
 
02:01:36.599 --> 02:01:38.330 align:start position:0%
would they have I'm concerned here that
by

02:01:38.330 --> 02:01:38.340 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:01:40.609 --> 02:01:40.619 align:start position:0%
um becoming a party to an interstate
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
compact but not necessarily agreeing
 
02:01:46.729 --> 02:01:46.739 align:start position:0%
with the other players that one would
 
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
have to go along with the majority
 
02:01:51.950 --> 02:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
whatever the majority decides and we
 
02:01:53.870 --> 02:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
already know that there are significant
 
02:01:56.810 --> 02:01:56.820 align:start position:0%
differences represented by these four
 
02:01:59.450 --> 02:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
states for example
 
02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
what how do you respond to that
 
02:02:04.609 --> 02:02:04.619 align:start position:0%
I mean at the end of the day
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
um regardless of which side of the aisle
 
02:02:10.490 --> 02:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
you're on you need health care
 
02:02:12.589 --> 02:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
um the needs between you know you and
 
02:02:14.450 --> 02:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
any other members of
 
02:02:17.089 --> 02:02:17.099 align:start position:0%
this committee here are fairly similar
 
02:02:19.250 --> 02:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
regardless of of what letter is next to
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
your name you all need to see a doctor
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
um what the interstate comeback does is
 
02:02:26.270 --> 02:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
it would establish a board to determine
 
02:02:28.070 --> 02:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
those sorts of things
 
02:02:30.050 --> 02:02:30.060 align:start position:0%
um at the end of the day they're just
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that that you're able to see
 
02:02:34.250 --> 02:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
the doctors you need to see to get the
 
02:02:37.070 --> 02:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
care you need to get you are able to get
 
02:02:40.250 --> 02:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
the drugs you need this is not
 
02:02:42.589 --> 02:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
rocket science here it shouldn't be
 
02:02:42.599 --> 02:02:44.209 align:start position:0%
rocket science here it shouldn't be
controversial

02:02:44.209 --> 02:02:44.219 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
02:02:46.609 --> 02:02:46.619 align:start position:0%
um the intent here is to to get us back
 
02:02:48.649 --> 02:02:48.659 align:start position:0%
to sort of the pragmatic let's just get
 
02:02:51.410 --> 02:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:53.209 --> 02:02:53.219 align:start position:0%
representative spear
 
02:02:55.490 --> 02:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
uh realizing that I'm not allowed to
 
02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:56.570 align:start position:0%
uh realizing that I'm not allowed to
vote

02:02:56.570 --> 02:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:02:58.850 --> 02:02:58.860 align:start position:0%
that's true but you can but I can say
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
something you can say something
 
02:03:03.229 --> 02:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
so there's there's really excuse me
 
02:03:05.810 --> 02:03:05.820 align:start position:0%
there's really two issues
 
02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:07.310 align:start position:0%
there's really two issues
with

02:03:07.310 --> 02:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:03:10.129 --> 02:03:10.139 align:start position:0%
uh the funding of this
 
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
one issue is
 
02:03:15.410 --> 02:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
what representative Terry talks about in
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that if we don't get enough of
 
02:03:20.570 --> 02:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
a a base we're not going to be able to
 
02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
do anything anyway right and that's what
 
02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
you've said the other funding issue is
 
02:03:27.709 --> 02:03:27.719 align:start position:0%
the Assumption which we have talked
 
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
about that you are not going to get
 
02:03:31.850 --> 02:03:31.860 align:start position:0%
people from Medicare and you're not
 
02:03:33.890 --> 02:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
going to get self
 
02:03:37.689 --> 02:03:37.699 align:start position:0%
-insured people like BAE Systems CNS
 
02:03:39.609 --> 02:03:39.619 align:start position:0%
CNS grocery
 
02:03:42.530 --> 02:03:42.540 align:start position:0%
Fidelity all the self-insurers wouldn't
 
02:03:44.930 --> 02:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
even be allowed to touch this so what
 
02:03:46.250 --> 02:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
does that leave us
 
02:03:49.189 --> 02:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
that leaves us a fairly small bucket of
 
02:03:51.729 --> 02:03:51.739 align:start position:0%
people in this state
 
02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
influenced by people from out of the
 
02:03:54.719 --> 02:03:57.229 align:start position:0%
influenced by people from out of the
state

02:03:57.229 --> 02:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:59.149 --> 02:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
this this thing either needs to be
 
02:03:59.159 --> 02:04:00.709 align:start position:0%
this this thing either needs to be
reworked

02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
reworked
 
02:04:03.950 --> 02:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
or it's just not not tenable and I'm not
 
02:04:05.149 --> 02:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
going to say anything else because I
 
02:04:09.770 --> 02:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:12.770 --> 02:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
may I respond to that um
 
02:04:15.890 --> 02:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
it's not a given that the
 
02:04:18.890 --> 02:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
waiver from the federal government or
 
02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
Medicare funds to be pulled into
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
distrust fund it most certainly is I
 
02:04:28.850 --> 02:04:28.860 align:start position:0%
have looked at this in detail it cannot
 
02:04:31.310 --> 02:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
be done unless we get together with
 
02:04:33.169 --> 02:04:33.179 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the states of this country
 
02:04:36.709 --> 02:04:36.719 align:start position:0%
which we had no chance of doing well we
 
02:04:40.129 --> 02:04:40.139 align:start position:0%
have information that you don't need an
 
02:04:43.149 --> 02:04:43.159 align:start position:0%
act of Congress you can
 
02:04:46.970 --> 02:04:46.980 align:start position:0%
as well as administrative orders by the
 
02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:48.169 align:start position:0%
as well as administrative orders by the
president

02:04:48.169 --> 02:04:48.179 align:start position:0%
president
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
can because uh raw Canada from
 
02:04:55.330 --> 02:04:55.340 align:start position:0%
California has a bill which calls for
 
02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
different from the ACA waiver process a
 
02:05:02.209 --> 02:05:02.219 align:start position:0%
waiver pathway there I'm sorry there are
 
02:05:04.790 --> 02:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
lots of bills floating around just like
 
02:05:05.930 --> 02:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
this one
 
02:05:07.970 --> 02:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
pleading with Medicare to do this
 
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
pleading with Medicaid to do that they
 
02:05:13.129 --> 02:05:13.139 align:start position:0%
don't accept the bills show me a bill
 
02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
that has actually passed and they've
 
02:05:17.089 --> 02:05:17.099 align:start position:0%
gotten money out of Medicare now
 
02:05:19.850 --> 02:05:19.860 align:start position:0%
remember Medicare isn't paid by taxes
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's paid out of a fund directly from
 
02:05:25.370 --> 02:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
the treasury they people don't have
 
02:05:27.950 --> 02:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
access to that money
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative spear as I explained to
 
02:05:32.149 --> 02:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
you um over email I believe we don't
 
02:05:34.970 --> 02:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
need a Medicare waiver
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
um what would happen is folks on
 
02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
traditional Medicare like you yourself
 
02:05:39.649 --> 02:05:39.659 align:start position:0%
as you told me
 
02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
um would receive a supplemental plan
 
02:05:43.550 --> 02:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
from the interstate compact because we
 
02:05:44.689 --> 02:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
can't necessarily touch that money
 
02:05:44.699 --> 02:05:46.010 align:start position:0%
can't necessarily touch that money
without

02:05:46.010 --> 02:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:05:47.689 --> 02:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
um Congress changing something which may
 
02:05:49.490 --> 02:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
or may not happen of course
 
02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:50.270 align:start position:0%
or may not happen of course
um

02:05:50.270 --> 02:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:52.070 --> 02:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
we just give you a supplemental plan to
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
cover the stuff that Medicare doesn't
 
02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:54.350 align:start position:0%
cover the stuff that Medicare doesn't
cover

02:05:54.350 --> 02:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
cover
 
02:05:56.030 --> 02:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
um and that way we don't need the
 
02:05:57.050 --> 02:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
federal government money because they
 
02:05:58.250 --> 02:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
just keep paying for it as they would
 
02:05:58.260 --> 02:05:59.510 align:start position:0%
just keep paying for it as they would
normally

02:05:59.510 --> 02:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
normally
 
02:06:01.129 --> 02:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
um and the interstate compact would
 
02:06:03.890 --> 02:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
handle the rest then in that case where
 
02:06:05.270 --> 02:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
are you going to get the funding the
 
02:06:07.010 --> 02:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
other people that can't that you cannot
 
02:06:08.689 --> 02:06:08.699 align:start position:0%
touch are the people that are
 
02:06:10.729 --> 02:06:10.739 align:start position:0%
self-funded the insurance companies that
 
02:06:12.530 --> 02:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
are self-funded they are governed at the
 
02:06:14.209 --> 02:06:14.219 align:start position:0%
federal level so that's what does that
 
02:06:17.209 --> 02:06:17.219 align:start position:0%
lead correct as is funded
 
02:06:19.010 --> 02:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
as I explained to you
 
02:06:22.850 --> 02:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
um under erisa um companies that operate
 
02:06:25.550 --> 02:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
in multiple states are required to offer
 
02:06:27.169 --> 02:06:27.179 align:start position:0%
um Insurance the same insurance plan to
 
02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
all of their employees that doesn't mean
 
02:06:30.530 --> 02:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
that those employees have to use that
 
02:06:31.790 --> 02:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
insurance plan
 
02:06:32.930 --> 02:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
um and if they don't use it the company
 
02:06:34.430 --> 02:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to pay for it all right
 
02:06:36.109 --> 02:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
I've been under personally I've been
 
02:06:38.030 --> 02:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
under that kind of insurance plan all of
 
02:06:41.750 --> 02:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
my life all of my working life not once
 
02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
not ever and that's older than you
 
02:06:48.649 --> 02:06:48.659 align:start position:0%
no one not ever so anybody been allowed
 
02:06:51.649 --> 02:06:51.659 align:start position:0%
to opt out of those plans
 
02:06:54.770 --> 02:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
the way that this would work is
 
02:06:54.780 --> 02:06:55.370 align:start position:0%
the way that this would work is
um

02:06:55.370 --> 02:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:56.689 --> 02:06:56.699 align:start position:0%
companies aren't going to want to pay
 
02:06:58.550 --> 02:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
for the same thing twice they have two
 
02:07:00.890 --> 02:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
options they can and keep encouraging
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
people to pay it for their use the erisa
 
02:07:05.689 --> 02:07:05.699 align:start position:0%
plans or they can encourage them to go
 
02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
on the interstate compact plan which
 
02:07:08.810 --> 02:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
would cost them less
 
02:07:11.089 --> 02:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
and so because that's a better option
 
02:07:14.750 --> 02:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
for them but they can't use it
 
02:07:16.970 --> 02:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
if you are governed underneath if you
 
02:07:20.330 --> 02:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
are a self-insured company selfish wood
 
02:07:22.729 --> 02:07:22.739 align:start position:0%
like BAE Systems you must offer the
 
02:07:25.250 --> 02:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
exact same plan to everybody in the
 
02:07:26.930 --> 02:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
company from the president down to the
 
02:07:28.669 --> 02:07:28.679 align:start position:0%
guy who cleans the garbage I wish they'd
 
02:07:38.589 --> 02:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:43.490 --> 02:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
opt out that is not legal no one's no so
 
02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
I I don't see how anybody in New
 
02:07:46.970 --> 02:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can take advantage of it when
 
02:07:49.310 --> 02:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to touch it I'm
 
02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:50.750 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to touch it I'm
sorry

02:07:50.750 --> 02:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:07:53.390 --> 02:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Burroughs the
 
02:07:58.330 --> 02:07:58.340 align:start position:0%
second hit from representative uh hunt
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
moves uh inexpedient to legislate
 
02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:04.910 align:start position:0%
moves uh inexpedient to legislate
yeah

02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:08:07.970 --> 02:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the motion of inexpion
 
02:08:13.370 --> 02:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:15.530 --> 02:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
I just think that this bill is not ready
 
02:08:17.450 --> 02:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
I just want it on record that I applaud
 
02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
what you're doing you know I I think
 
02:08:21.470 --> 02:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
there's you know benefit in looking at
 
02:08:23.209 --> 02:08:23.219 align:start position:0%
this but I don't think this is ready to
 
02:08:23.219 --> 02:08:26.089 align:start position:0%
this but I don't think this is ready to
roll

02:08:26.089 --> 02:08:26.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:26.099 --> 02:08:28.970 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:08:28.970 --> 02:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:30.890 --> 02:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
um all those in favor of uh inexp mean
 
02:08:33.010 --> 02:08:33.020 align:start position:0%
to legislate raise your hand
 
02:08:38.149 --> 02:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:48.890 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:08:48.890 --> 02:08:48.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:50.750 --> 02:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
I did
 
02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:53.870 align:start position:0%
I did
okay

02:08:53.870 --> 02:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
but

02:08:54.950 --> 02:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:09:01.970 --> 02:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:01.980 --> 02:09:03.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:09:03.890 --> 02:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:09:07.010 --> 02:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:09.109 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
02:09:15.010 --> 02:09:15.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:18.410 --> 02:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
uh related to billing for ambulance
 
02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:19.729 align:start position:0%
uh related to billing for ambulance
services

02:09:19.729 --> 02:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:09:21.890 --> 02:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
do you want to just retain this yeah I
 
02:09:23.930 --> 02:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
would like to retain um the ambulance
 
02:09:25.430 --> 02:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
service bill
 
02:09:28.370 --> 02:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
um the more I thought about it and and
 
02:09:31.390 --> 02:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
um talk to people involved I'm actually
 
02:09:33.470 --> 02:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
looking into
 
02:09:36.410 --> 02:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
um idea of finding federal or uh grants
 
02:09:38.689 --> 02:09:38.699 align:start position:0%
from from for Rural
 
02:09:40.970 --> 02:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
um that we might get for Rural ambulance
 
02:09:43.550 --> 02:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
services so I'd like to explore that as
 
02:09:45.770 --> 02:09:45.780 align:start position:0%
a possible alternative to legislation so
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
therefore I'd like to retain it
 
02:09:51.770 --> 02:09:51.780 align:start position:0%
okay so if if I understand Mr chairman
 
02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
so you're exploring non-legislative
 
02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:56.510 align:start position:0%
so you're exploring non-legislative
alternatives

02:09:56.510 --> 02:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
alternatives
 
02:09:59.209 --> 02:09:59.219 align:start position:0%
so that legislation would not be
 
02:10:01.850 --> 02:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
necessary but you want to retain the
 
02:10:04.430 --> 02:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
legislation anyway
 
02:10:07.970 --> 02:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not 100 sure I'm saying I'm not 100
 
02:10:10.430 --> 02:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
sure at this point whether we can find
 
02:10:12.530 --> 02:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
money but I would like to do so
 
02:10:15.290 --> 02:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
and use the legislation as a fallback oh
 
02:10:17.270 --> 02:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
so you essentially want to put this on a
 
02:10:19.070 --> 02:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
hold or put it in the freezer in case
 
02:10:21.470 --> 02:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
you want to bring a deep Breeze well how
 
02:10:22.970 --> 02:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
would you like to do it you want to itl
 
02:10:25.310 --> 02:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
no I'm just asking a question I just
 
02:10:27.470 --> 02:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
want to understand this is not this will
 
02:10:29.149 --> 02:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
no longer be your primary vehicle
 
02:10:30.830 --> 02:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
because you're going to be exploring
 
02:10:32.510 --> 02:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
other Alternatives that you think more
 
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
may be more favorable but I'm saying I
 
02:10:36.290 --> 02:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
don't know at this point to your
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
objective uh representative if if she
 
02:10:43.010 --> 02:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
were to find another source right
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
then we would need to revisit the
 
02:10:48.589 --> 02:10:48.599 align:start position:0%
legislation the statute to correct the
 
02:10:51.229 --> 02:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
stat the statute that would reflect that
 
02:10:54.350 --> 02:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue because in this bill was the
 
02:10:58.010 --> 02:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
Banning of balance billing so if she was
 
02:11:00.109 --> 02:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
to find other sources so they would take
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
care of those ambulance services that
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
that are need to do the balanced billing
 
02:11:07.850 --> 02:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
that if that they have now been
 
02:11:09.890 --> 02:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
satisfied by another source then we
 
02:11:11.450 --> 02:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
could go forward with passing the bill
 
02:11:13.370 --> 02:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
with the ban on balance billing
 
02:11:15.290 --> 02:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
understood that's why she wanted to
 
02:11:17.629 --> 02:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
retain it considered Prudence by
 
02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
representative Earls thank you okay
 
02:11:22.790 --> 02:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:25.790 --> 02:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
okay she's back Mr chairman yes
 
02:11:27.410 --> 02:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
02:11:29.689 --> 02:11:29.699 align:start position:0%
um there was also uh another element of
 
02:11:31.070 --> 02:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
um which uh is something that I think um
 
02:11:35.870 --> 02:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
we would want to discuss on retaining it
 
02:11:38.330 --> 02:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
and that was the requirement that the
 
02:11:41.149 --> 02:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
insurance companies pay the ambulance
 
02:11:44.209 --> 02:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
services directly rather than paying the
 
02:11:46.010 --> 02:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
patient and then
 
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
um having it be the patient who then has
 
02:11:49.729 --> 02:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
to pass the money onto the ambulance
 
02:11:51.709 --> 02:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
service which sometimes happens and
 
02:11:53.390 --> 02:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes does not happen which
 
02:11:55.490 --> 02:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
obviously caused a lot of problems for
 
02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
the ambulance services that didn't get
 
02:11:59.450 --> 02:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
paid so I think that's something that we
 
02:12:01.070 --> 02:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
would also want to discuss
 
02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
um that makes it worthwhile retaining
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
the bill there you go
 
02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:10.310 align:start position:0%
the bill there you go
okay

02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:13.189 --> 02:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
all right so the motion is to retain all
 
02:12:15.530 --> 02:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
those any discussion on the motion
 
02:12:17.930 --> 02:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
teen none all those in favor raise your
 
02:12:17.940 --> 02:12:18.830 align:start position:0%
teen none all those in favor raise your
hand

02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
hand
 
02:12:21.229 --> 02:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
one two three
 
02:12:21.239 --> 02:12:22.490 align:start position:0%
one two three
four

02:12:22.490 --> 02:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
four
 
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:37.550 --> 02:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
all right relative provider contract
 
02:12:43.450 --> 02:12:43.460 align:start position:0%
standards for pharmacy benefit managers
 
02:12:46.609 --> 02:12:46.619 align:start position:0%
so we want to retain this is that right
 
02:12:49.069 --> 02:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to retain this
 
02:12:50.810 --> 02:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
02:12:53.569 --> 02:12:53.579 align:start position:0%
so representative hunt
 
02:12:57.050 --> 02:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Burroughs
 
02:12:57.060 --> 02:12:58.729 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Burroughs

okay
 
02:13:16.010 --> 02:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
all right representative Terry
 
02:13:19.010 --> 02:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh moves to retain no you do when I
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
second you yes you're seconding you're
 
02:13:29.330 --> 02:13:29.340 align:start position:0%

okay

02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:34.079 --> 02:13:39.770 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:13:39.770 --> 02:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%

02:13:58.970 --> 02:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:00.890 --> 02:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
getting there how are we doing for time
 
02:14:03.830 --> 02:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay relative to Consumer Protection to
 
02:14:11.270 --> 02:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:12.950 --> 02:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
I really liked this bill for whatever
 
02:14:14.089 --> 02:14:14.099 align:start position:0%
it's worth even though I'm not on the
 
02:14:16.970 --> 02:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
committee you really like this bill oh
 
02:14:18.589 --> 02:14:18.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I like I like what they're
 
02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
trying to get at I was impressed by the
 
02:14:23.870 --> 02:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
gentleman from Colorado who explained it
 
02:14:25.970 --> 02:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
how I was working there and it led to a
 
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
lot of outcomes I think it's a I think
 
02:14:29.689 --> 02:14:29.699 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea and I don't think it
 
02:14:29.699 --> 02:14:31.010 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea and I don't think it
runs

02:14:31.010 --> 02:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
runs
 
02:14:32.990 --> 02:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
um I I think you I think you had concern
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
at the time that it was a little
 
02:14:35.930 --> 02:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
redundant to what the states like but
 
02:14:38.450 --> 02:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
because we just learned that there's
 
02:14:41.089 --> 02:14:41.099 align:start position:0%
this cms.gov Health Plan price
 
02:14:44.450 --> 02:14:44.460 align:start position:0%
transparency resource so I'm assuming
 
02:14:46.910 --> 02:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
what we just learned is what they were
 
02:14:49.069 --> 02:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
trying to get at that that those numbers
 
02:14:50.510 --> 02:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
are being posted
 
02:14:53.149 --> 02:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
it might am I am I assuming correctly
 
02:14:56.149 --> 02:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
exactly but I think it doesn't provide
 
02:14:57.950 --> 02:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
like another spot where they like you
 
02:14:59.209 --> 02:14:59.219 align:start position:0%
can go into their website and find out
 
02:15:00.649 --> 02:15:00.659 align:start position:0%
this so it's like another place for this
 
02:15:02.149 --> 02:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
information to be available versus
 
02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
assuming everybody knows about this
 
02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:04.430 align:start position:0%
assuming everybody knows about this
right

02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman I I don't I don't have a
 
02:15:08.330 --> 02:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
problem with that the problem I have
 
02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
with the was the penalty
 
02:15:14.510 --> 02:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
is that not paying yeah that that's the
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
problem I have
 
02:15:19.250 --> 02:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
so yes representative Mr chairman as I
 
02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:20.530 align:start position:0%
so yes representative Mr chairman as I
recall

02:15:20.530 --> 02:15:20.540 align:start position:0%
recall
 
02:15:20.540 --> 02:15:22.370 align:start position:0%
recall
uh

02:15:22.370 --> 02:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
I I too was impressed with the testimony
 
02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
of the representative from Colorado who
 
02:15:31.669 --> 02:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
informed us that it passed the Colorado
 
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
house I believe 99 to 1. however the
 
02:15:38.270 --> 02:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
presentation that was made by the the
 
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor Prime sponsor and the supporting
 
02:15:44.290 --> 02:15:44.300 align:start position:0%
sponsor left me with a lot of questions
 
02:15:48.050 --> 02:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
with respect to how this would work and
 
02:15:51.169 --> 02:15:51.179 align:start position:0%
be implemented in New Hampshire which
 
02:15:55.370 --> 02:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
still whereas this sounds like I would
 
02:15:57.950 --> 02:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
have voted for it in Colorado I I'm not
 
02:16:00.050 --> 02:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
nearly as ready to vote for it here in
 
02:16:03.050 --> 02:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because the responses and
 
02:16:04.850 --> 02:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
the information that I received from the
 
02:16:07.189 --> 02:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor and the co-sponsor left me with
 
02:16:08.510 --> 02:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions I don't think it's
 
02:16:10.970 --> 02:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
ready for New Hampshire
 
02:16:14.149 --> 02:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
okay representative spear
 
02:16:17.810 --> 02:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
if I remember correctly the bill 389
 
02:16:19.850 --> 02:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
talked about having
 
02:16:23.089 --> 02:16:23.099 align:start position:0%
almost daily updates to the website
 
02:16:25.970 --> 02:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
that's a website to keep and the
 
02:16:28.970 --> 02:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
accuracy had to be very close
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
based on what we heard from the
 
02:16:32.450 --> 02:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
insurance company uh the insurance
 
02:16:34.370 --> 02:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
department rather
 
02:16:36.290 --> 02:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
they're working like crazy and they're
 
02:16:38.929 --> 02:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
trying to get it updated once a quarter
 
02:16:41.570 --> 02:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
so I don't know is it physically
 
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
possible to even do what this bill wants
 
02:16:44.690 --> 02:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:16:47.389 --> 02:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
right well and then and then the issue
 
02:16:49.669 --> 02:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
yeah the issue is what what database
 
02:16:51.290 --> 02:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
they are looking at I mean I assume it's
 
02:16:52.429 --> 02:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
supposed to be maintained by the
 
02:16:54.349 --> 02:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
hospital is the hospital supposed to be
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:00.169 --> 02:17:00.179 align:start position:0%
well I mean I think they were going to
 
02:17:02.150 --> 02:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
be posting all that information on their
 
02:17:04.429 --> 02:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
respective hospital websites so that
 
02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
when somebody's looking to get a knee
 
02:17:07.490 --> 02:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
surgery done they could go to each
 
02:17:09.770 --> 02:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
website of right of the local hospitals
 
02:17:11.810 --> 02:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
and they compare I think the part that
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
sound interesting to me was yeah I mean
 
02:17:15.709 --> 02:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
well what the gentleman from Colorado
 
02:17:18.169 --> 02:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
said with respect to your concern was
 
02:17:20.270 --> 02:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
that I think he said that nobody had
 
02:17:21.889 --> 02:17:21.899 align:start position:0%
ever gotten to a point where they had to
 
02:17:23.990 --> 02:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
take someone to court and I was also
 
02:17:25.250 --> 02:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
concerned with that too and I raised
 
02:17:27.049 --> 02:17:27.059 align:start position:0%
that question that that they usually
 
02:17:28.730 --> 02:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
gave him a reef they would give them
 
02:17:30.770 --> 02:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
enough so it was a negotiating point
 
02:17:32.330 --> 02:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
that you've got to give me a discount
 
02:17:33.889 --> 02:17:33.899 align:start position:0%
because you screwed up and he said
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
nobody nobody had got to that point
 
02:17:37.969 --> 02:17:37.979 align:start position:0%
because they figured it out in advance
 
02:17:40.190 --> 02:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
how to negotiate it versus going to
 
02:17:42.889 --> 02:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
court because it would going to court is
 
02:17:44.570 --> 02:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
that's that's expensive on the person
 
02:17:46.429 --> 02:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
bringing them to court too so I feel
 
02:17:47.810 --> 02:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
like there was an incentive on both
 
02:17:49.849 --> 02:17:49.859 align:start position:0%
parties to negotiate
 
02:17:51.469 --> 02:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
um what I thought was super interesting
 
02:17:51.479 --> 02:17:52.790 align:start position:0%
um what I thought was super interesting
and

02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:54.950 --> 02:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
I know it's not directly the intent of
 
02:17:58.009 --> 02:17:58.019 align:start position:0%
this build but maybe uh an unintended
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
positive consequence of the bill was the
 
02:18:02.389 --> 02:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
idea that there were these apps and tech
 
02:18:05.209 --> 02:18:05.219 align:start position:0%
companies that were popping up to have
 
02:18:06.969 --> 02:18:06.979 align:start position:0%
this information tied to your location
 
02:18:09.469 --> 02:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
you could quickly scan it and he said
 
02:18:12.049 --> 02:18:12.059 align:start position:0%
that that had been popping up in in
 
02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
Colorado and perhaps a similar ecosystem
 
02:18:17.570 --> 02:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
could pop up here which would no offense
 
02:18:20.209 --> 02:18:20.219 align:start position:0%
and with all respect to the insurance or
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
the what the presentation we had today
 
02:18:23.870 --> 02:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
would probably be
 
02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:24.469 align:start position:0%
would probably be
um

02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:26.629 --> 02:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
you know Superior to what the government
 
02:18:28.849 --> 02:18:28.859 align:start position:0%
is producing for us now well I can tell
 
02:18:30.290 --> 02:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
you there won't be because the one thing
 
02:18:32.389 --> 02:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
you can't do is tell you what the doctor
 
02:18:34.849 --> 02:18:34.859 align:start position:0%
or the anesthesiologist or anybody else
 
02:18:37.610 --> 02:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
who's also Billy
 
02:18:39.230 --> 02:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
because you get separate bill those are
 
02:18:41.089 --> 02:18:41.099 align:start position:0%
separate bills
 
02:18:43.250 --> 02:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
that's true I mean I'm just saying that
 
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
was the big project we had for for the
 
02:18:48.589 --> 02:18:48.599 align:start position:0%
Department was we want we want the net
 
02:18:50.530 --> 02:18:50.540 align:start position:0%
we want the net we don't want the gross
 
02:18:54.009 --> 02:18:54.019 align:start position:0%
we want with everybody all the different
 
02:18:56.650 --> 02:18:56.660 align:start position:0%
providers who were who were in the room
 
02:18:58.849 --> 02:18:58.859 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I thought it was I thought I
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
still thought it was an interesting
 
02:19:01.490 --> 02:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
thing to have like I go on my phone and
 
02:19:03.049 --> 02:19:03.059 align:start position:0%
I'm like I'm in Concord and what are the
 
02:19:05.570 --> 02:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
three hospitals nearby I need to go get
 
02:19:07.370 --> 02:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
my leg x-rayed after I fell off my bike
 
02:19:08.990 --> 02:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
or something and you could like
 
02:19:11.209 --> 02:19:11.219 align:start position:0%
you know I mean that's that that's
 
02:19:13.250 --> 02:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
emergency room yeah yeah and that in
 
02:19:14.629 --> 02:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
that example sure but I mean I think
 
02:19:16.969 --> 02:19:16.979 align:start position:0%
that that's kind of a an interesting
 
02:19:18.530 --> 02:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
outcome that he says is starting to pop
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%
up in Colorado and I I don't know it
 
02:19:23.929 --> 02:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
seems I didn't see a huge downside to
 
02:19:27.049 --> 02:19:27.059 align:start position:0%
this aside from what downside to me is
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
the threat that they won't pay the bill
 
02:19:29.870 --> 02:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
at all
 
02:19:31.370 --> 02:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
and the last thing I want to do is
 
02:19:33.889 --> 02:19:33.899 align:start position:0%
create a situation where that right or
 
02:19:36.049 --> 02:19:36.059 align:start position:0%
some technicality it's almost you know
 
02:19:38.690 --> 02:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
which I agreed with and I I asked that
 
02:19:41.690 --> 02:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
question of them and but I was I was
 
02:19:43.669 --> 02:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
impressed by the gentleman's answer from
 
02:19:45.169 --> 02:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
Colorado which is it hasn't happened
 
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
there because hey there's a cost to take
 
02:19:50.090 --> 02:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
somebody to court right and B once you
 
02:19:51.349 --> 02:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
get to that point if you know you're out
 
02:19:52.610 --> 02:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
of compliance you have an incentive to
 
02:19:55.010 --> 02:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
negotiate with them versus going to
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
court and getting you know so I don't
 
02:19:58.910 --> 02:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
know I mean I thought that was a good
 
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
explanation from the gentleman Colorado
 
02:20:02.870 --> 02:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay that's all I take I'm not like
 
02:20:04.310 --> 02:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
sorry to this but I was impressed by
 
02:20:05.870 --> 02:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
everything will the hospital Association
 
02:20:12.310 --> 02:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
02:20:22.849 --> 02:20:22.859 align:start position:0%
the committee I unfortunately was in
 
02:20:24.830 --> 02:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
another hearing so I did not hear the
 
02:20:26.450 --> 02:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
Department's presentation on health
 
02:20:29.330 --> 02:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
costs so I when you were sightings
 
02:20:31.790 --> 02:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
um chairman hunt the CMS website I'm
 
02:20:33.830 --> 02:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
assuming that's the CMS website relative
 
02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:35.450 align:start position:0%
assuming that's the CMS website relative
to

02:20:35.450 --> 02:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:20:37.849 --> 02:20:37.859 align:start position:0%
um the no surprises Act help plan price
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
transparency resource 500 items it's all
 
02:20:43.849 --> 02:20:43.859 align:start position:0%
it's all part of the no surprises act no
 
02:20:48.050 --> 02:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
surprise the um but that is probably
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
um and not to
 
02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
um not to um throw my um carrier friends
 
02:20:55.010 --> 02:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
under the bus but that might be for the
 
02:20:58.190 --> 02:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
carriers the hospitals have to post as I
 
02:21:01.010 --> 02:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
my testimony indicated that no surprises
 
02:21:05.090 --> 02:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
Act is was is phased in and so I think
 
02:21:07.490 --> 02:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
that might be relative to the carriers
 
02:21:09.590 --> 02:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
right okay that could be wrong the
 
02:21:11.570 --> 02:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
hospitals we had to do this starting in
 
02:21:14.210 --> 02:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
21 and they have been posting which act
 
02:21:16.130 --> 02:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
was that that required you the same act
 
02:21:18.170 --> 02:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
as just it was phased in because it's so
 
02:21:18.180 --> 02:21:19.370 align:start position:0%
as just it was phased in because it's so
complex

02:21:19.370 --> 02:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
complex
 
02:21:21.950 --> 02:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
um and that is where they have to they
 
02:21:24.290 --> 02:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
have to um as my testimony indicated
 
02:21:26.570 --> 02:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
that they are required to make available
 
02:21:29.150 --> 02:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
on their websites single machine
 
02:21:31.849 --> 02:21:31.859 align:start position:0%
readable digital file containing
 
02:21:35.450 --> 02:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
standard charges up to 300 of their
 
02:21:38.510 --> 02:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
common services so that's that was put
 
02:21:41.690 --> 02:21:41.700 align:start position:0%
into effect a couple years ago and I
 
02:21:44.510 --> 02:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
just think it's important to um to
 
02:21:46.849 --> 02:21:46.859 align:start position:0%
comment everything in this bill is
 
02:21:49.550 --> 02:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
already in in federal law
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
um so the the difference is so
 
02:21:55.309 --> 02:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
the difference is has to do with the
 
02:21:57.650 --> 02:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
collection piece which is what I think a
 
02:21:59.389 --> 02:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
lot of people have concerns about what
 
02:22:01.969 --> 02:22:01.979 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences are that is
 
02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
right and that is certainly something
 
02:22:06.530 --> 02:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
that we um we're opposed to this entire
 
02:22:08.270 --> 02:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
bill but that is another unintended
 
02:22:10.309 --> 02:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
consequence another thing that I think
 
02:22:13.130 --> 02:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
is important is websites are developed
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
now you don't need this law to in the
 
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to to have
 
02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:21.050 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to to have
entrepreneurs

02:22:21.050 --> 02:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs
 
02:22:22.510 --> 02:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
um develop
 
02:22:25.370 --> 02:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
databases based on the no surprises act
 
02:22:28.429 --> 02:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
based on the chis database we had that
 
02:22:30.349 --> 02:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
now I'm trying to remember the
 
02:22:33.050 --> 02:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
individual um I'm looking at my
 
02:22:34.969 --> 02:22:34.979 align:start position:0%
colleagues back there um there might be
 
02:22:40.130 --> 02:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
someone that was developing is it the I
 
02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
forget the name but he has a company
 
02:22:46.130 --> 02:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
um that it was actually remember he came
 
02:22:49.550 --> 02:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
he was dressed as an owl oh I remember
 
02:22:51.889 --> 02:22:51.899 align:start position:0%
that guy yeah yeah yeah that was good
 
02:22:56.889 --> 02:22:56.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:00.469 --> 02:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
yeah it was a while ago oh thank you uh
 
02:23:03.469 --> 02:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
Mark Galvin um has a company yeah no
 
02:23:06.410 --> 02:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
that was thanks thanks to Heidi she she
 
02:23:08.570 --> 02:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
remembered his name mark Galvin has a
 
02:23:11.450 --> 02:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
company that is doing just this and I
 
02:23:14.450 --> 02:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
believe he is using some of the data now
 
02:23:16.190 --> 02:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
available through the no surprises act
 
02:23:19.070 --> 02:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
to develop his website even more and I
 
02:23:21.410 --> 02:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
am forgetting what the company name is
 
02:23:28.750 --> 02:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:31.309 --> 02:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
owls yes it was
 
02:23:32.510 --> 02:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
um anyway
 
02:23:34.130 --> 02:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted to make those points
 
02:23:36.469 --> 02:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
you don't need this law to develop
 
02:23:39.530 --> 02:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
websites and you and the piece that is
 
02:23:42.230 --> 02:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
different in this bill has to do with
 
02:23:45.050 --> 02:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
the collection piece which I believe has
 
02:23:47.210 --> 02:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
a lot of unintended consequences and
 
02:23:49.370 --> 02:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
furthermore we don't have an issue in
 
02:23:51.410 --> 02:23:51.420 align:start position:0%
this state so why would we um we don't
 
02:23:51.420 --> 02:23:52.190 align:start position:0%
this state so why would we um we don't
support

02:23:52.190 --> 02:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
um passing a law in New Hampshire right
 
02:23:55.849 --> 02:23:55.859 align:start position:0%
when it's not needed
 
02:23:57.770 --> 02:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
seems to me I remember
 
02:23:59.510 --> 02:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
she said that last thing she said that
 
02:24:02.510 --> 02:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
before and I asked which was one is the
 
02:24:04.429 --> 02:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
the sponsors think there is a problem I
 
02:24:07.130 --> 02:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
mean a half this half the hospitals are
 
02:24:09.410 --> 02:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
not in full compliance with the law and
 
02:24:11.389 --> 02:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
so they had a different but it had a
 
02:24:13.550 --> 02:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and so
 
02:24:15.770 --> 02:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
um I I think my testimony
 
02:24:18.170 --> 02:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
um disputed that um I did definitely did
 
02:24:20.889 --> 02:24:20.899 align:start position:0%
yeah because the the federal government
 
02:24:25.070 --> 02:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
HHS who oversees those um the the
 
02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
compliance has indicated otherwise so
 
02:24:31.010 --> 02:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately is there was
 
02:24:31.020 --> 02:24:32.330 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately is there was
misinformation

02:24:32.330 --> 02:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
misinformation
 
02:24:34.429 --> 02:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
um and because this this company that
 
02:24:36.050 --> 02:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
they were referencing
 
02:24:39.889 --> 02:24:39.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:42.410 --> 02:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh I don't have the letter in front of
 
02:24:45.110 --> 02:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
me but um when we sent oh the patient
 
02:24:48.889 --> 02:24:48.899 align:start position:0%
rights advocate.org and when we um sent
 
02:24:50.330 --> 02:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
a letter to the Attorney General's
 
02:24:50.340 --> 02:24:51.110 align:start position:0%
a letter to the Attorney General's
office

02:24:51.110 --> 02:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:24:53.030 --> 02:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
um that was also part of my testimony I
 
02:24:56.630 --> 02:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
think that clarified okay great so Mr
 
02:24:58.610 --> 02:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
chairman if it sounds like the
 
02:24:58.620 --> 02:24:59.929 align:start position:0%
chairman if it sounds like the
information

02:24:59.929 --> 02:24:59.939 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:25:03.530 --> 02:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
that was being that is being sought
 
02:25:07.969 --> 02:25:07.979 align:start position:0%
by this bill is already being required
 
02:25:11.870 --> 02:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
under federal statute is just not being
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
presented in the same way or the same
 
02:25:17.809 --> 02:25:17.819 align:start position:0%
format or whatever as envisioned by the
 
02:25:19.370 --> 02:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill
 
02:25:22.370 --> 02:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh so we really don't have a lack of
 
02:25:24.590 --> 02:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
information we do have the information
 
02:25:27.650 --> 02:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
it's there and to the entrepreneur issue
 
02:25:27.660 --> 02:25:30.230 align:start position:0%
it's there and to the entrepreneur issue
apparently

02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
um we don't NEC we don't need a law in
 
02:25:36.050 --> 02:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
order to make the market work it sounds
 
02:25:38.510 --> 02:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
like even though Colorado may be a
 
02:25:40.670 --> 02:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
little further along with respect to
 
02:25:43.849 --> 02:25:43.859 align:start position:0%
startups in the technology that it's
 
02:25:45.650 --> 02:25:45.660 align:start position:0%
it's it's already starting to happen
 
02:25:48.469 --> 02:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire so the the major
 
02:25:50.450 --> 02:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
concerns that are being addressed by
 
02:25:51.530 --> 02:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:25:54.170 --> 02:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
or thought to be addressed by this bill
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
have already been addressed
 
02:26:00.050 --> 02:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
so we don't need to pass something if
 
02:26:03.830 --> 02:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
the objectives sought in this bill are
 
02:26:06.050 --> 02:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
already being fulfilled
 
02:26:12.170 --> 02:26:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:14.929 --> 02:26:14.939 align:start position:0%
I'm not a voting member so you're you're
 
02:26:17.330 --> 02:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
going to get to vote on it well next
 
02:26:20.530 --> 02:26:20.540 align:start position:0%
week so right we votes the committee
 
02:26:24.170 --> 02:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:26.090 --> 02:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
I guess I
 
02:26:28.730 --> 02:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
I would like to know if if they are in
 
02:26:30.170 --> 02:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
compliance I know she's saying there are
 
02:26:32.030 --> 02:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
I would like and then
 
02:26:34.490 --> 02:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
when I spoke to the
 
02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
um representative Phillips I think was
 
02:26:38.389 --> 02:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
her name I mean she said that they
 
02:26:39.530 --> 02:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
weren't and so they seemed to be
 
02:26:42.830 --> 02:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
discrepancy and I'd like to know how we
 
02:26:45.770 --> 02:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
know that for sure and
 
02:26:45.780 --> 02:26:46.670 align:start position:0%
know that for sure and
um

02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
I mean I remember the testimony but uh
 
02:26:52.910 --> 02:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I guess what is the
 
02:26:54.590 --> 02:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
mechanism right now if they're not in
 
02:26:56.570 --> 02:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
compliance with the federal law who's in
 
02:26:58.550 --> 02:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
charge of enforcing that is that Federal
 
02:27:01.790 --> 02:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
Federal HHS the hospitals are have to
 
02:27:03.410 --> 02:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
follow Federal that's what happens when
 
02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
they don't so they there are major
 
02:27:09.410 --> 02:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
penalties um but I am happy to I mean if
 
02:27:11.990 --> 02:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
so if you want I mean every single yes
 
02:27:14.570 --> 02:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
so the question here is I'm hearing he
 
02:27:16.610 --> 02:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
said she said which do I know is true
 
02:27:19.250 --> 02:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
can you provide for representative
 
02:27:21.050 --> 02:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
Sullivan and the rest of us who may be
 
02:27:24.170 --> 02:27:24.180 align:start position:0%
interested the documentation to
 
02:27:26.809 --> 02:27:26.819 align:start position:0%
definitively defend your position such
 
02:27:29.750 --> 02:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
that the claim being made by the
 
02:27:33.530 --> 02:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
sponsors is shown to be deficient
 
02:27:36.889 --> 02:27:36.899 align:start position:0%
yes I was going to say if he settles he
 
02:27:39.650 --> 02:27:39.660 align:start position:0%
should she say right we can go on every
 
02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
Hospital's website and give you the URL
 
02:27:46.250 --> 02:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
that shows that they are in fact doing
 
02:27:49.730 --> 02:27:49.740 align:start position:0%
what the no surprises act Law requires
 
02:27:52.730 --> 02:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
them to do would that help
 
02:27:55.370 --> 02:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
yeah well that settles the dispute am I
 
02:27:56.870 --> 02:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
looking the right thing is this
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet here there was the Sim third
 
02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
semi-annual Hospital price transpirinary
 
02:28:06.110 --> 02:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
report from New Hampshire compliance
 
02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
is that the chart that I handed out I
 
02:28:10.670 --> 02:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
don't know what that is I don't think
 
02:28:12.349 --> 02:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
you hit it out because half the hot more
 
02:28:13.250 --> 02:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
than half the hospitals are
 
02:28:15.550 --> 02:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
non-compliant no that's the one
 
02:28:19.070 --> 02:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
oh okay yeah I did not get his testimony
 
02:28:21.290 --> 02:28:21.300 align:start position:0%
and then their explanation of why my
 
02:28:25.250 --> 02:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
hospital is standard charges file fails
 
02:28:27.230 --> 02:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
to provide an adequate amount of
 
02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
negotiated minimum negotiated negotiate
 
02:28:34.010 --> 02:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
minimum negotiated maximum or negotiated
 
02:28:34.020 --> 02:28:52.330 align:start position:0%
minimum negotiated maximum or negotiated
rates

02:28:52.330 --> 02:28:52.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:55.969 --> 02:28:55.979 align:start position:0%
yes so you're asking the hospitals to
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
supply metrics one set of metrics for
 
02:28:59.690 --> 02:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
the federal government and one set of
 
02:29:01.370 --> 02:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
metrics for the state government and we
 
02:29:03.950 --> 02:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
get a report that that there are certain
 
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals that are not apparently
 
02:29:08.870 --> 02:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
supplying all of the the data for the
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
metrics that are required whereas what
 
02:29:13.309 --> 02:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that with respect to
 
02:29:15.770 --> 02:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
the federal metrics the data is being
 
02:29:15.780 --> 02:29:16.870 align:start position:0%
the federal metrics the data is being
completely

02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
completely
 
02:29:21.290 --> 02:29:21.300 align:start position:0%
supplied right and and therefore the the
 
02:29:23.510 --> 02:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
legislation is being satisfied with
 
02:29:25.309 --> 02:29:25.319 align:start position:0%
respect to compliance here in New
 
02:29:27.650 --> 02:29:27.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right so there was a chart
 
02:29:31.370 --> 02:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
that I handed out with my testimony
 
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
from my testimony was that my that my
 
02:29:44.210 --> 02:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
testimony yeah and there's a chart now
 
02:29:46.610 --> 02:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
there was a letter and a chart
 
02:29:46.620 --> 02:29:49.730 align:start position:0%
there was a letter and a chart
um

02:29:49.730 --> 02:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:52.429 --> 02:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
okay so do you have a copy of this do
 
02:29:54.349 --> 02:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
you know no I don't
 
02:29:56.469 --> 02:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
know so this is from
 
02:29:58.750 --> 02:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
patient rights
 
02:30:01.309 --> 02:30:01.319 align:start position:0%
advocate.org yeah unfortunately that's
 
02:30:03.290 --> 02:30:03.300 align:start position:0%
attached to my testimony but that is not
 
02:30:05.570 --> 02:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
my the chart I will send you I don't
 
02:30:07.849 --> 02:30:07.859 align:start position:0%
know what happened there is a colored
 
02:30:07.859 --> 02:30:09.349 align:start position:0%
know what happened there is a colored
chart

02:30:09.349 --> 02:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
chart
 
02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
can I just do you mind if I just look at
 
02:30:13.250 --> 02:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
that real quick so the one thing I could
 
02:30:15.349 --> 02:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
say is this was all
 
02:30:19.070 --> 02:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
these were uh last May and June
 
02:30:21.770 --> 02:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
so and so it'd be nice to see what's the
 
02:30:25.309 --> 02:30:25.319 align:start position:0%
latest their latest the screening is so
 
02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
this this with the yes and no's that is
 
02:30:32.270 --> 02:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
our analysis of the patient advocate
 
02:30:36.050 --> 02:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
again what they were using in their um
 
02:30:40.010 --> 02:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
report in their audit versus what CMS
 
02:30:42.290 --> 02:30:42.300 align:start position:0%
requires which the hospitals have to
 
02:30:42.300 --> 02:30:43.429 align:start position:0%
requires which the hospitals have to
follow

02:30:43.429 --> 02:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
follow
 
02:30:45.710 --> 02:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
um because they are all
 
02:30:47.750 --> 02:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
have to be compliant with the federal
 
02:30:51.410 --> 02:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
government because they are CMS um CMS
 
02:30:53.330 --> 02:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
over you know so they'll lose some of
 
02:30:55.309 --> 02:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
their CS they they can't be Medicare or
 
02:30:58.610 --> 02:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um they would lose providers so
 
02:31:01.490 --> 02:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
what we did is compare and then we can
 
02:31:04.610 --> 02:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
show where the requirements match and
 
02:31:06.830 --> 02:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
most of them do not so that's what this
 
02:31:06.840 --> 02:31:07.969 align:start position:0%
most of them do not so that's what this
is

02:31:07.969 --> 02:31:07.979 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:31:10.429 --> 02:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
but I think there was another chart that
 
02:31:12.770 --> 02:31:12.780 align:start position:0%
the other group might have handed out
 
02:31:14.450 --> 02:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
that I have not seen so how about we
 
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
just retain this and keep on I would
 
02:31:18.590 --> 02:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
have to say on the face of it my problem
 
02:31:21.530 --> 02:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
is I am very reluctant to be in the
 
02:31:24.290 --> 02:31:24.300 align:start position:0%
enforcer of federal laws
 
02:31:26.750 --> 02:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
and and passing state laws to enforce
 
02:31:28.370 --> 02:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
federal laws that's fair
 
02:31:29.870 --> 02:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
um and so that's that's where my
 
02:31:32.450 --> 02:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
reluctance to get into this bill but uh
 
02:31:33.889 --> 02:31:33.899 align:start position:0%
and then you're also imposing a second
 
02:31:35.990 --> 02:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
set of requirements according to
 
02:31:38.450 --> 02:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
patients rights advocacy that they have
 
02:31:40.250 --> 02:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
these different metrics so now we're
 
02:31:41.690 --> 02:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
saying to the hospitals well now you got
 
02:31:44.450 --> 02:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
to supply these the responses on the
 
02:31:47.150 --> 02:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
basis of these metrics to CMS right and
 
02:31:48.710 --> 02:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
then you got to support now we get this
 
02:31:50.990 --> 02:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
other set of metrics and now you got to
 
02:31:53.510 --> 02:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
employ people to develop the responses
 
02:31:56.090 --> 02:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
to these which is a new mandate that
 
02:31:57.469 --> 02:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
would be a state mandate so you got
 
02:31:59.990 --> 02:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
double you got double mandate and and
 
02:32:01.969 --> 02:32:01.979 align:start position:0%
what's generating our mandate is some
 
02:32:03.889 --> 02:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
third-party organization that you know
 
02:32:06.050 --> 02:32:06.060 align:start position:0%
so my question is what's unsatisfactory
 
02:32:08.090 --> 02:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
about the federal government I think
 
02:32:09.110 --> 02:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's actually not what the law is
 
02:32:10.309 --> 02:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
trying to do because it says that
 
02:32:12.230 --> 02:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
they're trying to convene make sure
 
02:32:13.969 --> 02:32:13.979 align:start position:0%
they're in compliant with federal laws
 
02:32:15.530 --> 02:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought yeah that's how I
 
02:32:17.990 --> 02:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
read the law I read the bills they
 
02:32:19.070 --> 02:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
weren't the hospital administration's
 
02:32:20.750 --> 02:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
arguing that they are but I think that
 
02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
they're not trying to create a second
 
02:32:24.230 --> 02:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
mandate but they were they were they
 
02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
they they insisted that the website be
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
up to date like almost momentarily when
 
02:32:31.490 --> 02:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
she was talking when the representative
 
02:32:33.230 --> 02:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
was talking they expected it to be
 
02:32:36.410 --> 02:32:36.420 align:start position:0%
updated Dynamic very quickly and also
 
02:32:39.110 --> 02:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
much more accurately than we could ever
 
02:32:41.450 --> 02:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
hope to do
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
so it is a set of other regulations on
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
top of the federal regulations in effect
 
02:32:48.590 --> 02:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
it's a new mandate may not be doable is
 
02:32:50.510 --> 02:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
it is that in here I don't see that
 
02:32:52.849 --> 02:32:52.859 align:start position:0%
anywhere in here no she just saying that
 
02:32:54.349 --> 02:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
that's what that was the test I think
 
02:32:56.270 --> 02:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
she was saying that right because you
 
02:32:58.969 --> 02:32:58.979 align:start position:0%
know frankly if if we were to pass this
 
02:33:01.550 --> 02:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
I that I would want us to specifically
 
02:33:05.450 --> 02:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
state which web page is the one
 
02:33:08.750 --> 02:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
to be used I wouldn't say if you can
 
02:33:11.809 --> 02:33:11.819 align:start position:0%
come in with any any old third party and
 
02:33:13.309 --> 02:33:13.319 align:start position:0%
say you know they've got evidence
 
02:33:13.319 --> 02:33:15.170 align:start position:0%
say you know they've got evidence
differently

02:33:15.170 --> 02:33:15.180 align:start position:0%
differently
 
02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
um you know you would actually if you're
 
02:33:18.349 --> 02:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
going to try to enforce it or you at
 
02:33:20.450 --> 02:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
least hold up in court if not that they
 
02:33:22.429 --> 02:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
would go there but to have legitimacy
 
02:33:25.730 --> 02:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
it's got to be from a uh recognize we
 
02:33:27.349 --> 02:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
got a in our statue we've got to
 
02:33:30.170 --> 02:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
recognize the actual entity in which is
 
02:33:33.770 --> 02:33:33.780 align:start position:0%
being the uh the I agree with that and
 
02:33:35.270 --> 02:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
what hospitals even want to start
 
02:33:37.969 --> 02:33:37.979 align:start position:0%
entering data in yet a second database
 
02:33:40.910 --> 02:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
didn't we just hear it loud and clear is
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
that this is this you're never going to
 
02:33:45.170 --> 02:33:45.180 align:start position:0%
get a good note you're never going to
 
02:33:46.730 --> 02:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
get and you're never going to get them
 
02:33:48.830 --> 02:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
to agree this is feel good law
 
02:33:50.750 --> 02:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
legislation frankly
 
02:33:53.630 --> 02:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
and oh that that's right Senator Hassan
 
02:33:55.490 --> 02:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
was the sponsor wasn't she
 
02:33:58.550 --> 02:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
and why why do we need to require the
 
02:34:02.090 --> 02:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
state to do something where there is a
 
02:34:05.870 --> 02:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
an asserted failure uh at the of the
 
02:34:08.090 --> 02:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
federal at the federal level when it's
 
02:34:10.370 --> 02:34:10.380 align:start position:0%
not been demonstrated that there is in
 
02:34:13.010 --> 02:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
fact non-compliance with the Federal
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
Regulations I mean do we really have
 
02:34:17.210 --> 02:34:17.220 align:start position:0%
something here that's going to improve
 
02:34:19.969 --> 02:34:19.979 align:start position:0%
uh on the on the Federal Regulations I
 
02:34:22.130 --> 02:34:22.140 align:start position:0%
did not hear that from the from the
 
02:34:22.140 --> 02:34:23.389 align:start position:0%
did not hear that from the from the
sponsors

02:34:23.389 --> 02:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
sponsors
 
02:34:23.399 --> 02:34:26.450 align:start position:0%
sponsors
okay

02:34:26.450 --> 02:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:29.929 --> 02:34:29.939 align:start position:0%
so um help me understand the compliance
 
02:34:29.939 --> 02:34:33.530 align:start position:0%
so um help me understand the compliance
so

02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:35.929 --> 02:34:35.939 align:start position:0%
who says how are the New Hampshire
 
02:34:38.030 --> 02:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals notified that they're either
 
02:34:40.550 --> 02:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
in or out of compliance and then what
 
02:34:43.250 --> 02:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
are the existing penalties
 
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
so the no surprises Act is very
 
02:34:50.030 --> 02:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
extensive and there are requirements
 
02:34:52.550 --> 02:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
that a that the federal government is
 
02:34:55.190 --> 02:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
the one that um the the entity that will
 
02:34:58.250 --> 02:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
be auditing the hospitals and have done
 
02:35:00.170 --> 02:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
this periodically
 
02:35:02.510 --> 02:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
um with all our many of the hospitals
 
02:35:04.250 --> 02:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
throughout the country I think the
 
02:35:06.110 --> 02:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
biggest issue is
 
02:35:09.050 --> 02:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
what was being touted as saying the
 
02:35:10.670 --> 02:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
hospitals are not in compliance was
 
02:35:13.010 --> 02:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
using this other entity that did this
 
02:35:15.650 --> 02:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
study did not follow the federal
 
02:35:17.809 --> 02:35:17.819 align:start position:0%
government the hospitals have to follow
 
02:35:22.429 --> 02:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
the federal law so this other entity
 
02:35:25.790 --> 02:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
um this this independent Patient
 
02:35:29.090 --> 02:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
Advocate did a different study and
 
02:35:32.090 --> 02:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
that's what the sponsor was using to say
 
02:35:33.969 --> 02:35:33.979 align:start position:0%
that the hospitals are not in compliance
 
02:35:37.070 --> 02:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
my contention is they are in compliance
 
02:35:39.170 --> 02:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
because we have already checked and the
 
02:35:40.969 --> 02:35:40.979 align:start position:0%
state the federal government has not
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
cited them for not being in compliance
 
02:35:47.690 --> 02:35:47.700 align:start position:0%
so the other problem is if you're not in
 
02:35:50.570 --> 02:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
material compliance then that's the new
 
02:35:53.570 --> 02:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
part of the and I agree with um
 
02:35:56.270 --> 02:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
representative spirit that um there are
 
02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
two standards because then if they're
 
02:36:00.710 --> 02:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
not in compliance according to who then
 
02:36:03.349 --> 02:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
the patient will be responsible will not
 
02:36:05.630 --> 02:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
be responsible so you're then creating
 
02:36:08.990 --> 02:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
this other other issue of collections or
 
02:36:11.570 --> 02:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
not being able to collect so it just
 
02:36:13.730 --> 02:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
added another layer that's the piece
 
02:36:16.550 --> 02:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's the difference then it's still
 
02:36:19.130 --> 02:36:19.140 align:start position:0%
the federal no surprises act but again
 
02:36:21.950 --> 02:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
our contention is it is not necessary
 
02:36:24.950 --> 02:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
because they are in compliance with
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
they're not I mean I'm the hospitals are
 
02:36:29.330 --> 02:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
not are not going to be required to
 
02:36:31.309 --> 02:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
follow the patient advocate and the
 
02:36:32.870 --> 02:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
criteria sounds like they're different
 
02:36:36.290 --> 02:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
like my as my chart shows the criteria
 
02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
are different so of course the results
 
02:36:39.050 --> 02:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
are going to be different so
 
02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative Waltz
 
02:36:43.429 --> 02:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
just a question why would you retain
 
02:36:47.690 --> 02:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
versus itl yeah uh
 
02:36:51.530 --> 02:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman absent rebuttal okay this Mr
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
chairman absent rebuttal from the
 
02:36:56.270 --> 02:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor or one of the co-sponsors and
 
02:36:58.790 --> 02:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
neither one of them are here today I
 
02:37:02.150 --> 02:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
don't know how we retain something that
 
02:37:05.690 --> 02:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
has been demonstrably shown as being
 
02:37:08.450 --> 02:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
unnecessary okay
 
02:37:08.460 --> 02:37:13.850 align:start position:0%
unnecessary okay
okay

02:37:13.850 --> 02:37:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:13.860 --> 02:37:19.150 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

02:37:19.150 --> 02:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh so someone else a member of this uh
 
02:37:28.190 --> 02:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:30.110 --> 02:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
seconded by
 
02:37:32.349 --> 02:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
representative post
 
02:37:36.770 --> 02:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
moves itl any discussion on the motion
 
02:37:39.889 --> 02:37:39.899 align:start position:0%
see none the clerk will call oh no all
 
02:37:43.370 --> 02:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
those in favor say aye one two three
 
02:37:54.250 --> 02:37:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:57.290 --> 02:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
seven zero
 
02:37:57.300 --> 02:38:03.469 align:start position:0%
seven zero
okay

02:38:03.469 --> 02:38:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:07.190 --> 02:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay one to go last to go relative
 
02:38:08.450 --> 02:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
health insurance coverage for
 
02:38:16.070 --> 02:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:19.190 --> 02:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
this is a health insurance mandate
 
02:38:21.469 --> 02:38:21.479 align:start position:0%
well the
 
02:38:24.050 --> 02:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
the if I understand this building is he
 
02:38:25.790 --> 02:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
is the sponsor here
 
02:38:28.070 --> 02:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
oh there she is my understanding of the
 
02:38:30.230 --> 02:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
bill is that if someone
 
02:38:33.650 --> 02:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
someone wants a procedure
 
02:38:36.889 --> 02:38:36.899 align:start position:0%
and says the reason she he or she wants
 
02:38:40.070 --> 02:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
it is because they have high P fast
 
02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:41.450 align:start position:0%
it is because they have high P fast
numbers

02:38:41.450 --> 02:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
02:38:41.460 --> 02:38:43.070 align:start position:0%
numbers
then

02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:38:46.309 --> 02:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
then they have to do the procedure that
 
02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
we're mandating the procedure has to go
 
02:38:49.309 --> 02:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
forward not quite
 
02:38:52.250 --> 02:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
um okay so it it all what what triggers
 
02:38:55.610 --> 02:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
the the uh not the procedures but the
 
02:38:58.010 --> 02:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
follow-up and the monitoring and the the
 
02:39:00.349 --> 02:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
um oversight of these people is if you
 
02:39:03.770 --> 02:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
have a blood test and it's above that 20
 
02:39:06.230 --> 02:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
point limit so that's what triggers all
 
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
of this care
 
02:39:10.849 --> 02:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
that that 300 pages of care so it could
 
02:39:12.950 --> 02:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
start you know with an infant you know
 
02:39:15.290 --> 02:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
so you don't you don't wait for symptoms
 
02:39:17.210 --> 02:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
you you get the blood test and that's
 
02:39:19.370 --> 02:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
that's what triggers it
 
02:39:22.070 --> 02:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
so but but what is the procedure that
 
02:39:23.929 --> 02:39:23.939 align:start position:0%
you're then requiring
 
02:39:26.750 --> 02:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
it it's all outlined in those those 300
 
02:39:29.030 --> 02:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
pages so for an infant
 
02:39:31.070 --> 02:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
um you would have screenings for
 
02:39:33.050 --> 02:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
Disabilities you'd have screenings for
 
02:39:36.230 --> 02:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
autism you would um starting I think
 
02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
they they say at age one that you start
 
02:39:41.450 --> 02:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
testing for cholesterol
 
02:39:43.849 --> 02:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
um and and high blood sugar
 
02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
so and these are things that that you
 
02:39:47.630 --> 02:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
know a one-year-old is not going to be
 
02:39:50.030 --> 02:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
able to tell you I've got no I'm not
 
02:39:51.830 --> 02:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
worried about that part what I'm praying
 
02:39:53.570 --> 02:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
about is when we talk about mandates in
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
02:39:58.370 --> 02:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
um and and and I guess just give a
 
02:40:00.490 --> 02:40:00.500 align:start position:0%
historic perspective many years ago
 
02:40:04.190 --> 02:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock wanted to try for
 
02:40:06.349 --> 02:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
breast cancer uh for solid breast
 
02:40:09.429 --> 02:40:09.439 align:start position:0%
cancers they wanted to try to do
 
02:40:12.770 --> 02:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy to this and
 
02:40:15.230 --> 02:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
um and and they're basically put this
 
02:40:18.650 --> 02:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
committee as plain doctor right we had
 
02:40:20.030 --> 02:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
to determine whether this was
 
02:40:23.150 --> 02:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate care we're bypassing the
 
02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
medical directors of the insurance
 
02:40:26.450 --> 02:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
companies and we were going to
 
02:40:28.790 --> 02:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
unilaterally make this decision right we
 
02:40:31.010 --> 02:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
passed it it turns out that they only
 
02:40:32.270 --> 02:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
did it for a year and then realized it
 
02:40:34.969 --> 02:40:34.979 align:start position:0%
didn't work Okay so
 
02:40:38.090 --> 02:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
now I'm I'm uh as carrier of that
 
02:40:41.030 --> 02:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
history okay is I'm I'm emphasizing is
 
02:40:43.610 --> 02:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
is that what we have what we want to
 
02:40:45.110 --> 02:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
deal with is
 
02:40:48.889 --> 02:40:48.899 align:start position:0%
um we have situations where if that
 
02:40:48.899 --> 02:40:49.849 align:start position:0%
um we have situations where if that
um

02:40:49.849 --> 02:40:49.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:53.030 --> 02:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
let's take the rest was we found out
 
02:40:54.710 --> 02:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
that some insurance companies were
 
02:40:57.349 --> 02:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
waiting for a year and a day
 
02:40:58.849 --> 02:40:58.859 align:start position:0%
in other words in terms of they were
 
02:41:01.130 --> 02:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
saying they were doing breast uh tests
 
02:41:02.870 --> 02:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
every two years rather than doing
 
02:41:05.389 --> 02:41:05.399 align:start position:0%
annually yeah so then
 
02:41:07.610 --> 02:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
we we were now
 
02:41:10.370 --> 02:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh the legislation was for us to mandate
 
02:41:13.010 --> 02:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
that yes it can be done manually all
 
02:41:14.690 --> 02:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
right so
 
02:41:16.429 --> 02:41:16.439 align:start position:0%
um what we're trying to what we're
 
02:41:18.349 --> 02:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
dealing with in any legislation when it
 
02:41:20.750 --> 02:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
comes to these Health procedures is that
 
02:41:22.730 --> 02:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with an insurance company
 
02:41:28.010 --> 02:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
won't do a procedure which that um that
 
02:41:31.070 --> 02:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
your physician or the the generally
 
02:41:33.469 --> 02:41:33.479 align:start position:0%
accepted Medical Practice
 
02:41:36.290 --> 02:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
okay has said that that is appropriate
 
02:41:38.929 --> 02:41:38.939 align:start position:0%
that that is these are appropriate so
 
02:41:41.929 --> 02:41:41.939 align:start position:0%
that you have to in terms of way I read
 
02:41:44.389 --> 02:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
this bill it seemed very open-ended it
 
02:41:46.910 --> 02:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't specific it's very specific to
 
02:41:48.770 --> 02:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
the guidelines and those are CDC
 
02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines so that 300 Page there was
 
02:41:52.610 --> 02:41:52.620 align:start position:0%
some confusion
 
02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
um up here about where that that
 
02:41:58.849 --> 02:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
document came from the CDC can uh can
 
02:42:01.490 --> 02:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
got our con what I can't think of the
 
02:42:04.010 --> 02:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
word contracted with with that agency to
 
02:42:06.290 --> 02:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
develop these guidelines which are going
 
02:42:08.210 --> 02:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
to be adopted by the CDC they were
 
02:42:10.250 --> 02:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
supposed to be adopted in December but
 
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's been a change of directors So
 
02:42:13.490 --> 02:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
eventually these guidelines are going to
 
02:42:15.710 --> 02:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
be adopted they're they're in use in a
 
02:42:18.349 --> 02:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
pediatric center right now and they're
 
02:42:24.710 --> 02:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:28.190 --> 02:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Silent Springs organization on
 
02:42:31.130 --> 02:42:31.140 align:start position:0%
the cape which is they do a lot of pfas
 
02:42:31.140 --> 02:42:32.330 align:start position:0%
the cape which is they do a lot of pfas
research

02:42:32.330 --> 02:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
research
 
02:42:36.590 --> 02:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
okay so and then and so if you're tested
 
02:42:38.210 --> 02:42:38.220 align:start position:0%
and you have these things what are we
 
02:42:40.010 --> 02:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
mandating which proceed what procedure
 
02:42:41.870 --> 02:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
what are we mandating at that point all
 
02:42:44.690 --> 02:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
of them all of them what is all that all
 
02:42:46.849 --> 02:42:46.859 align:start position:0%
is not a good word uh what is the
 
02:42:48.530 --> 02:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
specific okay representative Calabro
 
02:42:50.210 --> 02:42:50.220 align:start position:0%
thinks he's an expert on this issue so
 
02:42:53.690 --> 02:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
let's hear it not an expert I just read
 
02:42:55.550 --> 02:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
the 300 Pages
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
um brilliant thank you an expert
 
02:42:59.750 --> 02:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
um well I felt it was imperative seeing
 
02:43:03.590 --> 02:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
that I am a PCP so um this is pertinent
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
to me thank you um I was very ill about
 
02:43:07.790 --> 02:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
halfway through it reading these
 
02:43:09.889 --> 02:43:09.899 align:start position:0%
protocols being aware of what is coming
 
02:43:11.390 --> 02:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
down the pipeline
 
02:43:11.400 --> 02:43:11.870 align:start position:0%
down the pipeline
[Music]

02:43:11.870 --> 02:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:13.610 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:43:13.610 --> 02:43:13.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:15.770 --> 02:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
I was concerned
 
02:43:18.290 --> 02:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
um as a PCP who's being inundated
 
02:43:20.170 --> 02:43:20.180 align:start position:0%
fighting insurance companies every day
 
02:43:22.309 --> 02:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
something like this is going to impact
 
02:43:24.650 --> 02:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
me pretty badly
 
02:43:26.870 --> 02:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
um trying to order anything Medicare
 
02:43:29.210 --> 02:43:29.220 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that is not completely covered
 
02:43:31.910 --> 02:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
already is a huge battle we're already
 
02:43:33.969 --> 02:43:33.979 align:start position:0%
under staff or you know profits are bad
 
02:43:38.330 --> 02:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
so make this make sense for me
 
02:43:41.150 --> 02:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
how are we going to
 
02:43:44.090 --> 02:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
this is a start this is a start so I'm
 
02:43:46.490 --> 02:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
in touch with our federal delegation to
 
02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
try to get this passed also on a
 
02:43:50.450 --> 02:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
national level right
 
02:43:52.969 --> 02:43:52.979 align:start position:0%
and further inquiry further question
 
02:43:54.170 --> 02:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
they inquired
 
02:43:57.290 --> 02:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
once it is adopted federally and we know
 
02:43:59.450 --> 02:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
there's delays and when that's going to
 
02:44:01.969 --> 02:44:01.979 align:start position:0%
happen that I agree with you this is how
 
02:44:03.469 --> 02:44:03.479 align:start position:0%
I'm going to practice medicine going
 
02:44:05.990 --> 02:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
forward to cover my butt thank you okay
 
02:44:08.870 --> 02:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
yeah but but the reality is insurance
 
02:44:10.849 --> 02:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
companies may not be quite so forthright
 
02:44:13.670 --> 02:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
to support those protocols which is why
 
02:44:16.010 --> 02:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
we need to mandate them
 
02:44:18.349 --> 02:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
because these these these Protocols are
 
02:44:20.450 --> 02:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
not silly protocols as you if you've
 
02:44:21.889 --> 02:44:21.899 align:start position:0%
read the document I mean they're they're
 
02:44:24.469 --> 02:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
very specific it's real start with with
 
02:44:27.050 --> 02:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
birth essentially actually it starts
 
02:44:28.969 --> 02:44:28.979 align:start position:0%
with pre-birth because the mother has to
 
02:44:30.530 --> 02:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
be tested
 
02:44:33.349 --> 02:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
um and goes so it's it's Cradle to to
 
02:44:36.770 --> 02:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
casket you know birth to death all of
 
02:44:39.469 --> 02:44:39.479 align:start position:0%
these and and so it's
 
02:44:42.650 --> 02:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
as you get older you know you don't get
 
02:44:44.510 --> 02:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
the same tests every single year you get
 
02:44:46.429 --> 02:44:46.439 align:start position:0%
modified tests based on the criteria
 
02:44:48.590 --> 02:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
that was established and if you look at
 
02:44:50.210 --> 02:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
the first page of that document I mean
 
02:44:52.730 --> 02:44:52.740 align:start position:0%
there's many many organizations that
 
02:44:55.190 --> 02:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
have contributed to this this is not oh
 
02:44:57.349 --> 02:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
it's cumulative meta-analysis I think
 
02:44:58.610 --> 02:44:58.620 align:start position:0%
from everything throughout the country
 
02:45:00.530 --> 02:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
basically to try and bring forth
 
02:45:02.450 --> 02:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
something that the CDC will say yes this
 
02:45:05.690 --> 02:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
is fine right and I get that and so and
 
02:45:07.730 --> 02:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
if if you recall the reason that this
 
02:45:09.770 --> 02:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
came about is that I had an operation
 
02:45:13.070 --> 02:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
that was initially denied and I had um I
 
02:45:15.530 --> 02:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
heard of a young woman in our town who
 
02:45:17.690 --> 02:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
has breast issues and she was told she
 
02:45:20.570 --> 02:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
was too young you know so so that's the
 
02:45:22.910 --> 02:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
reason is that we have a p pass problem
 
02:45:24.950 --> 02:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire we have it you know
 
02:45:27.950 --> 02:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
it's here we're we're suffering and so
 
02:45:30.050 --> 02:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
this is a way to protect and to
 
02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
Institute so just because the CDC is
 
02:45:34.429 --> 02:45:34.439 align:start position:0%
going to adopt these guidelines doesn't
 
02:45:36.650 --> 02:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that all of the states
 
02:45:39.910 --> 02:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
are going to adopt them you know or that
 
02:45:42.349 --> 02:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are going to adopt
 
02:45:42.359 --> 02:45:43.309 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are going to adopt
them

02:45:43.309 --> 02:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:45:46.010 --> 02:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
you know I we're going to uncover a lot
 
02:45:48.590 --> 02:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
of problems earlier which is good for
 
02:45:50.450 --> 02:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
people but it's not good for insurance
 
02:45:50.460 --> 02:45:52.690 align:start position:0%
people but it's not good for insurance
companies

02:45:52.690 --> 02:45:52.700 align:start position:0%
companies
 
02:45:55.490 --> 02:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
right and you realize this only affects
 
02:45:57.349 --> 02:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
a third of the state's population I do
 
02:45:59.510 --> 02:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
which is why I am in touch with the uh
 
02:46:01.730 --> 02:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
the federal delegation to see if we can
 
02:46:04.010 --> 02:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
maybe do something for Medicaid or
 
02:46:05.990 --> 02:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
Medicare right
 
02:46:07.610 --> 02:46:07.620 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman
 
02:46:09.710 --> 02:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative Rose
 
02:46:11.270 --> 02:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
um just just before I asked my question
 
02:46:13.730 --> 02:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
you said it only impacts one-third do
 
02:46:14.990 --> 02:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
you mean because it's in the southern
 
02:46:18.349 --> 02:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
part of the state no because under our
 
02:46:21.469 --> 02:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
statutes there that other entities are
 
02:46:26.090 --> 02:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
exempt so if you're Medicare Medicaid or
 
02:46:28.490 --> 02:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
an employer large employer which is
 
02:46:31.250 --> 02:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
known erisa yeah we our legislation
 
02:46:33.530 --> 02:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
can't affect them okay all right so this
 
02:46:36.170 --> 02:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
only is for small employers all right
 
02:46:38.630 --> 02:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
small employers and the individual
 
02:46:40.309 --> 02:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
Market because I assume I can't seem to
 
02:46:44.389 --> 02:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:47.870 --> 02:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
and if I mean if somebody you
 
02:46:49.490 --> 02:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
02:46:49.500 --> 02:46:50.809 align:start position:0%
discussion about
hi

02:46:50.809 --> 02:46:50.819 align:start position:0%
hi
 
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
um breast cancer you know if you if they
 
02:46:56.929 --> 02:46:56.939 align:start position:0%
if a doctor or you find a mass you don't
 
02:46:58.490 --> 02:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
say well you can't have a mammogram
 
02:47:00.290 --> 02:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
because it's recommended in year two
 
02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
you're gonna go see what's about you're
 
02:47:03.530 --> 02:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
going to do a mammogram and see what
 
02:47:05.870 --> 02:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
treatment is and again if blood tests
 
02:47:08.450 --> 02:47:08.460 align:start position:0%
are showing that there's uh there's a
 
02:47:11.090 --> 02:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
problem here we got to pay for it to see
 
02:47:12.710 --> 02:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
what's going on right you know
 
02:47:14.630 --> 02:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
particularly given what we're seeing in
 
02:47:18.290 --> 02:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
terms of illness for people that you
 
02:47:19.670 --> 02:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
know just to use that breast cancer
 
02:47:19.680 --> 02:47:21.889 align:start position:0%
know just to use that breast cancer
example

02:47:21.889 --> 02:47:21.899 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:47:24.290 --> 02:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
um you may not know that you have breast
 
02:47:26.270 --> 02:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
cancer for years and years until you
 
02:47:28.490 --> 02:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
feel a mass or something like that so
 
02:47:30.290 --> 02:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
these young women and I'm talking early
 
02:47:32.270 --> 02:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
20s that are that are starting to be
 
02:47:34.790 --> 02:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
positive with cancer they there they
 
02:47:36.590 --> 02:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
might not even know that they have I
 
02:47:38.690 --> 02:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
mean we need preventive care
 
02:47:41.570 --> 02:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
excuse me for these these young women
 
02:47:44.210 --> 02:47:44.220 align:start position:0%
who have been horribly exposed to pfas I
 
02:47:46.550 --> 02:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
mean it the damage is done it's in their
 
02:47:48.590 --> 02:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
body now we need to take care of them I
 
02:47:51.050 --> 02:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
I totally agree with you yeah thank you
 
02:47:53.929 --> 02:47:53.939 align:start position:0%
what is the definition what what is the
 
02:47:56.450 --> 02:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
definition of preventative pfas care
 
02:47:58.849 --> 02:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
well it's essentially following the
 
02:48:01.010 --> 02:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
guidelines that are uh that are
 
02:48:05.330 --> 02:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:08.450 --> 02:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
um right and it you have to and the the
 
02:48:10.370 --> 02:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
insurance fellow that was here Alex I
 
02:48:11.530 --> 02:48:11.540 align:start position:0%
don't remember
 
02:48:14.510 --> 02:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and he was he was quoting from a
 
02:48:16.250 --> 02:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
chart and he was saying he couldn't
 
02:48:17.750 --> 02:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
understand what the problem was because
 
02:48:19.610 --> 02:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
the guidelines are already established
 
02:48:22.610 --> 02:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
that's a chart from that document that
 
02:48:25.010 --> 02:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
300 Page document right so therefore it
 
02:48:28.130 --> 02:48:28.140 align:start position:0%
is covered Mr Sherman it is why is it
 
02:48:30.410 --> 02:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
not covered because it hasn't been fully
 
02:48:33.530 --> 02:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
adopted yet cdc's may I ask for
 
02:48:35.270 --> 02:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
clarification yes representative Gibbs
 
02:48:36.530 --> 02:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:48:39.770 --> 02:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
um yes the CDC guidelines referenced in
 
02:48:40.670 --> 02:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:48:45.349 --> 02:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
the that is that 300 Page document which
 
02:48:47.389 --> 02:48:47.399 align:start position:0%
was developed
 
02:48:50.630 --> 02:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
um by an organization under a contract
 
02:48:53.690 --> 02:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
with the CDC but has not yet been
 
02:48:56.929 --> 02:48:56.939 align:start position:0%
adopted by the CDC but the CDC plans to
 
02:48:58.550 --> 02:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
adopt it is that correct it was supposed
 
02:49:00.530 --> 02:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
to be adopted within six months after
 
02:49:02.870 --> 02:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
publication however um and that would
 
02:49:05.389 --> 02:49:05.399 align:start position:0%
have been December of last year but
 
02:49:08.270 --> 02:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
there there's been a directorship change
 
02:49:11.389 --> 02:49:11.399 align:start position:0%
at the CDC and so they've they've put it
 
02:49:13.130 --> 02:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
on do we know when it is going to be
 
02:49:15.170 --> 02:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
adopted we don't know right now but
 
02:49:17.990 --> 02:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
there is no so the hold up is has
 
02:49:20.210 --> 02:49:20.220 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the content of the
 
02:49:22.010 --> 02:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
publication I wasn't asking about that I
 
02:49:23.750 --> 02:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
was just asking about them it has to do
 
02:49:24.950 --> 02:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
with with
 
02:49:27.230 --> 02:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
politics within not politics that's the
 
02:49:28.450 --> 02:49:28.460 align:start position:0%
wrong word but
 
02:49:30.950 --> 02:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
employee shuffling that's probably
 
02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:32.630 align:start position:0%
employee shuffling that's probably
better

02:49:32.630 --> 02:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
better
 
02:49:35.990 --> 02:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
but it is it your understanding and that
 
02:49:38.210 --> 02:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
of other stakeholders that this is going
 
02:49:40.969 --> 02:49:40.979 align:start position:0%
to be adopted in short order and that is
 
02:49:44.389 --> 02:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
that those are the guidelines correct
 
02:49:46.010 --> 02:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
that are specified in the bill correct
 
02:49:47.809 --> 02:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
thank you correct so what I'm trying to
 
02:49:52.130 --> 02:49:52.140 align:start position:0%
get at is that what is the preventative
 
02:49:55.070 --> 02:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
what is what is actually what is what
 
02:49:57.290 --> 02:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
what procedure or what process what
 
02:49:59.750 --> 02:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
medication what is being given that has
 
02:50:01.309 --> 02:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
not been given by insurance companies
 
02:50:01.319 --> 02:50:02.090 align:start position:0%
not been given by insurance companies
now

02:50:02.090 --> 02:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:50:04.490 --> 02:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
that's a very broad-based answer but if
 
02:50:06.650 --> 02:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
you were to talk if you walked into my
 
02:50:08.330 --> 02:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
office I'm going to do a blood level I'm
 
02:50:09.410 --> 02:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
going to go and I'm going to start from
 
02:50:11.090 --> 02:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
there right okay you got you got a big
 
02:50:12.410 --> 02:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
highlight memories of your foot yeah
 
02:50:13.969 --> 02:50:13.979 align:start position:0%
I've got to get your history I've got to
 
02:50:15.770 --> 02:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
get all of your history and I need to
 
02:50:17.750 --> 02:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
assess your risks according to these
 
02:50:20.750 --> 02:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
protocols great okay so when I see
 
02:50:22.790 --> 02:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
certain things say I get a red flag I
 
02:50:24.349 --> 02:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
get a feeling in my gut something's not
 
02:50:26.510 --> 02:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
quite right I may need to order Imaging
 
02:50:28.910 --> 02:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
I may need to order things to do further
 
02:50:31.610 --> 02:50:31.620 align:start position:0%
evaluation to look for those risks
 
02:50:33.650 --> 02:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
okay in a woman this is a little bit
 
02:50:37.250 --> 02:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
easier because of the of the um
 
02:50:41.150 --> 02:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
the way it plays in with hormones and
 
02:50:43.429 --> 02:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
how much more prevalent it is I feel
 
02:50:45.710 --> 02:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
going to be for women this is a little
 
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
bit more of an easy discussion as far as
 
02:50:49.790 --> 02:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
that's concerned but there are protocols
 
02:50:51.469 --> 02:50:51.479 align:start position:0%
these are the things that I have to
 
02:50:54.290 --> 02:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
follow okay these things will be adopted
 
02:50:56.750 --> 02:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
by the CDC the AMA will approve all of
 
02:50:59.090 --> 02:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
those things so nothing that's in that
 
02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
document that 300 Page document is under
 
02:51:02.750 --> 02:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
scrutiny or question
 
02:51:06.670 --> 02:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
okay it's just a timing thing here
 
02:51:09.410 --> 02:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
but again if we're going to be mandating
 
02:51:11.450 --> 02:51:11.460 align:start position:0%
something yes what are we actually
 
02:51:13.969 --> 02:51:13.979 align:start position:0%
Manning are we mandating that you should
 
02:51:21.730 --> 02:51:21.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:24.590 --> 02:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
yes so right now when you order when you
 
02:51:26.210 --> 02:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
say is a scan you have to put a
 
02:51:28.670 --> 02:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
diagnosis in right I would have to um
 
02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
and now you have an elevated piece I
 
02:51:31.969 --> 02:51:31.979 align:start position:0%
would have to find out what codes would
 
02:51:34.250 --> 02:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
be eligible first right before I play
 
02:51:36.650 --> 02:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
that game and then um and then and that
 
02:51:38.090 --> 02:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
way I don't end up having to well that's
 
02:51:39.349 --> 02:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying if you can already do
 
02:51:41.690 --> 02:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
that now then that won't be legislated
 
02:51:43.130 --> 02:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
because it's not covered yet it's not
 
02:51:45.830 --> 02:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
covered so you're saying that right now
 
02:51:48.610 --> 02:51:48.620 align:start position:0%
there is no code
 
02:51:50.929 --> 02:51:50.939 align:start position:0%
we're going to be mandating the creation
 
02:51:53.330 --> 02:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
of a code the codes exist okay so there
 
02:51:57.110 --> 02:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
is a code yes sir so the code is the
 
02:52:02.210 --> 02:52:02.220 align:start position:0%
this person has elevated pfas so and and
 
02:52:04.670 --> 02:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
you are concerned that this person might
 
02:52:06.889 --> 02:52:06.899 align:start position:0%
have a tumor growing in them so
 
02:52:09.469 --> 02:52:09.479 align:start position:0%
therefore you can't if you ordered up
 
02:52:09.479 --> 02:52:11.889 align:start position:0%
therefore you can't if you ordered up
this

02:52:11.889 --> 02:52:11.899 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:52:14.150 --> 02:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
the insurance company would fuse it
 
02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
02:52:17.870 --> 02:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
that's correct so if I have a patient
 
02:52:19.190 --> 02:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
you know what I want to do what I want
 
02:52:21.170 --> 02:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
to do is is I think I've just got that
 
02:52:22.670 --> 02:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
question out yeah
 
02:52:25.070 --> 02:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
we have insurance department and we have
 
02:52:27.769 --> 02:52:27.779 align:start position:0%
insurance companies we have I see
 
02:52:30.410 --> 02:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
three four here okay you know they're
 
02:52:32.929 --> 02:52:32.939 align:start position:0%
all represented here so that's your
 
02:52:37.610 --> 02:52:37.620 align:start position:0%
charge to tell us is the you are are you
 
02:52:40.670 --> 02:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
declining now these things so we need
 
02:52:42.830 --> 02:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
this information otherwise you know
 
02:52:44.150 --> 02:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise I think we would just
 
02:52:46.490 --> 02:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
otherwise let's retain the bill
 
02:52:48.710 --> 02:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
to I mean I I we can do we can do
 
02:52:50.870 --> 02:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
another hearing do this again next week
 
02:52:52.429 --> 02:52:52.439 align:start position:0%
you can bring them up you're gonna ask
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
them one two three four yeah and and
 
02:52:56.269 --> 02:52:56.279 align:start position:0%
they'll come up and they'll probably see
 
02:52:57.830 --> 02:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
whether they're gonna cover these things
 
02:52:59.750 --> 02:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll adjourn this
 
02:53:02.030 --> 02:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee unless representative you
 
02:53:10.550 --> 02:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:13.910 --> 02:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
um we were dealing with pfas there are
 
02:53:15.950 --> 02:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
so many different
 
02:53:18.170 --> 02:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
um variations of it that they were
 
02:53:21.650 --> 02:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
taking little chunks of it at a time to
 
02:53:24.830 --> 02:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
you know put them on the books so I mean
 
02:53:28.610 --> 02:53:28.620 align:start position:0%
I know we say pfas but that is a huge
 
02:53:30.469 --> 02:53:30.479 align:start position:0%
umbrella so I can't imagine there's a
 
02:53:32.269 --> 02:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
code for every single one of those right
 
02:53:32.279 --> 02:53:33.530 align:start position:0%
code for every single one of those right
now

02:53:33.530 --> 02:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:53:37.429 --> 02:53:37.439 align:start position:0%
just know and that 20 um that 20 uh
 
02:53:39.469 --> 02:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
points I think it's nanograms in the in
 
02:53:41.990 --> 02:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
the blood that's total so that that
 
02:53:46.250 --> 02:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:49.070 --> 02:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
okay right I didn't realize that so the
 
02:53:51.769 --> 02:53:51.779 align:start position:0%
other thing is is that this if if I mean
 
02:53:53.450 --> 02:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about women if if a
 
02:53:56.510 --> 02:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
man walks in and he's you know of adult
 
02:53:56.520 --> 02:53:57.590 align:start position:0%
man walks in and he's you know of adult
age

02:53:57.590 --> 02:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
age
 
02:54:00.469 --> 02:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
and is showing High pfas you would
 
02:54:02.330 --> 02:54:02.340 align:start position:0%
typically not start screening him for
 
02:54:04.250 --> 02:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
prostate cancer until he's much older
 
02:54:07.250 --> 02:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
but with this he starts getting screened
 
02:54:07.260 --> 02:54:08.809 align:start position:0%
but with this he starts getting screened
earlier

02:54:08.809 --> 02:54:08.819 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
02:54:11.570 --> 02:54:11.580 align:start position:0%
if you if you're if you're an adult even
 
02:54:13.190 --> 02:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
if you're a child and you have high
 
02:54:15.349 --> 02:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
pfest they have to start scanning your
 
02:54:16.849 --> 02:54:16.859 align:start position:0%
not scanning I don't mean you know
 
02:54:18.830 --> 02:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
Imaging but they have to start looking
 
02:54:21.110 --> 02:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
out for kidney cancer because that's
 
02:54:23.090 --> 02:54:23.100 align:start position:0%
gonna that's gonna pop up well it could
 
02:54:25.730 --> 02:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
pop up eventually
 
02:54:25.740 --> 02:54:28.010 align:start position:0%
pop up eventually
yep

02:54:28.010 --> 02:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:54:31.389 --> 02:54:31.399 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so so this is to put in place
 
02:54:34.790 --> 02:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
screening based on that blood work and
 
02:54:37.429 --> 02:54:37.439 align:start position:0%
and it's to avoid patients like me
 
02:54:39.110 --> 02:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
having to spend hours on the phone
 
02:54:42.230 --> 02:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
trying to justify a surgery with an
 
02:54:44.750 --> 02:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
insurance company because you know it
 
02:54:46.010 --> 02:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the books or it wasn't
 
02:54:46.020 --> 02:54:49.250 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the books or it wasn't
recognized

02:54:49.250 --> 02:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:49.260 --> 02:54:52.490 align:start position:0%
 
insurance

02:54:52.490 --> 02:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:54.290 --> 02:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
it was it was one of the people around
 
02:54:56.990 --> 02:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
me and I hope it wasn't an arrestor no
 
02:55:00.590 --> 02:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
no well it was through my husband's uh I
 
02:55:03.290 --> 02:55:03.300 align:start position:0%
he works for red hat so that's a fairly
 
02:55:05.389 --> 02:55:05.399 align:start position:0%
large business
 
02:55:14.030 --> 02:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:20.990 --> 02:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:26.050 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:55:26.050 --> 02:55:26.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:32.330 --> 02:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:34.250 --> 02:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
I would challenge if they say it's all
 
02:55:36.650 --> 02:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
covered but you can you can hear what
 
02:55:54.710 --> 02:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:59.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:55:59.990 --> 02:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:02.030 --> 02:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
everybody well there are lots of things
 
02:56:21.710 --> 02:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:21.720 --> 02:57:02.950 align:start position:0%
 
committee

02:57:02.950 --> 02:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:06.410 --> 02:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
it said that the last thing we would see
 
02:57:09.290 --> 02:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
over there is a dash k
 
02:57:13.849 --> 02:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
Ash Amy there's an actual appropriation
 
02:57:16.790 --> 02:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
that means you guarantee that the early
 
02:57:23.349 --> 02:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:25.910 --> 02:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the fiscal note on this
 
02:57:33.050 --> 02:57:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:35.090 --> 02:57:35.100 align:start position:0%
so we'll take it up next uh well I
 
02:57:36.530 --> 02:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
actually now that I think about it
 
02:57:38.510 --> 02:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
because it's not an early bill I might
 
02:57:40.849 --> 02:57:40.859 align:start position:0%
push this off till later for us to work
 
02:57:42.849 --> 02:57:42.859 align:start position:0%
on it
 
02:57:42.859 --> 02:57:46.870 align:start position:0%
on it

Londonderry I'm here today to speak to
 
03:40:02.450 --> 03:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you for allowing me to
 
03:40:04.729 --> 03:40:04.739 align:start position:0%
speak to it pfas is a group of chemicals
 
03:40:06.469 --> 03:40:06.479 align:start position:0%
that are tasteless have no smell are
 
03:40:08.630 --> 03:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
invisible making them virtually unknown
 
03:40:11.929 --> 03:40:11.939 align:start position:0%
to the average person pfest chemicals
 
03:40:13.550 --> 03:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
are listed as a forever chemical meaning
 
03:40:15.590 --> 03:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
they never go away
 
03:40:17.690 --> 03:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
pfas is a chemical that according to the

chemical that you don't want to ingest
 
03:40:35.990 --> 03:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
in any quantity
 
03:40:38.750 --> 03:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
no amount of pfast is acceptable
 
03:40:41.030 --> 03:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
pfas affects not only humans but pets
 
03:40:44.809 --> 03:40:44.819 align:start position:0%

Wendy's Chipotle have removed pfast
 
03:40:51.469 --> 03:40:51.479 align:start position:0%
already from their packaging
 
03:40:53.450 --> 03:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
McDonald's Burger King Popeyes have all
 
03:40:55.309 --> 03:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
committed to remove the pfas from their
 
03:40:58.130 --> 03:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
food packaging by 2025.
 
03:41:00.050 --> 03:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
grocery chains such as Trader Joe's
 
03:41:02.450 --> 03:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
Whole Foods are currently using pfast
 
03:41:05.929 --> 03:41:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:07.790 --> 03:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
there should be no tax money spent on
 
03:41:08.750 --> 03:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:41:10.670 --> 03:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
and states that have already passed the
 
03:41:13.130 --> 03:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
ban on pfast and food packaging they put
 
03:41:15.410 --> 03:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
the onus on the manufacturer in order to
 
03:41:18.290 --> 03:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
sell food packaging in these states the
 
03:41:21.889 --> 03:41:21.899 align:start position:0%
manufacturer must comply must provide a
 
03:41:23.330 --> 03:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
certificate of compliance in order to
 
03:41:26.690 --> 03:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
sell their product in that state
 
03:41:28.190 --> 03:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
the incent of this bill is to prevent
 
03:41:30.110 --> 03:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
further exposure to pfas from food
 
03:41:30.120 --> 03:41:31.190 align:start position:0%
further exposure to pfas from food
packaging

03:41:31.190 --> 03:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
packaging
 
03:41:33.889 --> 03:41:33.899 align:start position:0%
by reducing pfas and food packaging we
 
03:41:35.210 --> 03:41:35.220 align:start position:0%
hope to reduce the health costs
 
03:41:36.410 --> 03:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
associated with what this forever
 
03:41:39.349 --> 03:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
chemical causes to People's Health
 
03:41:41.150 --> 03:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
this bill will also remove pfas from
 
03:41:43.070 --> 03:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
food packaging in the waste cycle
 
03:41:44.630 --> 03:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
this will thus reduce the amount of
 
03:41:46.550 --> 03:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
pfast going to landfills thus reducing
 
03:41:48.170 --> 03:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
the amount of pfast that can leach into
 
03:41:49.370 --> 03:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
the groundwater
 
03:41:51.349 --> 03:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
and when it is burned released into the
 
03:41:51.359 --> 03:41:53.330 align:start position:0%
and when it is burned released into the
air

03:41:53.330 --> 03:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
air
 
03:41:55.729 --> 03:41:55.739 align:start position:0%
this bill will also not raise any costs
 
03:41:57.290 --> 03:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
on small business
 
03:41:58.910 --> 03:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
a study was done by the department of
 
03:42:01.250 --> 03:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
ecology and the state of Washington
 
03:42:03.349 --> 03:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
they have identified that there are less
 
03:42:05.269 --> 03:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
hazardous Alternatives that are already
 
03:42:07.010 --> 03:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
available in the market
 
03:42:09.769 --> 03:42:09.779 align:start position:0%
that will cause no Financial impact to
 
03:42:11.330 --> 03:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
any small business or to the average
 
03:42:11.340 --> 03:42:13.130 align:start position:0%
any small business or to the average
consumer

03:42:13.130 --> 03:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
03:42:14.870 --> 03:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
in conclusion Mr chair and committee
 
03:42:17.210 --> 03:42:17.220 align:start position:0%
members pfas is a forever chemical that
 
03:42:18.469 --> 03:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
never goes away
 
03:42:20.150 --> 03:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
we need to limit our exposure to this
 
03:42:22.070 --> 03:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
forever chemical and remove it from all
 
03:42:24.050 --> 03:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
food packaging no amount of this
 
03:42:25.550 --> 03:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
chemical is safe
 
03:42:27.050 --> 03:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill is to put the
 
03:42:28.729 --> 03:42:28.739 align:start position:0%
onus on the manufacturer and not the
 
03:42:28.739 --> 03:42:29.870 align:start position:0%
onus on the manufacturer and not the
taxpayer

03:42:29.870 --> 03:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
03:42:31.729 --> 03:42:31.739 align:start position:0%
this bill is one way we can help keep
 
03:42:33.650 --> 03:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
our citizens and children safe from this
 
03:42:36.170 --> 03:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
forever chemical called pfas
 
03:42:37.729 --> 03:42:37.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and committee for
 
03:42:39.530 --> 03:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
your time today I'm happy to take any
 
03:42:41.809 --> 03:42:41.819 align:start position:0%
questions if there's anything related to
 
03:42:44.030 --> 03:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
health and science there's much smarter
 
03:42:45.530 --> 03:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
people than me sitting behind me that
 
03:42:47.269 --> 03:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
can answer those questions thank you for
 
03:42:49.490 --> 03:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
your time I'll see you next exactly
 
03:42:51.590 --> 03:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
sitting next to me yes thank you and uh
 
03:42:52.969 --> 03:42:52.979 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time representative
 
03:42:54.410 --> 03:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
Thomas would you like to testify and
 
03:42:55.729 --> 03:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
then if if you don't mind both taking
 
03:42:56.990 --> 03:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
questions together then sure sure
 
03:42:59.750 --> 03:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely I'm representative Thomas I
 
03:43:02.690 --> 03:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Merrimack pfas
 
03:43:04.729 --> 03:43:04.739 align:start position:0%
chemical oh and thank you for letting me
 
03:43:06.830 --> 03:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh testify in front of you
 
03:43:08.450 --> 03:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
um pfas chemicals are often called
 
03:43:10.190 --> 03:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
Forever chemicals because they do not
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
break down in the environment pfas are
 
03:43:14.870 --> 03:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
are used in food packaging to prevent
 
03:43:16.910 --> 03:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
grease and water from soaking through
 
03:43:20.090 --> 03:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
food wrappers and beverage cups pfas can
 
03:43:21.830 --> 03:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
also be found in the ink used to print
 
03:43:23.809 --> 03:43:23.819 align:start position:0%
logos and instructions on food
 
03:43:23.819 --> 03:43:25.429 align:start position:0%
logos and instructions on food
containers

03:43:25.429 --> 03:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
containers
 
03:43:27.769 --> 03:43:27.779 align:start position:0%
this raises alarms about the use of
 
03:43:30.530 --> 03:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
these compounds especially in items such
 
03:43:34.250 --> 03:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
as Burger wrappers and salad bowls these
 
03:43:37.790 --> 03:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
these substances directly migrate into
 
03:43:39.769 --> 03:43:39.779 align:start position:0%
the food you eat especially when that
 
03:43:42.590 --> 03:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
food is hot it's especially likely when
 
03:43:47.090 --> 03:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
food is fatty salty or acidic like pizza
 
03:43:49.610 --> 03:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
some research even suggests that pfas
 
03:43:51.410 --> 03:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
levels are higher in people who
 
03:43:53.349 --> 03:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
regularly eat out
 
03:43:56.150 --> 03:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
identifying the exact type of pfas in a
 
03:43:58.370 --> 03:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
product is complex there are more than
 
03:44:00.650 --> 03:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
nine thousand known pfas chemicals yet
 
03:44:03.290 --> 03:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
common testing methods can identify only
 
03:44:04.790 --> 03:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
a couple dozen
 
03:44:07.070 --> 03:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
Consumer Report tested products for
 
03:44:09.229 --> 03:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
their total organic fluorine content
 
03:44:11.809 --> 03:44:11.819 align:start position:0%
which is considered the simplest way to
 
03:44:14.870 --> 03:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
assess a materials total pfest content
 
03:44:17.809 --> 03:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
that's because all pfas contain organic
 
03:44:17.819 --> 03:44:18.830 align:start position:0%
that's because all pfas contain organic
fluorine

03:44:18.830 --> 03:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
fluorine
 
03:44:20.809 --> 03:44:20.819 align:start position:0%
and there are a few other sources of
 
03:44:22.309 --> 03:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
that compound
 
03:44:24.469 --> 03:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
California had banned intentionally
 
03:44:28.309 --> 03:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
adding pfas starting in January 2023
 
03:44:30.769 --> 03:44:30.779 align:start position:0%
paper food packaging must have less than
 
03:44:33.370 --> 03:44:33.380 align:start position:0%
100 parts per million organic fluorine
 
03:44:36.410 --> 03:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
Denmark has settled on a 20 parts per
 
03:44:39.229 --> 03:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
million as their threshold and the
 
03:44:41.929 --> 03:44:41.939 align:start position:0%
consumer reports experts support the 20
 
03:44:43.849 --> 03:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
PPM limit
 
03:44:46.849 --> 03:44:46.859 align:start position:0%
Denmark Maine New York Washington and
 
03:44:49.610 --> 03:44:49.620 align:start position:0%
Vermont have already banned pfest from
 
03:44:52.190 --> 03:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
food packaging while Minnesota New York
 
03:44:55.030 --> 03:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
and Connecticut have purchasing policies
 
03:44:58.849 --> 03:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
bearing packaging with the chemicals
 
03:45:01.729 --> 03:45:01.739 align:start position:0%
California Minnesota and Maryland are
 
03:45:04.370 --> 03:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
concerned are considering phase-out laws
 
03:45:06.710 --> 03:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
and or developing regulations
 
03:45:09.349 --> 03:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
if you go to the CDC website for pfas
 
03:45:10.729 --> 03:45:10.739 align:start position:0%
advice one of the first things they
 
03:45:13.729 --> 03:45:13.739 align:start position:0%
state is to quote stop the source that's
 
03:45:15.769 --> 03:45:15.779 align:start position:0%
easy when you have known products like
 
03:45:18.650 --> 03:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
Glide dental floss or shoe water
 
03:45:21.469 --> 03:45:21.479 align:start position:0%
repellent but it's not easy to do if the
 
03:45:23.450 --> 03:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
chemicals are hidden by businesses in
 
03:45:24.830 --> 03:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
their containers
 
03:45:27.290 --> 03:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
one objection to this is cost to
 
03:45:29.269 --> 03:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
businesses they would need to switch to
 
03:45:31.429 --> 03:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
non-p fast food storage containers but
 
03:45:34.670 --> 03:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
many companies are already doing that
 
03:45:37.250 --> 03:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
McDonald's Wendy's and Whole Food Market
 
03:45:39.710 --> 03:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
are among the at least 15 companies that
 
03:45:41.570 --> 03:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
have announced policies in recent years
 
03:45:44.389 --> 03:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
to phase pfas out of packaging that they
 
03:45:45.710 --> 03:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
use or sell
 
03:45:47.690 --> 03:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
let's also talk about the reaction of
 
03:45:51.110 --> 03:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
the consumer recently simply tropical
 
03:45:53.389 --> 03:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
juice was recalled because it contained
 
03:45:55.130 --> 03:45:55.140 align:start position:0%
too much pfas
 
03:45:58.070 --> 03:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
in a class action suit the plaintiff's
 
03:45:59.630 --> 03:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
third-party testing showed that the
 
03:46:01.910 --> 03:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
presence of multiple pfas in the simply
 
03:46:04.429 --> 03:46:04.439 align:start position:0%
tropical juice included more than 100
 
03:46:07.550 --> 03:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
times the EPA recommended recommended
 
03:46:11.269 --> 03:46:11.279 align:start position:0%
levels of pfoa and pfos I can tell you
 
03:46:13.969 --> 03:46:13.979 align:start position:0%
now that as a consumer a mother and a
 
03:46:16.429 --> 03:46:16.439 align:start position:0%
clean water Advocate simply tropical
 
03:46:19.490 --> 03:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
juice has lost my trust I expect a
 
03:46:21.349 --> 03:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
product to be safe when I purchase it
 
03:46:23.630 --> 03:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
and when it is not when it contains
 
03:46:25.790 --> 03:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
chemicals that can make me sick then
 
03:46:28.790 --> 03:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
that product has lost my respect and my
 
03:46:30.290 --> 03:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
business forever
 
03:46:32.690 --> 03:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:46:34.490 --> 03:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
all right questions from the committee I
 
03:46:36.110 --> 03:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
think I saw representative Spears hand
 
03:46:38.630 --> 03:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
first I was going to ask the question
 
03:46:41.389 --> 03:46:41.399 align:start position:0%
and you may have answered it uh I will
 
03:46:47.630 --> 03:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:50.150 --> 03:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
so anything that repels Greece so the
 
03:46:52.790 --> 03:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
the biggest ones are Burger wrappers and
 
03:46:56.330 --> 03:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
pizza boxes and uh Chipotle Chipotle
 
03:46:59.630 --> 03:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
restaurant had um pfas coated Bowls
 
03:47:01.610 --> 03:47:01.620 align:start position:0%
because they have hot rice that they put
 
03:47:03.170 --> 03:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
into those things
 
03:47:06.769 --> 03:47:06.779 align:start position:0%
the the balls so
 
03:47:10.210 --> 03:47:10.220 align:start position:0%
and representative filo Valley
 
03:47:14.690 --> 03:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:16.550 --> 03:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
how do you intend for this bill to be
 
03:47:19.429 --> 03:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
enforced I see that uh on the second
 
03:47:21.050 --> 03:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
page we have municipalities she'll be
 
03:47:22.490 --> 03:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
the sole Authority
 
03:47:24.110 --> 03:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh but what would happen if a
 
03:47:25.849 --> 03:47:25.859 align:start position:0%
municipality decided to set the fine at
 
03:47:25.859 --> 03:47:28.729 align:start position:0%
municipality decided to set the fine at
zero

03:47:28.729 --> 03:47:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:31.429 --> 03:47:31.439 align:start position:0%
if I could um ask DS to speak to New
 
03:47:33.769 --> 03:47:33.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because they have a plan for
 
03:47:36.710 --> 03:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
that oh okay is it possible so um
 
03:47:39.469 --> 03:47:39.479 align:start position:0%
apparently Des will be up and they'll
 
03:47:42.110 --> 03:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
they'll cover that
 
03:47:44.030 --> 03:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
so we'll hold the question for the next
 
03:47:46.969 --> 03:47:46.979 align:start position:0%
uh test of testimony uh representative
 
03:47:46.979 --> 03:47:48.050 align:start position:0%
uh test of testimony uh representative
purcelli

03:47:48.050 --> 03:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
purcelli
 
03:47:48.060 --> 03:47:50.809 align:start position:0%
purcelli
Porcelli

03:47:50.809 --> 03:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
Porcelli
 
03:47:53.030 --> 03:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:47:56.769 --> 03:47:56.779 align:start position:0%
how are the uh let's see the
 
03:48:01.490 --> 03:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
containers or the um
 
03:48:04.010 --> 03:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
service products are they labeled how
 
03:48:08.690 --> 03:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
would uh food service business no not
 
03:48:11.090 --> 03:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
use a particular supplier because
 
03:48:15.769 --> 03:48:15.779 align:start position:0%
they're high in pfast food packaging
 
03:48:17.990 --> 03:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
um is there would require certificate of
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
compliance I'm sorry we would require a
 
03:48:23.690 --> 03:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:26.030 --> 03:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
certificate of compliance couldn't hear
 
03:48:26.040 --> 03:48:27.410 align:start position:0%
certificate of compliance couldn't hear
that

03:48:27.410 --> 03:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:48:29.630 --> 03:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
for the packaging right so is there
 
03:48:32.870 --> 03:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
something on the package that says no
 
03:48:35.330 --> 03:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
pfas chemicals were used in this package
 
03:48:37.910 --> 03:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
I mean how would I know when I'm buying
 
03:48:40.190 --> 03:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
bowls not to buy them I I think it's
 
03:48:42.710 --> 03:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
simple uh similar to the BPA
 
03:48:45.050 --> 03:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
um you know a couple years ago we we
 
03:48:48.229 --> 03:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
banned BPA and we couldn't it was in
 
03:48:49.729 --> 03:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
baby bottles and all that kind of stuff
 
03:48:51.469 --> 03:48:51.479 align:start position:0%
and so now
 
03:48:51.479 --> 03:48:52.070 align:start position:0%
and so now
um

03:48:52.070 --> 03:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:54.769 --> 03:48:54.779 align:start position:0%
Industries and businesses don't use BPA
 
03:48:57.590 --> 03:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
and they actually say you know no BPA in
 
03:48:59.389 --> 03:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
this product so it would be similar to
 
03:49:02.750 --> 03:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
that whole process
 
03:49:05.750 --> 03:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
has that already been implemented so I
 
03:49:07.729 --> 03:49:07.739 align:start position:0%
know not to buy these particular
 
03:49:10.610 --> 03:49:10.620 align:start position:0%
products the pfas ones yes no it has not
 
03:49:12.769 --> 03:49:12.779 align:start position:0%
that's the problem is we don't know
 
03:49:15.110 --> 03:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
we're getting food containers from these
 
03:49:17.870 --> 03:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
businesses that are coded in pfas and we
 
03:49:19.790 --> 03:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
are not aware of it that's that's the
 
03:49:21.530 --> 03:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
whole reason for this bill
 
03:49:23.330 --> 03:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
so is there going to be some type of
 
03:49:26.570 --> 03:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
notification how you know notification
 
03:49:30.050 --> 03:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
well it would be com compliance
 
03:49:32.330 --> 03:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
um but uh it's his bill
 
03:49:34.490 --> 03:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
it would be compliance and to answer the
 
03:49:36.290 --> 03:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
past question I just pulled it up what
 
03:49:38.570 --> 03:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
we were trying to do is with this bill I
 
03:49:40.429 --> 03:49:40.439 align:start position:0%
I had put an amendment forward leave
 
03:49:41.450 --> 03:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
this committee likes to do their
 
03:49:44.750 --> 03:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
amendments on in in subcommittee so
 
03:49:46.550 --> 03:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
what the amendment would hopefully put
 
03:49:48.650 --> 03:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
forward is that the Northeast Waste
 
03:49:50.750 --> 03:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
Management officials Association would
 
03:49:53.750 --> 03:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
be the group of people that would
 
03:49:58.070 --> 03:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:00.769 --> 03:50:00.779 align:start position:0%
okay uh I'm sorry uh we'll go
 
03:50:03.229 --> 03:50:03.239 align:start position:0%
representative uh Burroughs and then
 
03:50:05.210 --> 03:50:05.220 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh
 
03:50:06.769 --> 03:50:06.779 align:start position:0%
um just before I ask my question I think
 
03:50:08.210 --> 03:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
we would like to see your Amendment the
 
03:50:11.090 --> 03:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
committee would like to see it
 
03:50:12.830 --> 03:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
um the amendment's out there I I don't
 
03:50:15.050 --> 03:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
believe that the chair he when I spoke
 
03:50:16.429 --> 03:50:16.439 align:start position:0%
to the chair he said that you guys do
 
03:50:18.290 --> 03:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
all your amendments in-house
 
03:50:20.570 --> 03:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
the amendment is already there it's it's
 
03:50:22.070 --> 03:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
in the end you can email it to the
 
03:50:23.750 --> 03:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
committee email address okay all right
 
03:50:25.190 --> 03:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
and that would be good Absolutely I'll
 
03:50:26.929 --> 03:50:26.939 align:start position:0%
do that okay but my all right here's my
 
03:50:30.110 --> 03:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
question is that um
 
03:50:32.269 --> 03:50:32.279 align:start position:0%
the um since that you need certification
 
03:50:34.370 --> 03:50:34.380 align:start position:0%
the concern that was placed in the
 
03:50:36.290 --> 03:50:36.300 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that municipalities would
 
03:50:38.630 --> 03:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
have to test right is not a concern so
 
03:50:40.429 --> 03:50:40.439 align:start position:0%
the amendment takes care of the fiscal
 
03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
moment hopefully okay thank you
 
03:50:45.469 --> 03:50:45.479 align:start position:0%
represent the wash
 
03:50:47.750 --> 03:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
in order for this to be truly effective
 
03:50:49.790 --> 03:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
don't you need it to be done at a
 
03:50:51.950 --> 03:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
federal level because otherwise why
 
03:50:55.190 --> 03:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
would companies say any of the you know
 
03:50:57.769 --> 03:50:57.779 align:start position:0%
list what's in you know uh the
 
03:51:00.229 --> 03:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
ingredients or pfas yeah
 
03:51:02.990 --> 03:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
um absolutely and um again I'm working
 
03:51:04.790 --> 03:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
with our federal delegation to try to
 
03:51:06.469 --> 03:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
get that passed as well
 
03:51:08.750 --> 03:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
I mean these These are bills that we're
 
03:51:10.309 --> 03:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
proposing for New Hampshire because we
 
03:51:12.889 --> 03:51:12.899 align:start position:0%
have a significant pfas problem in New
 
03:51:14.870 --> 03:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they should be proposed for
 
03:51:17.210 --> 03:51:17.220 align:start position:0%
the nation Because by the time you find
 
03:51:19.849 --> 03:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
pfas in your water it's too late and
 
03:51:21.710 --> 03:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
pfas has now become a national a
 
03:51:24.830 --> 03:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
national issue so yes it should be a net
 
03:51:27.830 --> 03:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
but until it becomes a national law
 
03:51:30.229 --> 03:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
we've got to protect our residents in
 
03:51:33.530 --> 03:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:36.190 --> 03:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
all right any further questions
 
03:51:38.570 --> 03:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
seeing seeing none thank you both for
 
03:51:50.830 --> 03:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:54.530 --> 03:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
just pass it up on the end there yeah
 
03:51:57.670 --> 03:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
that's no
 
03:52:00.229 --> 03:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:02.030 --> 03:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
all right next we're going to call uh
 
03:52:04.610 --> 03:52:04.620 align:start position:0%
Jody grimbless from American chemistry
 
03:52:04.620 --> 03:52:05.570 align:start position:0%
Jody grimbless from American chemistry
Council

03:52:05.570 --> 03:52:05.580 align:start position:0%
Council
 
03:52:16.510 --> 03:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:18.469 --> 03:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:20.510 --> 03:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Jody gremlis
 
03:52:21.889 --> 03:52:21.899 align:start position:0%
and I'm here representing the American
 
03:52:23.929 --> 03:52:23.939 align:start position:0%
chemistry Council we have concerns about
 
03:52:25.670 --> 03:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
the bill as presented I understand it
 
03:52:27.530 --> 03:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
may be an amendment so we'd obviously
 
03:52:27.540 --> 03:52:28.849 align:start position:0%
may be an amendment so we'd obviously
like

03:52:28.849 --> 03:52:28.859 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:52:28.859 --> 03:52:31.610 align:start position:0%
like
sorry

03:52:31.610 --> 03:52:31.620 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:52:32.990 --> 03:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
um so we'd like to get an opportunity to
 
03:52:35.210 --> 03:52:35.220 align:start position:0%
take a look at that Amendment
 
03:52:37.070 --> 03:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
um the American chemistry council is the
 
03:52:38.750 --> 03:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
national trade Association of chemical
 
03:52:40.910 --> 03:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
and plastic manufacturers including some
 
03:52:42.110 --> 03:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
of our member companies here in New
 
03:52:44.150 --> 03:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire over 96 percent of
 
03:52:46.370 --> 03:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
manufactured goods are are impacted by
 
03:52:48.229 --> 03:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
the business of chemistry so it's kind
 
03:52:49.490 --> 03:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
of an essential part of our nation's
 
03:52:52.490 --> 03:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
economy the chemical industry supports a
 
03:52:55.150 --> 03:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
comprehensive approach to managing pfas
 
03:52:57.410 --> 03:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
and that would help to ensure protection
 
03:52:59.990 --> 03:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
of human health and environment that
 
03:53:01.550 --> 03:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
includes appropriate science-based
 
03:53:04.130 --> 03:53:04.140 align:start position:0%
policies and regulations
 
03:53:06.050 --> 03:53:06.060 align:start position:0%
so one of the things I would note about
 
03:53:09.530 --> 03:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
the bill is that what I understand is
 
03:53:12.349 --> 03:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
that there's significant levels of study
 
03:53:14.690 --> 03:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
science and regulation being done at the
 
03:53:17.570 --> 03:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
FDA so I did bring
 
03:53:17.580 --> 03:53:25.490 align:start position:0%
FDA so I did bring
information

03:53:25.490 --> 03:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:28.190 --> 03:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
for the committee about from the fda's
 
03:53:29.870 --> 03:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
website about questions and answers on
 
03:53:33.050 --> 03:53:33.060 align:start position:0%
pfas and food and also I off also
 
03:53:36.469 --> 03:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
authorize uses of pfas in food contact
 
03:53:39.349 --> 03:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
applications food packaging so again
 
03:53:40.849 --> 03:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
it's being looked at at the national
 
03:53:42.349 --> 03:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
level I think there was a question about
 
03:53:45.650 --> 03:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
should this be a national policy we
 
03:53:47.150 --> 03:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
would agree it would because Patchwork
 
03:53:48.950 --> 03:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
regulations from different states is
 
03:53:52.070 --> 03:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
often hard for the whole Supply food
 
03:53:54.650 --> 03:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
chain but um I would leave this
 
03:53:56.450 --> 03:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
information I'll pass it out as I'm as I
 
03:53:58.729 --> 03:53:58.739 align:start position:0%
finish that you can look at and I will
 
03:54:01.190 --> 03:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
tell you that I did double check the
 
03:54:03.410 --> 03:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
authorized uses of pfas and food contact
 
03:54:06.229 --> 03:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
there are pfas I think as representative
 
03:54:08.150 --> 03:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
post mentioned and one of the other
 
03:54:10.910 --> 03:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
committee hearings pfas is a wide
 
03:54:14.090 --> 03:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
variety of chemicals with different
 
03:54:16.309 --> 03:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
chemical infrastructures different
 
03:54:19.490 --> 03:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
substances they're not all the same so
 
03:54:21.530 --> 03:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
there are some that have been studied by
 
03:54:24.410 --> 03:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
the FDA that are okay and safe for food
 
03:54:26.210 --> 03:54:26.220 align:start position:0%
contact and there are some that are not
 
03:54:29.929 --> 03:54:29.939 align:start position:0%
obviously some of the pfos and pfoas are
 
03:54:33.110 --> 03:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
not so this document explains some of
 
03:54:35.090 --> 03:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
that and so I will leave it with the
 
03:54:37.429 --> 03:54:37.439 align:start position:0%
committee be available for subcommittee
 
03:54:38.330 --> 03:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
and I hopefully be able to bring
 
03:54:40.250 --> 03:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
somebody from the chemistry Council to
 
03:54:41.990 --> 03:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
be actually able to answer the more
 
03:54:44.030 --> 03:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
scientific questions
 
03:54:46.010 --> 03:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
um but I'll leave it at that okay thank
 
03:54:48.290 --> 03:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
you questions representative bellew yes
 
03:54:49.429 --> 03:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:54:52.790 --> 03:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
03:54:54.650 --> 03:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
present The Chemical Company
 
03:54:56.870 --> 03:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
chemical industry chemical yes the
 
03:54:58.309 --> 03:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
American chemistry so is that a conflict
 
03:54:59.870 --> 03:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
of interest
 
03:55:02.630 --> 03:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
testifying on this pfas no because they
 
03:55:04.429 --> 03:55:04.439 align:start position:0%
manufacture it no that's the job of a
 
03:55:07.010 --> 03:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
lobbyist yeah that's what a lobbies does
 
03:55:08.929 --> 03:55:08.939 align:start position:0%
is represents
 
03:55:12.950 --> 03:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
their client interests right no I'm 10 I
 
03:55:14.750 --> 03:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
tend to not
 
03:55:17.030 --> 03:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
believe her testimony because where it's
 
03:55:18.650 --> 03:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
coming from we won't insult the
 
03:55:21.170 --> 03:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
witnesses thank you for not appropriate
 
03:55:23.630 --> 03:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Bros yes this is a
 
03:55:26.210 --> 03:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
would you believe sure and um so would
 
03:55:28.849 --> 03:55:28.859 align:start position:0%
you believe hypothetically we had a
 
03:55:32.269 --> 03:55:32.279 align:start position:0%
botulism in some food supply that comes
 
03:55:34.189 --> 03:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire I don't think we
 
03:55:35.630 --> 03:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
would wait to see what the federal
 
03:55:38.090 --> 03:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
government was doing to address it and I
 
03:55:40.010 --> 03:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
think that this is a really serious
 
03:55:41.750 --> 03:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
health problem and I don't think that we
 
03:55:43.729 --> 03:55:43.739 align:start position:0%
should be waiting to see what the
 
03:55:44.990 --> 03:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
federal government does before we
 
03:55:46.370 --> 03:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
address it here because we have people
 
03:55:49.370 --> 03:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
getting sick and dying in the state I
 
03:55:50.809 --> 03:55:50.819 align:start position:0%
understand I just want to bring forward
 
03:55:52.689 --> 03:55:52.699 align:start position:0%
what they're doing thank you so much
 
03:55:55.010 --> 03:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Spear and then
 
03:55:57.889 --> 03:55:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:00.469 --> 03:56:00.479 align:start position:0%
thank you in line with representative
 
03:56:02.510 --> 03:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
Burroughs was saying we have communities
 
03:56:04.370 --> 03:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
here and my sister lives in one of them
 
03:56:06.530 --> 03:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
and we're soon to be living in one they
 
03:56:08.269 --> 03:56:08.279 align:start position:0%
are literally not allowed to drink the
 
03:56:09.889 --> 03:56:09.899 align:start position:0%
water and they get water delivered to
 
03:56:12.469 --> 03:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
their house from the company that's been
 
03:56:14.570 --> 03:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
polluting all these years
 
03:56:18.290 --> 03:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
and I agree we cannot wait for the
 
03:56:22.010 --> 03:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
federal government and it seems like the
 
03:56:23.570 --> 03:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
chemical industry is being just a little
 
03:56:25.729 --> 03:56:25.739 align:start position:0%
bit Cavalier about the whole thing
 
03:56:28.550 --> 03:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
what are you doing specifically are they
 
03:56:30.110 --> 03:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
doing anything are they just sitting
 
03:56:32.330 --> 03:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
there waiting no I don't think so I
 
03:56:34.610 --> 03:56:34.620 align:start position:0%
can't speak for all all of the and again
 
03:56:36.170 --> 03:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
I think I will bring somebody for the
 
03:56:38.210 --> 03:56:38.220 align:start position:0%
subcommittee from the chemistry Council
 
03:56:39.530 --> 03:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
so they can speak to all of the things
 
03:56:42.110 --> 03:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
that they're doing I know 3M is not a
 
03:56:43.670 --> 03:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
member of the association but I know
 
03:56:45.530 --> 03:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
they have I think recently announced
 
03:56:47.269 --> 03:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
that they're getting rid of all the pfas
 
03:56:49.429 --> 03:56:49.439 align:start position:0%
that they have used in the past
 
03:56:51.290 --> 03:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
um so I think there there's a true
 
03:56:54.349 --> 03:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
recognition that pfas and pfoa and pfas
 
03:56:56.330 --> 03:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
are problems
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
I believe so but I would prefer to have
 
03:56:59.750 --> 03:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
somebody from the council speak to you
 
03:56:59.760 --> 03:57:00.710 align:start position:0%
somebody from the council speak to you
directly

03:57:00.710 --> 03:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
directly
 
03:57:02.929 --> 03:57:02.939 align:start position:0%
but I will definitely put that in my
 
03:57:04.250 --> 03:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
notes to get back to them to do
 
03:57:06.889 --> 03:57:06.899 align:start position:0%
representative McLeary uh thank you uh
 
03:57:08.269 --> 03:57:08.279 align:start position:0%
you mentioned right from the beginning
 
03:57:10.670 --> 03:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
that you had objections as to the way
 
03:57:13.070 --> 03:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
that this is written and again then you
 
03:57:14.689 --> 03:57:14.699 align:start position:0%
refer to maybe it should be a federal
 
03:57:19.250 --> 03:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
law but what specific uh problems with
 
03:57:22.550 --> 03:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
the chemical industry have with uh
 
03:57:25.189 --> 03:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
with this bill so there were a couple of
 
03:57:26.990 --> 03:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
questions that they raised so for
 
03:57:27.000 --> 03:57:28.070 align:start position:0%
questions that they raised so for
example

03:57:28.070 --> 03:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
example
 
03:57:29.450 --> 03:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
um there's some language that's pretty
 
03:57:30.670 --> 03:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
Broad and they were trying to understand
 
03:57:33.050 --> 03:57:33.060 align:start position:0%
typically when they face these kinds of
 
03:57:34.670 --> 03:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
when there are these policies passed in
 
03:57:35.870 --> 03:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
various States they're very very
 
03:57:38.750 --> 03:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
specific so for example
 
03:57:41.750 --> 03:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
um a service product on line 16 talks
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
about means a food container Bowl plate
 
03:57:46.429 --> 03:57:46.439 align:start position:0%
tray carton hot and cold beverage lid or
 
03:57:48.889 --> 03:57:48.899 align:start position:0%
other item they're like what does other
 
03:57:51.469 --> 03:57:51.479 align:start position:0%
item mean and so I think it's just the
 
03:57:54.410 --> 03:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
specificity that would be if the
 
03:57:55.670 --> 03:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
committee decides to move forward with
 
03:57:57.050 --> 03:57:57.060 align:start position:0%
legislation to look at some of that
 
03:57:58.490 --> 03:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
language and be very clear about what
 
03:58:01.309 --> 03:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
you mean it's helpful for all of the
 
03:58:02.870 --> 03:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
levels of the supply chain to the
 
03:58:02.880 --> 03:58:05.150 align:start position:0%
levels of the supply chain to the
consumer

03:58:05.150 --> 03:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
03:58:07.670 --> 03:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative Terry so with respect to
 
03:58:09.229 --> 03:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
your knowledge of the laws that have
 
03:58:11.389 --> 03:58:11.399 align:start position:0%
been passed by other states would you
 
03:58:13.370 --> 03:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
say in general there is a
 
03:58:15.889 --> 03:58:15.899 align:start position:0%
greater level of specificity such that
 
03:58:18.050 --> 03:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
you do yeah the same kinds of concerns
 
03:58:20.030 --> 03:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
that you do with this bill that
 
03:58:23.630 --> 03:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
apparently has not been modeled as I've
 
03:58:25.189 --> 03:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
asked for them to send me I think
 
03:58:26.689 --> 03:58:26.699 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas mentioned Vermont
 
03:58:28.250 --> 03:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
has passed Something New York has passed
 
03:58:29.510 --> 03:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
something so I'm trying to see if I can
 
03:58:31.429 --> 03:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
get those laws to see how different they
 
03:58:35.030 --> 03:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
are okay thank you sure
 
03:58:36.830 --> 03:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh
 
03:58:38.290 --> 03:58:38.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:58:40.550 --> 03:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh would you believe I do have a
 
03:58:42.769 --> 03:58:42.779 align:start position:0%
question but I was a Plastics buyer for
 
03:58:45.950 --> 03:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
Hewlett Packard at one time is your data
 
03:58:48.410 --> 03:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
that you're going to pass out am I
 
03:58:50.030 --> 03:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
correct in hearing what you said that
 
03:58:53.630 --> 03:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
there are some forms of
 
03:58:56.689 --> 03:58:56.699 align:start position:0%
pfas that do not Leach
 
03:59:01.010 --> 03:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
in into uh you know humans as far as
 
03:59:03.349 --> 03:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
they're used for various packaging
 
03:59:05.570 --> 03:59:05.580 align:start position:0%
materials and they do not Leach because
 
03:59:08.090 --> 03:59:08.100 align:start position:0%
having been a Plastics buyer there's
 
03:59:10.130 --> 03:59:10.140 align:start position:0%
lots that's like saying all Plastics is
 
03:59:13.670 --> 03:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
bad it's not I think that there's you're
 
03:59:15.170 --> 03:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
going to provide us with some data that
 
03:59:17.150 --> 03:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
shows correct there are different levels
 
03:59:19.550 --> 03:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
correct acknowledging we do have a
 
03:59:21.710 --> 03:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire but there there
 
03:59:23.689 --> 03:59:23.699 align:start position:0%
are some okay let's keep into questions
 
03:59:26.210 --> 03:59:26.220 align:start position:0%
for the hearing correct I'll just say on
 
03:59:27.769 --> 03:59:27.779 align:start position:0%
this which I will pass out the fourth
 
03:59:30.349 --> 03:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
bullet is paper slash paper board food
 
03:59:33.290 --> 03:59:33.300 align:start position:0%
packaging pfas may be used as grief
 
03:59:35.210 --> 03:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
proofing agents and fast food wrappers
 
03:59:37.309 --> 03:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
microwave popcorn bags take out paper
 
03:59:39.530 --> 03:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
board containers and Pet Food bags to
 
03:59:41.210 --> 03:59:41.220 align:start position:0%
prevent oil and grease from foods from
 
03:59:43.849 --> 03:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
leaking but then it goes on further on
 
03:59:48.349 --> 03:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
to tell you which which pfas
 
03:59:50.809 --> 03:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
letters numbers Etc
 
03:59:52.429 --> 03:59:52.439 align:start position:0%
um is actually the ones that have been
 
03:59:54.830 --> 03:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
proven to be safe
 
03:59:56.929 --> 03:59:56.939 align:start position:0%
all right thank you no further questions
 
03:59:58.729 --> 03:59:58.739 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
03:59:59.570 --> 03:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:00:03.469 --> 04:00:03.479 align:start position:0%
next we'll call Noah graze from the New
 
04:00:06.590 --> 04:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association and yes
 
04:00:11.330 --> 04:00:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:13.370 --> 04:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I know my handwriting
 
04:00:15.229 --> 04:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
is terrible it's nature Grace from the
 
04:00:16.969 --> 04:00:16.979 align:start position:0%
municipal Association I don't believe
 
04:00:18.050 --> 04:00:18.060 align:start position:0%
I've been in front of your committee
 
04:00:20.570 --> 04:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
this year so briefly we are a volunteer
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
membership organization comprised of all
 
04:00:25.490 --> 04:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
234 cities and towns we provide them
 
04:00:27.950 --> 04:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
legal advice Education and Training and
 
04:00:30.469 --> 04:00:30.479 align:start position:0%
of course we come here and Advocate the
 
04:00:32.510 --> 04:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
sole issue that we had with this bill as
 
04:00:35.090 --> 04:00:35.100 align:start position:0%
written is page two lines two and three
 
04:00:36.950 --> 04:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
which gives municipalities the sole
 
04:00:38.510 --> 04:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
authority to regulate Implement and
 
04:00:40.130 --> 04:00:40.140 align:start position:0%
enforce the prohibition on Food Service
 
04:00:42.769 --> 04:00:42.779 align:start position:0%
products containing pfas it's not that
 
04:00:44.150 --> 04:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
04:00:47.150 --> 04:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about the impacts of pfas on
 
04:00:48.889 --> 04:00:48.899 align:start position:0%
on our citizens it just seemed
 
04:00:50.710 --> 04:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
inefficient to have
 
04:00:53.450 --> 04:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh be the ones to
 
04:00:55.010 --> 04:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
regulate that when it's obviously we
 
04:00:56.450 --> 04:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
live in a small state it seemed more
 
04:00:58.150 --> 04:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have a Statewide
 
04:01:01.130 --> 04:01:01.140 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority in talking with the
 
04:01:03.950 --> 04:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor he has uh drafted an
 
04:01:05.570 --> 04:01:05.580 align:start position:0%
amendment that I believe addresses all
 
04:01:07.849 --> 04:01:07.859 align:start position:0%
of our concerns so I would urge the
 
04:01:09.410 --> 04:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
committee to look at that when he
 
04:01:11.510 --> 04:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
provides that to you and that's all I
 
04:01:11.520 --> 04:01:12.290 align:start position:0%
provides that to you and that's all I
have

04:01:12.290 --> 04:01:12.300 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:01:15.410 --> 04:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:17.269 --> 04:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you thank

you your comment
 
04:01:22.130 --> 04:01:22.140 align:start position:0%
and this is the last card I have so if
 
04:01:24.050 --> 04:01:24.060 align:start position:0%
anybody else would like to speak on 242
 
04:01:26.630 --> 04:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
you have to file a pink card
 
04:01:26.640 --> 04:01:27.530 align:start position:0%
you have to file a pink card
um

04:01:27.530 --> 04:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
um

and this is uh Kevin Daigle from the New
 
04:01:33.410 --> 04:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Grocers Association he opposes
 
04:01:47.570 --> 04:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:49.370 --> 04:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
04:01:51.290 --> 04:01:51.300 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record my name
 
04:01:53.510 --> 04:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
is Kevin Daigle and I'm with the New
 
04:01:55.550 --> 04:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Grocers Association
 
04:01:57.769 --> 04:01:57.779 align:start position:0%
uh for those of you not familiar with us
 
04:02:00.349 --> 04:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
we represent both chain and independent
 
04:02:03.050 --> 04:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
Grocery and convenience stores I did
 
04:02:05.330 --> 04:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
pass around some testimony that's coming
 
04:02:07.070 --> 04:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
around so I'll try and keep my comments
 
04:02:08.929 --> 04:02:08.939 align:start position:0%
brief as I know you're trying to stay on
 
04:02:08.939 --> 04:02:09.889 align:start position:0%
brief as I know you're trying to stay on
schedule

04:02:09.889 --> 04:02:09.899 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
04:02:12.410 --> 04:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh while the concerns surrounding pfas
 
04:02:15.170 --> 04:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
is well founded this bill creates some
 
04:02:17.030 --> 04:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
concerns and because of that we appear
 
04:02:18.889 --> 04:02:18.899 align:start position:0%
today in opposition
 
04:02:20.809 --> 04:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
in applying its own requirements for
 
04:02:22.729 --> 04:02:22.739 align:start position:0%
packaging New Hampshire is creating a
 
04:02:25.429 --> 04:02:25.439 align:start position:0%
burden on our businesses one which puts
 
04:02:27.110 --> 04:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
us in the position of policing product
 
04:02:29.090 --> 04:02:29.100 align:start position:0%
packaging while trying to Source
 
04:02:30.769 --> 04:02:30.779 align:start position:0%
manufacturers who are able to comply
 
04:02:32.510 --> 04:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
with the state's restrictions
 
04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
this is something that will prove to be
 
04:02:36.469 --> 04:02:36.479 align:start position:0%
both challenging and costly
 
04:02:39.170 --> 04:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
additionally as I understand it the use
 
04:02:41.330 --> 04:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
of pfas and other chemicals in all food
 
04:02:43.429 --> 04:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
packaging is already regulated at the
 
04:02:46.010 --> 04:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
federal level by the FDA in order to
 
04:02:48.110 --> 04:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that food packaging is safe
 
04:02:51.170 --> 04:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
for its intended use the FDA requires
 
04:02:53.389 --> 04:02:53.399 align:start position:0%
upfront submission of extensive test
 
04:02:55.010 --> 04:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
data and scientific information
 
04:02:57.650 --> 04:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
regarding chemical composition
 
04:03:00.469 --> 04:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
migration levels and toxicity
 
04:03:02.870 --> 04:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
Additionally the FDA can withdraw its
 
04:03:04.550 --> 04:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
approval for a food packaging chemical
 
04:03:05.990 --> 04:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
at any time
 
04:03:08.150 --> 04:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
if available data no longer demonstrate
 
04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
that the substance is safe for its
 
04:03:11.090 --> 04:03:11.100 align:start position:0%
intended use
 
04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
so we feel this is an area that should
 
04:03:14.389 --> 04:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
be addressed on the federal level to
 
04:03:15.590 --> 04:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
ensure we're not dealing with the
 
04:03:17.570 --> 04:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
patchwork of State mandates and
 
04:03:19.849 --> 04:03:19.859 align:start position:0%
additional costs for compliant packaging
 
04:03:22.130 --> 04:03:22.140 align:start position:0%
so for these reasons we ask you to find
 
04:03:25.130 --> 04:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
House Bill 242 in expedient to legislate
 
04:03:27.349 --> 04:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much any
 
04:03:29.389 --> 04:03:29.399 align:start position:0%
questions representative billio thank
 
04:03:31.130 --> 04:03:31.140 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:03:31.140 --> 04:03:32.510 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
question

04:03:32.510 --> 04:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:03:32.520 --> 04:03:35.689 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:03:35.689 --> 04:03:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:37.370 --> 04:03:37.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if you can answer this but
 
04:03:43.370 --> 04:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
the packaging could be labeled in this
 
04:03:46.910 --> 04:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
packaging was made with pfas or has pfas
 
04:03:48.830 --> 04:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
in it is that possible
 
04:03:51.830 --> 04:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it could be
 
04:03:54.469 --> 04:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
um in outside my area of expertise but
 
04:03:56.030 --> 04:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'll do something that I can relate to
 
04:03:58.070 --> 04:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
so years ago
 
04:04:00.710 --> 04:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
um this legislature took up a bill on
 
04:04:04.429 --> 04:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
GMO and it was to have labeling on
 
04:04:05.929 --> 04:04:05.939 align:start position:0%
specific products that were going to be
 
04:04:07.849 --> 04:04:07.859 align:start position:0%
here in the state
 
04:04:09.769 --> 04:04:09.779 align:start position:0%
um the problem is New Hampshire is such
 
04:04:12.170 --> 04:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
a small footprint so for us to dictate
 
04:04:15.650 --> 04:04:15.660 align:start position:0%
to manufacturers that it would have to
 
04:04:18.050 --> 04:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
um vary its labeling just for those
 
04:04:19.550 --> 04:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
items sold in our state we had
 
04:04:21.170 --> 04:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
manufacturers tell us they wouldn't do
 
04:04:22.790 --> 04:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
that so they would actually limit the
 
04:04:23.870 --> 04:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
number of items they would have been
 
04:04:26.389 --> 04:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
able to sell in the state based on that
 
04:04:29.510 --> 04:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
can you do it I'm sure you can the
 
04:04:31.550 --> 04:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
number of states that are involved makes
 
04:04:33.229 --> 04:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
it difficult because we don't have mass
 
04:04:36.410 --> 04:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
production of packaging here within our
 
04:04:38.990 --> 04:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
states so we're we're transporting that
 
04:04:39.000 --> 04:04:43.969 align:start position:0%
states so we're we're transporting that
in

04:04:43.969 --> 04:04:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:46.070 --> 04:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
um if all of the packaging that was sold
 
04:04:47.990 --> 04:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the US was labeled I mean
 
04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
that would make it easier we want a
 
04:04:52.309 --> 04:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
Level Playing Field right so it's
 
04:04:54.229 --> 04:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
difficult whether it's a small member
 
04:04:56.389 --> 04:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
who has you know a couple stores here in
 
04:04:57.410 --> 04:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and a couple in another
 
04:05:01.130 --> 04:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
state or a multi-state larger chain we
 
04:05:02.689 --> 04:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
just want to be able to have the same
 
04:05:05.210 --> 04:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
Dynamics across yeah okay thank you
 
04:05:08.090 --> 04:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:10.370 --> 04:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions
 
04:05:12.650 --> 04:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
representative spear
 
04:05:15.349 --> 04:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
we have a particularly bad problem here
 
04:05:17.030 --> 04:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I'm sure your
 
04:05:19.130 --> 04:05:19.140 align:start position:0%
families are here as well
 
04:05:19.140 --> 04:05:21.349 align:start position:0%
families are here as well
and

04:05:21.349 --> 04:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:24.229 --> 04:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
would you feel that it as a as a
 
04:05:26.929 --> 04:05:26.939 align:start position:0%
community member facing the same health
 
04:05:29.510 --> 04:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
issues that we are not able to drink our
 
04:05:29.520 --> 04:05:30.530 align:start position:0%
issues that we are not able to drink our
water

04:05:30.530 --> 04:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
water
 
04:05:33.410 --> 04:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
not able to trust even the packaging of
 
04:05:34.729 --> 04:05:34.739 align:start position:0%
our food
 
04:05:36.530 --> 04:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:05:40.370 --> 04:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
grocery Association and the members
 
04:05:43.130 --> 04:05:43.140 align:start position:0%
should take some effort just to protect
 
04:05:45.889 --> 04:05:45.899 align:start position:0%
the communities that they live in
 
04:05:48.290 --> 04:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your question
 
04:05:49.910 --> 04:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
um we do take
 
04:05:51.950 --> 04:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
concern with with those in our
 
04:05:53.809 --> 04:05:53.819 align:start position:0%
communities I'm sorry I I'm having
 
04:05:56.389 --> 04:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
trouble hearing sure so we do take
 
04:05:58.429 --> 04:05:58.439 align:start position:0%
concern with those within our
 
04:06:01.070 --> 04:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
communities and surrounding communities
 
04:06:01.080 --> 04:06:01.910 align:start position:0%
communities and surrounding communities
um

04:06:01.910 --> 04:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:04.790 --> 04:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
the leakage and the contamination that
 
04:06:07.610 --> 04:06:07.620 align:start position:0%
you speak of I don't believe comes from
 
04:06:10.910 --> 04:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
the packaging per se it's coming from a
 
04:06:12.830 --> 04:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
leak from a giant chemical processing
 
04:06:16.550 --> 04:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
plant not from the packaging you talked
 
04:06:20.330 --> 04:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
about the packaging not being safe I
 
04:06:22.490 --> 04:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
don't know where that's true because we
 
04:06:24.490 --> 04:06:24.500 align:start position:0%
rely on the FDA on a number of things
 
04:06:28.370 --> 04:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
for its ability to research and stamp
 
04:06:30.410 --> 04:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
its approval and the packaging you're
 
04:06:32.210 --> 04:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
using now is showing that there isn't
 
04:06:35.450 --> 04:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
leaching into your food
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't know if that answers the
 
04:06:38.399 --> 04:06:41.150 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't know if that answers the
question

04:06:41.150 --> 04:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:43.910 --> 04:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative mclear
 
04:06:45.950 --> 04:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that this is a
 
04:06:47.870 --> 04:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
National Organization
 
04:06:50.630 --> 04:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh no where the New Hampshire but but it

you this bill has great value for New
 
04:09:18.050 --> 04:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I participate in several
 
04:09:19.670 --> 04:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
farmers markets to New Hampshire and due
 
04:09:21.769 --> 04:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
to current legislation I'm severely
 
04:09:23.210 --> 04:09:23.220 align:start position:0%
restricted in what I can sell through
 
04:09:26.090 --> 04:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
cottage law freeze dryers have now been
 
04:09:28.910 --> 04:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
available for residential purchase they
 
04:09:30.769 --> 04:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
are quite an investment they are also a
 
04:09:32.570 --> 04:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
very safe way to preserve food for a
 
04:09:34.010 --> 04:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
longer period of time than traditional
 
04:09:36.290 --> 04:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
canning fish dryers are completely
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
automated freeze food before removing
 
04:09:41.570 --> 04:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
moisture via a vacuum pump it often
 
04:09:43.189 --> 04:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
takes over 12 hours the result is
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
produced that his product is safe and
 
04:09:48.530 --> 04:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
shelf stable I like dehydration which
 
04:09:50.450 --> 04:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
leaves moisture that allows bacteria to
 
04:09:53.389 --> 04:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
grow freeze-dried products are dry you
 
04:09:55.070 --> 04:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
may be familiar with freeze-dried
 
04:09:57.550 --> 04:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
products like hiking meals Astronaut
 
04:10:01.070 --> 04:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
Astronaut ice cream or MREs
 
04:10:04.070 --> 04:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
for those who are veterans or no
 
04:10:08.510 --> 04:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
veterans MREs are meals ready to eat
 
04:10:11.389 --> 04:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
um having lived through she rations K
 
04:10:14.090 --> 04:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
rations and MREs I would much prefer the
 
04:10:14.100 --> 04:10:16.030 align:start position:0%
rations and MREs I would much prefer the
MREs

04:10:16.030 --> 04:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
MREs
 
04:10:18.530 --> 04:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
by allowing freeze-dried fruits and
 
04:10:19.969 --> 04:10:19.979 align:start position:0%
vegetables you make a healthy addition
 
04:10:21.410 --> 04:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
available to the citizens of New
 
04:10:23.389 --> 04:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that lasts longer than fresh
 
04:10:25.370 --> 04:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
produce available at farmers markets
 
04:10:28.130 --> 04:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
freeze drying retains more of the
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
nutritional content any other
 
04:10:32.030 --> 04:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
preservation method the end product is
 
04:10:34.610 --> 04:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
safe as anything a person would be able
 
04:10:37.010 --> 04:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
to buy at their local grocery store most
 
04:10:38.389 --> 04:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
people have asked me to sell them
 
04:10:40.490 --> 04:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried fruits and vegetables and I
 
04:10:41.809 --> 04:10:41.819 align:start position:0%
could not do so under the current
 
04:10:44.330 --> 04:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
regulations freeze drying does not allow
 
04:10:46.570 --> 04:10:46.580 align:start position:0%
for growth of
 
04:10:50.929 --> 04:10:50.939 align:start position:0%
clostridium botulinum botulism the
 
04:10:52.729 --> 04:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
primary concern of the currently drafted
 
04:10:55.130 --> 04:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
cottage law removing all moisture also
 
04:10:57.410 --> 04:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
provides prohibits the growth of
 
04:10:59.150 --> 04:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
microorganisms which is the second
 
04:11:01.729 --> 04:11:01.739 align:start position:0%
priority of current legislation majority
 
04:11:04.729 --> 04:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
of U.S states 34 at this time allow for
 
04:11:06.170 --> 04:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
selling a freeze-dried fruits and
 
04:11:08.090 --> 04:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
vegetables under cottage law as health
 
04:11:11.330 --> 04:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
benefits and Grand the men are so great
 
04:11:13.790 --> 04:11:13.800 align:start position:0%

there's a great succinct explanation of
 
04:11:25.309 --> 04:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
the basic process at a certain website
 
04:11:26.750 --> 04:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and
 
04:11:28.070 --> 04:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
consideration Jennifer Houston
 
04:11:30.410 --> 04:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
Springfield New Hampshire as all of you
 
04:11:33.229 --> 04:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
have this and can communicate with her
 
04:11:36.769 --> 04:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
directly she is very fervent about
 
04:11:39.889 --> 04:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
getting this information done to help
 
04:11:41.870 --> 04:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
all the consumers of all the farmers
 
04:11:43.969 --> 04:11:43.979 align:start position:0%
markets in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:11:46.670 --> 04:11:46.680 align:start position:0%

directors at the Dairy Farmers Market
 
04:11:50.349 --> 04:11:50.359 align:start position:0%
which is one of the best in the state
 
04:11:54.830 --> 04:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
and uh I agree with her and I would have
 
04:11:57.769 --> 04:11:57.779 align:start position:0%
much rather had some of that really good
 
04:12:00.349 --> 04:12:00.359 align:start position:0%

Safe standards or in say food food
 
04:12:29.150 --> 04:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
safety issues well the next person to
 
04:12:32.750 --> 04:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
Testament testify is going to be Colleen
 
04:12:35.630 --> 04:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
Smith from food Protection Service okay

04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:12:45.769 --> 04:12:45.779 align:start position:0%

um on the methodology in the end
 
04:12:55.490 --> 04:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
um where it says to the extent that
 
04:12:57.410 --> 04:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
entities are exempt from licensure this
 
04:12:59.330 --> 04:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
bill will result in an indeterminable
 
04:13:01.130 --> 04:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
decrease in Revenue to the state general
 
04:13:06.650 --> 04:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:08.570 --> 04:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
um that's a technical question I believe
 
04:13:13.849 --> 04:13:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:14.990 --> 04:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you very much
 
04:13:16.670 --> 04:13:16.680 align:start position:0%

04:13:20.870 --> 04:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:13:23.389 --> 04:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
we'll call the next uh
 
04:13:28.070 --> 04:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
versus the speak Colleen Smith from DHHS
 
04:13:30.050 --> 04:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
opposes the bill and asks for five
 
04:13:30.060 --> 04:13:40.189 align:start position:0%
opposes the bill and asks for five
minutes

04:13:40.189 --> 04:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:42.050 --> 04:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to testify for
 
04:13:45.830 --> 04:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Colleen Smith I'm
 
04:13:46.969 --> 04:13:46.979 align:start position:0%
the administrator for the food
 
04:13:49.010 --> 04:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
protection section which is within the
 
04:13:50.590 --> 04:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:13:53.809 --> 04:13:53.819 align:start position:0%
the department is opposed to the bill as
 
04:13:57.110 --> 04:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:58.910 --> 04:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
amending the definition of potentially
 
04:14:01.070 --> 04:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
hazardous foods to include
 
04:14:03.410 --> 04:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried fruits and vegetables there
 
04:14:05.809 --> 04:14:05.819 align:start position:0%
there is a conflict there in in the
 
04:14:08.150 --> 04:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
sense that if the freeze drying was done
 
04:14:10.790 --> 04:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
correctly the the product is
 
04:14:13.070 --> 04:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
non-potentially hazardous Our concern
 
04:14:17.150 --> 04:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
lies in the uh the use of Home equipment
 
04:14:20.450 --> 04:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
and consistency of being able to yield a
 
04:14:25.070 --> 04:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
safe product the currently if a producer
 
04:14:28.670 --> 04:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
was going to freeze-dried a product such
 
04:14:30.229 --> 04:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
as fruits or vegetables they would
 
04:14:32.090 --> 04:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
require to get a license in a commercial
 
04:14:34.490 --> 04:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
kitchen and they would also have to have
 
04:14:37.130 --> 04:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
their process evaluated by process
 
04:14:39.590 --> 04:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
Authority usually an education someone
 
04:14:41.750 --> 04:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
from a university to evaluate their
 
04:14:41.760 --> 04:14:43.030 align:start position:0%
from a university to evaluate their
process

04:14:43.030 --> 04:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:14:44.990 --> 04:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
freeze drying fruits and vegetables
 
04:14:47.210 --> 04:14:47.220 align:start position:0%
they're all they're not uniform in shape
 
04:14:50.990 --> 04:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
and size so applying One Step might not
 
04:14:54.050 --> 04:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
yield the same results or same dryness
 
04:14:56.590 --> 04:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
in a product to yield to make it
 
04:14:59.630 --> 04:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
not potentially hazardous
 
04:15:02.389 --> 04:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
with the definition change a homestead
 
04:15:04.429 --> 04:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
food operator could make this in their
 
04:15:06.530 --> 04:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
home there are certain home food
 
04:15:08.630 --> 04:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturers in New Hampshire that do
 
04:15:10.849 --> 04:15:10.859 align:start position:0%
our license but many are exempt from a
 
04:15:13.969 --> 04:15:13.979 align:start position:0%
license because they don't gross more
 
04:15:16.910 --> 04:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
than 35 000 in sales or they're only
 
04:15:19.550 --> 04:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
selling their products from their home a
 
04:15:23.570 --> 04:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
Farm Stand or a farmer's market so those
 
04:15:27.290 --> 04:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
we we don't regulate those entities so
 
04:15:30.469 --> 04:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
we would have no oversight on an exempt
 
04:15:33.650 --> 04:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
Homestead so if this was allowed
 
04:15:35.389 --> 04:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
um they could do this without any kind
 
04:15:37.969 --> 04:15:37.979 align:start position:0%
of regulatory oversight or verification
 
04:15:39.950 --> 04:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
that was there was food safety training
 
04:15:42.469 --> 04:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
by the the operator
 
04:15:45.170 --> 04:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
um we do recognize that home kitchens
 
04:15:47.210 --> 04:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
are limited in size we're concerned that
 
04:15:49.070 --> 04:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
if it was focused on fruits and
 
04:15:51.410 --> 04:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
vegetables that this could overwhelm a
 
04:15:53.210 --> 04:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
home kitchen if they were trying to
 
04:15:55.729 --> 04:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
freeze dry a lot of food at once and
 
04:15:58.729 --> 04:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
using a domestic food that a
 
04:16:00.769 --> 04:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
piece of equipment that was meant for
 
04:16:04.189 --> 04:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
residential use not a commercial use by
 
04:16:07.309 --> 04:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
by altering that product and packaging
 
04:16:09.229 --> 04:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
it you you do
 
04:16:12.530 --> 04:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
um you do limit the amount of growth of
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
spoilage microorganisms and make it more
 
04:16:17.330 --> 04:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
of an environment conducive to pathogens
 
04:16:19.670 --> 04:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
such as salmonella would be one of
 
04:16:21.889 --> 04:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
concern in fact the department did was
 
04:16:23.689 --> 04:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
involved in investigating an outbreak
 
04:16:28.610 --> 04:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
this was a dried jerky dog treat several
 
04:16:31.370 --> 04:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
years ago that sickened 43 people and it
 
04:16:34.010 --> 04:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
was the case where a home food
 
04:16:36.410 --> 04:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and and pet food is is not
 
04:16:37.910 --> 04:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
regulated by the Department of Health
 
04:16:40.010 --> 04:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and in fact this
 
04:16:42.410 --> 04:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
person follow it's it actually follows
 
04:16:44.630 --> 04:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture but based
 
04:16:46.070 --> 04:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
on their rules they had they weren't
 
04:16:48.050 --> 04:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
required to be licensed they were making
 
04:16:51.349 --> 04:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
the jerky with a dehydrator they weren't
 
04:16:53.389 --> 04:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
cooking it properly they weren't
 
04:16:54.830 --> 04:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
cleaning properly they didn't have food
 
04:16:56.929 --> 04:16:56.939 align:start position:0%
safety training and that therefore 43
 
04:16:59.330 --> 04:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
people became ill with salmonella as a
 
04:17:02.990 --> 04:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
result of that product so again we do
 
04:17:04.969 --> 04:17:04.979 align:start position:0%
have concerns with expanding what's
 
04:17:06.889 --> 04:17:06.899 align:start position:0%
allowed in a homestead kitchen currently
 
04:17:08.750 --> 04:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
what's allowed are baked goods such as
 
04:17:11.030 --> 04:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
brownies cookies candies jams jellies
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
things that don't pose a large food
 
04:17:17.750 --> 04:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
safety risk so thank you for allowing me
 
04:17:19.429 --> 04:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
to testify I'd be happy to answer any
 
04:17:22.250 --> 04:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
questions the committee might have
 
04:17:24.410 --> 04:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
I have one question uh
 
04:17:27.830 --> 04:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
under thirty five thousand dollars in
 
04:17:31.010 --> 04:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
sales this would not be necessary is
 
04:17:32.030 --> 04:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
that right
 
04:17:34.670 --> 04:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
correct the homestead food manufacturer
 
04:17:37.130 --> 04:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
who who does not make more than thirty
 
04:17:38.929 --> 04:17:38.939 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars is not required to
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
be licensed but again that that's really
 
04:17:43.370 --> 04:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
um on an honor System we don't track
 
04:17:46.189 --> 04:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
income so someone has to self-report to
 
04:17:48.530 --> 04:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
us we really find that the most times
 
04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
someone's coming us coming to us to be
 
04:17:52.790 --> 04:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
licensed as the homestead is because
 
04:17:54.889 --> 04:17:54.899 align:start position:0%
where they're selling it is requiring it
 
04:17:57.410 --> 04:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
or they want to sell to restaurants or
 
04:17:59.570 --> 04:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
via the Internet those are usually the
 
04:18:01.550 --> 04:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
reasons why
 
04:18:03.410 --> 04:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Sullivan you
 
04:18:06.889 --> 04:18:06.899 align:start position:0%
had to end up uh yeah thank you so
 
04:18:08.689 --> 04:18:08.699 align:start position:0%
how does it work down I think you
 
04:18:09.950 --> 04:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
explained it a little bit so right now
 
04:18:11.929 --> 04:18:11.939 align:start position:0%
you allow like brownie I know there's a
 
04:18:14.269 --> 04:18:14.279 align:start position:0%
woman in Berlin who makes whoopie pies
 
04:18:16.070 --> 04:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
out of her Homestead or her house
 
04:18:18.050 --> 04:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
because it says home kitchen or
 
04:18:19.969 --> 04:18:19.979 align:start position:0%
something on the label so what is the
 
04:18:22.490 --> 04:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework there and why would
 
04:18:24.290 --> 04:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
it not work for this is simply because
 
04:18:25.849 --> 04:18:25.859 align:start position:0%
you don't allow anything that could
 
04:18:27.710 --> 04:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
theoretically make us sick to be cooked
 
04:18:30.290 --> 04:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
or correct so the homestead food
 
04:18:32.570 --> 04:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
operation is limited to things which
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
which are generally shelf stable in
 
04:18:36.889 --> 04:18:36.899 align:start position:0%
nature things like baked goods like
 
04:18:39.290 --> 04:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
cookies or brownies things that you're
 
04:18:42.170 --> 04:18:42.180 align:start position:0%
you um if you if you didn't cook it to
 
04:18:43.969 --> 04:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
the correct temperature it was that
 
04:18:46.250 --> 04:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
you'd the product wouldn't be salable
 
04:18:49.250 --> 04:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
it's by cooking it essentially you're
 
04:18:51.469 --> 04:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
you're you're making the product
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
um taste taste as expected they're very
 
04:18:56.870 --> 04:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
low risk their their water activity is
 
04:18:58.550 --> 04:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
what controls the growth of
 
04:19:00.769 --> 04:19:00.779 align:start position:0%
microorganisms and in those baked goods
 
04:19:02.630 --> 04:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
or things like jams and jellies that are
 
04:19:04.910 --> 04:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
high in sugar there's very low micro
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
right microbial
 
04:19:09.530 --> 04:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
um risk with this freeze drying our
 
04:19:11.630 --> 04:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
concern is it's a specialized process
 
04:19:15.410 --> 04:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
and if it's done correctly it could have
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
a low water activity where it doesn't
 
04:19:20.330 --> 04:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
pose a microbial risk our Our concern is
 
04:19:22.090 --> 04:19:22.100 align:start position:0%
is that there's just so much variation
 
04:19:26.090 --> 04:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
and again we're using domestic equipment
 
04:19:28.490 --> 04:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
not necessarily attended intended for
 
04:19:33.590 --> 04:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
mass production of of food for for
 
04:19:39.170 --> 04:19:39.180 align:start position:0%
um Commerce I see follow-up follow-up so
 
04:19:41.870 --> 04:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
is there is there a regulatory framework
 
04:19:43.550 --> 04:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
that you envision that would allow
 
04:19:45.530 --> 04:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
somebody to work like is there a way to
 
04:19:48.530 --> 04:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
go into a person's home and perhaps
 
04:19:50.929 --> 04:19:50.939 align:start position:0%
inspect their dehydrator big yes this
 
04:19:53.210 --> 04:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
would work or is it is that just too
 
04:19:57.110 --> 04:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
complicated so if that if um there could
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
be potentially a a structure where a
 
04:20:02.450 --> 04:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
license could be required for for that
 
04:20:04.849 --> 04:20:04.859 align:start position:0%
and again they would have to have their
 
04:20:07.370 --> 04:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
process evaluated by an authority that
 
04:20:10.849 --> 04:20:10.859 align:start position:0%
was qualified to do that and and you
 
04:20:12.469 --> 04:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
know that specific product whether it
 
04:20:14.990 --> 04:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
was zucchini or blueberries or or apples
 
04:20:16.729 --> 04:20:16.739 align:start position:0%
depending on what they were doing is
 
04:20:19.729 --> 04:20:19.739 align:start position:0%
that the product would be evaluated per
 
04:20:21.469 --> 04:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
that product there is a current
 
04:20:23.929 --> 04:20:23.939 align:start position:0%
mechanism for them to to do that now but
 
04:20:25.250 --> 04:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
it would be have to be in a commercial
 
04:20:27.590 --> 04:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
kitchen a commercial setting versus a
 
04:20:29.210 --> 04:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
home kitchen
 
04:20:32.269 --> 04:20:32.279 align:start position:0%
I see thank you okay we're gonna go uh
 
04:20:33.769 --> 04:20:33.779 align:start position:0%
representative Calabro representative
 
04:20:37.010 --> 04:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
McAleer representative Gibbs and
 
04:20:40.429 --> 04:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:41.870 --> 04:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Vice
 
04:20:41.880 --> 04:20:42.769 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Vice
chair

04:20:42.769 --> 04:20:42.779 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:20:42.779 --> 04:20:43.849 align:start position:0%
chair
um

04:20:43.849 --> 04:20:43.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:45.710 --> 04:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
as a retired Chef
 
04:20:45.720 --> 04:20:47.090 align:start position:0%
as a retired Chef
um

04:20:47.090 --> 04:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:51.110 --> 04:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
I think that the spirit of this bill was
 
04:20:53.689 --> 04:20:53.699 align:start position:0%
to make life easier for homesteads to be
 
04:20:54.889 --> 04:20:54.899 align:start position:0%
able to sell
 
04:20:57.290 --> 04:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
um what I would consider to be fairly
 
04:20:58.790 --> 04:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
safe innocuous things you were
 
04:21:00.830 --> 04:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
mentioning meat and and meat related
 
04:21:05.150 --> 04:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:09.349 --> 04:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
um as a culinarian certified
 
04:21:12.349 --> 04:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
um when somebody is doing something in
 
04:21:13.849 --> 04:21:13.859 align:start position:0%
an operation like this the last thing
 
04:21:15.229 --> 04:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
they want to do is get somebody sick
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
okay so freeze drying really is the
 
04:21:20.990 --> 04:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
safest method of preservation for that
 
04:21:24.530 --> 04:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
particular thing my question to you is
 
04:21:24.540 --> 04:21:27.110 align:start position:0%
particular thing my question to you is
um

04:21:27.110 --> 04:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:30.290 --> 04:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:34.010 --> 04:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
if we Outlaw this and it is safe
 
04:21:36.889 --> 04:21:36.899 align:start position:0%
this is kind of hampering that
 
04:21:36.899 --> 04:21:37.550 align:start position:0%
this is kind of hampering that
um

04:21:37.550 --> 04:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:40.550 --> 04:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
that whole thing what do you think we
 
04:21:43.790 --> 04:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:45.830 --> 04:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
learn more about the process it's doing
 
04:21:48.410 --> 04:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
at home so that we can say this is safe
 
04:21:51.229 --> 04:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
I mean it's federally controlled they
 
04:21:53.090 --> 04:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
they have
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
um they won't allow these things to be
 
04:22:00.110 --> 04:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:02.990 --> 04:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
so so uh and to answer your question we
 
04:22:05.210 --> 04:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
did we did consult with University
 
04:22:07.370 --> 04:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
officials at the University of Maine and
 
04:22:10.250 --> 04:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
at Cornell and they they're they were in
 
04:22:11.929 --> 04:22:11.939 align:start position:0%
agreement that
 
04:22:14.389 --> 04:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
in order to be verified that it's being
 
04:22:16.429 --> 04:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
done safely is that it which should have
 
04:22:18.830 --> 04:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
a process review which would be they
 
04:22:21.950 --> 04:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
would evaluate based on the the size and
 
04:22:24.830 --> 04:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
the specific Matrix the times and the
 
04:22:27.050 --> 04:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
times and length that it would be in the
 
04:22:29.929 --> 04:22:29.939 align:start position:0%
freeze dryer to have some food safety
 
04:22:33.110 --> 04:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
controls Our concern is is that there
 
04:22:36.229 --> 04:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
are a very large group of homesteaders
 
04:22:39.530 --> 04:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
that are without regulatory oversight so
 
04:22:41.689 --> 04:22:41.699 align:start position:0%
how could we possibly manage that they
 
04:22:43.490 --> 04:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
were actually going to get that that
 
04:22:43.500 --> 04:22:45.830 align:start position:0%
were actually going to get that that
done

04:22:45.830 --> 04:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:22:47.809 --> 04:22:47.819 align:start position:0%
all right before we go to representative
 
04:22:50.389 --> 04:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
McAleer uh someone said please send out
 
04:22:52.130 --> 04:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet if you would like to
 
04:22:53.750 --> 04:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
speak on House Bill 280 please fill out
 
04:22:55.969 --> 04:22:55.979 align:start position:0%
a pink card uh and this will be the last
 
04:22:58.070 --> 04:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
speaker otherwise representative uh
 
04:23:00.110 --> 04:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:23:02.210 --> 04:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
um is there anything that can be done in
 
04:23:03.889 --> 04:23:03.899 align:start position:0%
this bill you said you consulted with
 
04:23:06.229 --> 04:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
Cornell and University of Maine and plus
 
04:23:09.530 --> 04:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
the DHS is there anything you think you
 
04:23:11.510 --> 04:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
folks could could do to this bill
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
recommendations that would make it uh
 
04:23:13.439 --> 04:23:15.110 align:start position:0%
recommendations that would make it uh
passable

04:23:15.110 --> 04:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
passable
 
04:23:18.229 --> 04:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
so I would say at the minimum we would
 
04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
want these this group of producers to at
 
04:23:25.130 --> 04:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
least have our have a food license so
 
04:23:26.809 --> 04:23:26.819 align:start position:0%
then we could work with them to make
 
04:23:28.729 --> 04:23:28.739 align:start position:0%
sure that they were getting those proper
 
04:23:31.550 --> 04:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
evalu the proper evaluations done by an
 
04:23:33.889 --> 04:23:33.899 align:start position:0%
authority to to to understand that they
 
04:23:36.710 --> 04:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
could yield a safe product in the end as
 
04:23:39.349 --> 04:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
I said before is that freeze drying if
 
04:23:40.969 --> 04:23:40.979 align:start position:0%
done correctly could yield a safe
 
04:23:44.030 --> 04:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
product it's just without any regulatory
 
04:23:47.450 --> 04:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
oversight we have there's no there's no
 
04:23:50.750 --> 04:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
certainty that that that home food
 
04:23:53.330 --> 04:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
producer has the equipment or knowledge
 
04:23:55.429 --> 04:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're producing a
 
04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
safe product just just to follow up well
 
04:23:59.689 --> 04:23:59.699 align:start position:0%
could you folks come up with something
 
04:24:03.290 --> 04:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
that meets those uh requirements
 
04:24:05.090 --> 04:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
certified kitchen
 
04:24:08.030 --> 04:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
we we would be open to to having a
 
04:24:10.790 --> 04:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
further Dialogue on that yes thank you
 
04:24:14.090 --> 04:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you
 
04:24:16.550 --> 04:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
um just for clarification
 
04:24:19.130 --> 04:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
um you reference an instance where
 
04:24:22.910 --> 04:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
someone made dog treats from meat and a
 
04:24:25.370 --> 04:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
bunch of people ate the dog treats and
 
04:24:28.550 --> 04:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
got sick did I understand that correctly
 
04:24:32.269 --> 04:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
no well I'm so yes that that happened
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
but what usually the um the mechanism
 
04:24:37.429 --> 04:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
for them to get sick is that they are
 
04:24:39.469 --> 04:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
they're handling that dog treat that had
 
04:24:41.210 --> 04:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
that was contaminated with salmonella
 
04:24:42.950 --> 04:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then they're not washing their hands
 
04:24:45.229 --> 04:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
before they go and maybe grab grab a
 
04:24:48.349 --> 04:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
cookie or a bag of chips and and we we
 
04:24:50.870 --> 04:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
actually had an instance where there was
 
04:24:52.790 --> 04:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
a a baby that was probably crawling on
 
04:24:54.469 --> 04:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
the floor or the same time where the
 
04:24:56.809 --> 04:24:56.819 align:start position:0%
animal was also because and also if the
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
animal was sick then the owner is
 
04:25:00.349 --> 04:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
cleaning up after that animal which also
 
04:25:02.269 --> 04:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
could contaminate their hands so okay
 
04:25:05.809 --> 04:25:05.819 align:start position:0%
they weren't eating the dog treats
 
04:25:10.189 --> 04:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
okay follow up follow-up man uh
 
04:25:11.630 --> 04:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:25:14.870 --> 04:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
you said I think 73 people got sick it
 
04:25:17.929 --> 04:25:17.939 align:start position:0%
was 43. for sorry so 43 people got sick
 
04:25:21.110 --> 04:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
from handling or or from cleaning up
 
04:25:24.170 --> 04:25:24.180 align:start position:0%
after the pet that ate the contaminated
 
04:25:27.710 --> 04:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
dog treats yes thank you
 
04:25:29.870 --> 04:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further questions uh
 
04:25:34.309 --> 04:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:37.550 --> 04:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
could you fill out a pink card okay
 
04:25:40.729 --> 04:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
and the blue sheet uh we had one in
 
04:25:43.910 --> 04:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
favor uh signing in on the blue sheet so
 
04:25:46.070 --> 04:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
with that we'll close the hearing on
 
04:26:45.889 --> 04:26:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:47.929 --> 04:26:47.939 align:start position:0%
okay the next bill we're going to hear
 
04:26:51.290 --> 04:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
is House Bill 645 FN relative to the
 
04:26:51.300 --> 04:26:52.849 align:start position:0%
is House Bill 645 FN relative to the
establishment

04:26:52.849 --> 04:26:52.859 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
04:26:55.250 --> 04:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:26:57.110 --> 04:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
relative to the establishment of
 
04:27:00.649 --> 04:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
decentralized autonomous organizations
 
04:27:03.170 --> 04:27:03.180 align:start position:0%
as legal entities within the state other
 
04:27:05.990 --> 04:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
than otherwise known as daos
 
04:27:09.889 --> 04:27:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:12.530 --> 04:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
the way for representative Ammon to
 
04:27:24.170 --> 04:27:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:24.180 --> 04:27:33.530 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:27:33.530 --> 04:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:36.110 --> 04:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you committee members for
 
04:27:38.809 --> 04:27:38.819 align:start position:0%
listening to my testimony
 
04:27:44.030 --> 04:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 645 uh is relative
 
04:27:46.330 --> 04:27:46.340 align:start position:0%
to something called distributed
 
04:27:49.070 --> 04:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
autonomous or decentralized autonomous
 
04:27:49.080 --> 04:27:51.229 align:start position:0%
autonomous or decentralized autonomous
organizations

04:27:51.229 --> 04:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
04:27:52.969 --> 04:27:52.979 align:start position:0%
and I'll try to explain briefly what
 
04:27:54.710 --> 04:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:28:02.330 --> 04:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:04.790 --> 04:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
so we're all familiar with corporations
 
04:28:07.250 --> 04:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
we have different opinions about their
 
04:28:09.670 --> 04:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
usefulness in society
 
04:28:12.590 --> 04:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
corporations allow for Collective action
 
04:28:16.070 --> 04:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
so people pull together decision making
 
04:28:18.290 --> 04:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
they pull together capital and they
 
04:28:20.570 --> 04:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
build things sometimes that individuals
 
04:28:22.849 --> 04:28:22.859 align:start position:0%
can't accomplish on their own think of a
 
04:28:22.859 --> 04:28:24.170 align:start position:0%
can't accomplish on their own think of a
hotel

04:28:24.170 --> 04:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
hotel
 
04:28:27.530 --> 04:28:27.540 align:start position:0%
or a cruise liner or an airplane and an
 
04:28:31.189 --> 04:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
airliner these require Collective action
 
04:28:35.630 --> 04:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
and corporations are granted
 
04:28:39.050 --> 04:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of immunity from the
 
04:28:41.149 --> 04:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
government the government has
 
04:28:44.450 --> 04:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
something called sovereign immunity
 
04:28:47.750 --> 04:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
and for a fee and for some requirements
 
04:28:49.149 --> 04:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
the government
 
04:28:52.070 --> 04:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
franchises that sovereign immunity to a
 
04:28:52.080 --> 04:28:53.630 align:start position:0%
franchises that sovereign immunity to a
corporation

04:28:53.630 --> 04:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
corporation
 
04:28:56.570 --> 04:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
and the corporation is is granted
 
04:29:00.050 --> 04:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
something called Legal personhood
 
04:29:02.929 --> 04:29:02.939 align:start position:0%
and its members are shielded from
 
04:29:04.490 --> 04:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
liability much
 
04:29:06.530 --> 04:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
as we're all shielded from liability for
 
04:29:08.389 --> 04:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
the decisions that we make as part of
 
04:29:09.309 --> 04:29:09.319 align:start position:0%
the government
 
04:29:11.450 --> 04:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
corporate officers are shielded from
 
04:29:13.189 --> 04:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
liability it's part of the bargain
 
04:29:13.199 --> 04:29:14.809 align:start position:0%
liability it's part of the bargain
between

04:29:14.809 --> 04:29:14.819 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:29:17.450 --> 04:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
the government and corporations and so
 
04:29:19.729 --> 04:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
corporate structures are have been
 
04:29:22.070 --> 04:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
around a very long time
 
04:29:25.070 --> 04:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
so with that in the back of your mind
 
04:29:25.080 --> 04:29:26.889 align:start position:0%
so with that in the back of your mind
um

04:29:26.889 --> 04:29:26.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:29.929 --> 04:29:29.939 align:start position:0%
with blockchain technology which we've
 
04:29:31.250 --> 04:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
been talking about in this committee for
 
04:29:32.450 --> 04:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
a little while
 
04:29:35.990 --> 04:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
um it's created these new tools
 
04:29:38.689 --> 04:29:38.699 align:start position:0%
building blocks if you will
 
04:29:42.050 --> 04:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
that allow for new kinds of collective
 
04:29:42.060 --> 04:29:43.729 align:start position:0%
that allow for new kinds of collective
organization

04:29:43.729 --> 04:29:43.739 align:start position:0%
organization
 
04:29:46.250 --> 04:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
and the name that sort of the
 
04:29:48.769 --> 04:29:48.779 align:start position:0%
technologists and the uh
 
04:29:50.689 --> 04:29:50.699 align:start position:0%
you know the people involved in this
 
04:29:54.290 --> 04:29:54.300 align:start position:0%
have settled on is a Dao a Dao it sounds
 
04:29:57.790 --> 04:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
sort of like a maybe a Buddhist uh
 
04:30:00.110 --> 04:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
chant but
 
04:30:04.910 --> 04:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
or oh no that would be DOA yeah yeah Not
 
04:30:07.189 --> 04:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
Dead on Arrival representative
 
04:30:07.199 --> 04:30:09.010 align:start position:0%
Dead on Arrival representative
foreign

04:30:09.010 --> 04:30:09.020 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:30:11.870 --> 04:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
and so it's enabled new kinds of
 
04:30:13.729 --> 04:30:13.739 align:start position:0%
structures uh that are similar to
 
04:30:15.349 --> 04:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
corporate structures
 
04:30:17.809 --> 04:30:17.819 align:start position:0%
um they make decisions the way corporate
 
04:30:19.250 --> 04:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
corporations do
 
04:30:22.070 --> 04:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
they uh pull resources the way corporate
 
04:30:24.050 --> 04:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
corporations do
 
04:30:26.090 --> 04:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
but the decision making is much more
 
04:30:30.590 --> 04:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
democratic it's much more decentralized
 
04:30:33.469 --> 04:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's made by it's a sort of like
 
04:30:35.510 --> 04:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with crowdfunding or
 
04:30:38.090 --> 04:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
crowdsourcing so normally you need a
 
04:30:39.950 --> 04:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
centralized website where people put
 
04:30:41.630 --> 04:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
their donations to and there's a there's
 
04:30:43.370 --> 04:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
a purpose behind those donations maybe
 
04:30:45.950 --> 04:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
somebody's hospital bill
 
04:30:48.649 --> 04:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
um but the website itself is centralized
 
04:30:52.250 --> 04:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
it's one website maybe on one server
 
04:30:56.630 --> 04:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
and so a dow is kind of similar in uh in
 
04:30:59.870 --> 04:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
structure but the website itself is is a
 
04:31:01.910 --> 04:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
decentralized protocol
 
04:31:03.410 --> 04:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
and I know that's that sounds a little
 
04:31:08.149 --> 04:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
bit mystical but this is enabled by the
 
04:31:09.889 --> 04:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that you can do with
 
04:31:12.229 --> 04:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
blockchain technology
 
04:31:14.570 --> 04:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to keep this fairly simple
 
04:31:16.370 --> 04:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
and not get into the weeds because it
 
04:31:18.469 --> 04:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
can be very complicated but one of the
 
04:31:19.790 --> 04:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
things that blockchain technology
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
enables is something called a smart
 
04:31:21.600 --> 04:31:23.269 align:start position:0%
enables is something called a smart
contract

04:31:23.269 --> 04:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
contract
 
04:31:25.670 --> 04:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
so think of a smart contract sort of
 
04:31:27.649 --> 04:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
like a vending machine so you put your
 
04:31:29.870 --> 04:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
quarter in now it's probably two dollars
 
04:31:31.729 --> 04:31:31.739 align:start position:0%
of quarters in and you get your
 
04:31:33.590 --> 04:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
Coca-Cola out right so the vending
 
04:31:36.830 --> 04:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
machine it takes it takes value in and
 
04:31:38.809 --> 04:31:38.819 align:start position:0%
you get something of value out and
 
04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
there's you know the little arm that
 
04:31:42.170 --> 04:31:42.180 align:start position:0%
reaches for the soda and it brings it
 
04:31:43.610 --> 04:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
over it drops it in right there's a
 
04:31:45.229 --> 04:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
mechanism inside
 
04:31:47.210 --> 04:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
so a smart contract is like that it's
 
04:31:50.689 --> 04:31:50.699 align:start position:0%
it's code that receives value in this
 
04:31:54.110 --> 04:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
case it's some kind of tokenized value a
 
04:31:56.149 --> 04:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
token could be a cryptocurrency it could
 
04:31:56.159 --> 04:31:56.950 align:start position:0%
token could be a cryptocurrency it could
be

04:31:56.950 --> 04:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:32:00.050 --> 04:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
a token that represents something else
 
04:32:03.349 --> 04:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
and the computer code does something and
 
04:32:07.010 --> 04:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
then out comes uh a decision on on what
 
04:32:07.849 --> 04:32:07.859 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:32:09.530 --> 04:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
and that code
 
04:32:12.110 --> 04:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
and this is a key concept that code is
 
04:32:16.130 --> 04:32:16.140 align:start position:0%
open source publicly available it's on a
 
04:32:18.889 --> 04:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
blockchain and anybody can see it
 
04:32:21.410 --> 04:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
anybody can read what that code does and
 
04:32:22.849 --> 04:32:22.859 align:start position:0%
if you're familiar with how code works
 
04:32:24.590 --> 04:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
you can validate that the code works
 
04:32:24.600 --> 04:32:26.210 align:start position:0%
you can validate that the code works
correctly

04:32:26.210 --> 04:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
04:32:29.330 --> 04:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
so in an old-fashioned Corporation the
 
04:32:31.610 --> 04:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
decisions are made in a boardroom
 
04:32:34.189 --> 04:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
uh and maybe the shareholders don't
 
04:32:36.110 --> 04:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
exactly know what decisions are being
 
04:32:37.849 --> 04:32:37.859 align:start position:0%
made and why
 
04:32:40.309 --> 04:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
but in this new type of structure the
 
04:32:42.530 --> 04:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
decision making is all out in the open
 
04:32:44.750 --> 04:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
and it's not just a secret board it's
 
04:32:46.550 --> 04:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
the community of people that have
 
04:32:49.670 --> 04:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
ownership they they've bought into this
 
04:32:52.610 --> 04:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
Corporation or this this structure
 
04:32:56.929 --> 04:32:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:58.910 --> 04:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
I think I'm losing some of my audience
 
04:33:02.389 --> 04:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:06.230 --> 04:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
um so so in summary a decentralized it's
 
04:33:08.390 --> 04:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
decentralized it's democratized you can
 
04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
think of it that way lots of people it's
 
04:33:14.090 --> 04:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
autonomous means it runs in code and not
 
04:33:16.131 --> 04:33:16.141 align:start position:0%
in a legal document or in a board room
 
04:33:18.189 --> 04:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
the decisions are made in code
 
04:33:21.051 --> 04:33:21.061 align:start position:0%
autonomous and it's an organization it's
 
04:33:23.390 --> 04:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
Collective action of people that's where
 
04:33:25.010 --> 04:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
the name comes from
 
04:33:28.789 --> 04:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
and uh it operates transparently it has
 
04:33:31.250 --> 04:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
a more equitable distribution of power
 
04:33:32.449 --> 04:33:32.459 align:start position:0%
and wealth
 
04:33:34.609 --> 04:33:34.619 align:start position:0%
is typically less regulated compared to
 
04:33:36.650 --> 04:33:36.660 align:start position:0%
traditional corporations
 
04:33:38.631 --> 04:33:38.641 align:start position:0%
and it's different in terms of
 
04:33:40.510 --> 04:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
governance ownership control
 
04:33:44.390 --> 04:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
transparency and compliance requirements
 
04:33:46.490 --> 04:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of my primer on the topic
 
04:33:48.470 --> 04:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about now I'll get to
 
04:33:49.910 --> 04:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
the specific bill
 
04:33:52.429 --> 04:33:52.439 align:start position:0%
House Bill 645
 
04:33:54.709 --> 04:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
we had the governor's cryptocurrency
 
04:33:57.051 --> 04:33:57.061 align:start position:0%
commission it met almost over a full
 
04:33:59.330 --> 04:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
year and I have a copy of the report in
 
04:34:02.209 --> 04:34:02.219 align:start position:0%
front of me it's about 60 pages
 
04:34:04.551 --> 04:34:04.561 align:start position:0%
and through those discussions all the
 
04:34:06.849 --> 04:34:06.859 align:start position:0%
various members that were involved
 
04:34:09.769 --> 04:34:09.779 align:start position:0%
one of the recommendations
 
04:34:13.070 --> 04:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
it's actually the first recommendation
 
04:34:14.990 --> 04:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
and if you download this yourself it's
 
04:34:17.869 --> 04:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
on page 30 of the report
 
04:34:20.209 --> 04:34:20.219 align:start position:0%
recommendations for Change and the very
 
04:34:22.429 --> 04:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
first one is enact a state legal
 
04:34:23.631 --> 04:34:23.641 align:start position:0%
Enterprise law
 
04:34:25.730 --> 04:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
for decentralized autonomous
 
04:34:28.929 --> 04:34:28.939 align:start position:0%
organizations to provide transparency
 
04:34:32.330 --> 04:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
limited liability and legal status to
 
04:34:34.189 --> 04:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
blockchain networks so that's the first
 
04:34:36.410 --> 04:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
and there's a you can read the the
 
04:34:39.289 --> 04:34:39.299 align:start position:0%
description of why that idea might be a
 
04:34:40.849 --> 04:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
04:34:44.390 --> 04:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
so is it is this a new idea
 
04:34:45.890 --> 04:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
have any other states tried this before
 
04:34:48.230 --> 04:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
I know that's going to be a question
 
04:34:50.349 --> 04:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
in July of 2018
 
04:34:53.769 --> 04:34:53.779 align:start position:0%
the very first state to enact a law
 
04:34:56.209 --> 04:34:56.219 align:start position:0%
touching on the subject area
 
04:34:58.910 --> 04:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
was the state of Vermont which is right
 
04:35:00.051 --> 04:35:00.061 align:start position:0%
next door
 
04:35:02.570 --> 04:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
they were the first state to enact
 
04:35:06.949 --> 04:35:06.959 align:start position:0%
LLC legislation so the old traditional
 
04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:10.561 align:start position:0%
style of LLC and tried to tailor some of
 
04:35:13.131 --> 04:35:13.141 align:start position:0%
it to blockchain based companies which
 
04:35:14.750 --> 04:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
the Dow would be a blockchain based
 
04:35:14.760 --> 04:35:16.131 align:start position:0%
the Dow would be a blockchain based
company

04:35:16.131 --> 04:35:16.141 align:start position:0%
company
 
04:35:20.029 --> 04:35:20.039 align:start position:0%
so 2018 Vermont 2021 Wyoming
 
04:35:22.189 --> 04:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
they enacted the first law
 
04:35:26.090 --> 04:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
to mention Dallas so 2021 Wyoming
 
04:35:28.490 --> 04:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
I looked today in their their business
 
04:35:31.910 --> 04:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
registry there are 806 businesses with
 
04:35:35.269 --> 04:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
the word Dao in the name uh as of today
 
04:35:37.910 --> 04:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
and I had looked in December of last
 
04:35:37.920 --> 04:35:39.051 align:start position:0%
and I had looked in December of last
year

04:35:39.051 --> 04:35:39.061 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:35:42.230 --> 04:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
just a month or so ago so it's up from
 
04:35:47.150 --> 04:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
660 to now 806. uh that increase in over
 
04:35:48.709 --> 04:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
just one month
 
04:35:51.650 --> 04:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
and so each filing has a filing fee
 
04:35:53.330 --> 04:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
associated with it so the state collects
 
04:35:56.090 --> 04:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
some funds based on the filing fees and
 
04:35:59.269 --> 04:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
then most recently in April of 2022 last
 
04:36:02.090 --> 04:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
year Tennessee passed a law
 
04:36:05.810 --> 04:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
that mimics what Wyoming passed so
 
04:36:07.490 --> 04:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's three states that have passed
 
04:36:09.769 --> 04:36:09.779 align:start position:0%
laws that are touching on the subject
 
04:36:09.779 --> 04:36:10.490 align:start position:0%
laws that are touching on the subject
area

04:36:10.490 --> 04:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
area
 
04:36:12.590 --> 04:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
now there's criticism of all the laws
 
04:36:14.170 --> 04:36:14.180 align:start position:0%
that have been passed so far
 
04:36:16.849 --> 04:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
that they don't respect the actual
 
04:36:18.830 --> 04:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
nature of how a Dao operates they're
 
04:36:20.990 --> 04:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
trying to take a square peg and put it
 
04:36:23.029 --> 04:36:23.039 align:start position:0%
into a round hole trying to take the new
 
04:36:25.250 --> 04:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
way of doing things forcing it into the
 
04:36:27.529 --> 04:36:27.539 align:start position:0%
old way of doing things too much
 
04:36:29.570 --> 04:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
and so the criticisms
 
04:36:29.580 --> 04:36:30.650 align:start position:0%
and so the criticisms
um

04:36:30.650 --> 04:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:33.289 --> 04:36:33.299 align:start position:0%
are part of the consideration for House
 
04:36:35.449 --> 04:36:35.459 align:start position:0%
Bill 645 we want to do it better than
 
04:36:38.090 --> 04:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
the other states have tried to do it
 
04:36:40.189 --> 04:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
so where did the where did the language
 
04:36:42.769 --> 04:36:42.779 align:start position:0%
for this law come from
 
04:36:45.230 --> 04:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
it came uh and this this actually
 
04:36:48.289 --> 04:36:48.299 align:start position:0%
reference to it in the report uh to this
 
04:36:51.709 --> 04:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
model language that is in 645.
 
04:36:55.250 --> 04:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
it came from a group called koala uh
 
04:36:57.590 --> 04:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
koala with a c not a k
 
04:36:59.390 --> 04:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
and that stands for the Coalition of
 
04:37:02.209 --> 04:37:02.219 align:start position:0%
automated legal applications so legal
 
04:37:04.250 --> 04:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
application automated legal applications
 
04:37:06.051 --> 04:37:06.061 align:start position:0%
is another it's a fancy way to say smart
 
04:37:06.061 --> 04:37:07.970 align:start position:0%
is another it's a fancy way to say smart
contracts

04:37:07.970 --> 04:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
04:37:10.789 --> 04:37:10.799 align:start position:0%
and uh they have a good explainer
 
04:37:13.730 --> 04:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
document on so this this language was
 
04:37:16.070 --> 04:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
adopted from their model law and it's a
 
04:37:17.150 --> 04:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
starting point
 
04:37:19.789 --> 04:37:19.799 align:start position:0%
we heard yesterday that we never pass a
 
04:37:20.990 --> 04:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
bill out of this committee without an
 
04:37:23.929 --> 04:37:23.939 align:start position:0%
amendment I think this bill will fit
 
04:37:26.810 --> 04:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
into that history very very nicely
 
04:37:28.789 --> 04:37:28.799 align:start position:0%
um but it's this starting point came
 
04:37:31.310 --> 04:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
from this group of academics from all
 
04:37:32.750 --> 04:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
around the world who developed this
 
04:37:32.760 --> 04:37:33.830 align:start position:0%
around the world who developed this
language

04:37:33.830 --> 04:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:37:37.369 --> 04:37:37.379 align:start position:0%
and it's a language that is intended for
 
04:37:39.949 --> 04:37:39.959 align:start position:0%
States and even countries to adopt and
 
04:37:41.029 --> 04:37:41.039 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you a brief outline
 
04:37:44.990 --> 04:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
very brief there's there's six chapters
 
04:37:49.010 --> 04:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh sections in on our bill so the first
 
04:37:50.929 --> 04:37:50.939 align:start position:0%
four sections kind of map to the
 
04:37:52.910 --> 04:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
traditional corporate structures
 
04:37:55.131 --> 04:37:55.141 align:start position:0%
chapter 1 outlines the activities that
 
04:37:57.230 --> 04:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
dials can engage in and their rights as
 
04:37:58.670 --> 04:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
a separate legal entity along with
 
04:38:00.590 --> 04:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
important definitions so that's that's
 
04:38:02.029 --> 04:38:02.039 align:start position:0%
section one I think we call them
 
04:38:02.039 --> 04:38:05.631 align:start position:0%
section one I think we call them
sections

04:38:05.631 --> 04:38:05.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:08.510 --> 04:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh number two outlines the technical and
 
04:38:11.269 --> 04:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
governance requirements for Dows to have
 
04:38:14.090 --> 04:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
legal personality and limited liability
 
04:38:17.709 --> 04:38:17.719 align:start position:0%
protection so just like a corporation
 
04:38:20.449 --> 04:38:20.459 align:start position:0%
is given a legal personhood so that it
 
04:38:22.131 --> 04:38:22.141 align:start position:0%
can operate and make decisions interact
 
04:38:24.349 --> 04:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
with the rest of society and also
 
04:38:26.330 --> 04:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
liability protection
 
04:38:28.970 --> 04:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
chapter 3 explains the potential actions
 
04:38:31.789 --> 04:38:31.799 align:start position:0%
that may result in forfeiture of limited
 
04:38:33.529 --> 04:38:33.539 align:start position:0%
liability protection
 
04:38:37.849 --> 04:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
allows for uh the reasons for when there
 
04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
might be personal liability
 
04:38:41.810 --> 04:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
and it creates it explains the
 
04:38:43.609 --> 04:38:43.619 align:start position:0%
flexibility of dowels to create
 
04:38:47.449 --> 04:38:47.459 align:start position:0%
governance structures and Reserve funds
 
04:38:48.650 --> 04:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
so governance would be the
 
04:38:50.269 --> 04:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
decision-making Reserve funds would be
 
04:38:52.070 --> 04:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
the capital
 
04:38:54.830 --> 04:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh four deals with the governance of
 
04:38:56.689 --> 04:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
dows allowing for flexibility and
 
04:38:56.699 --> 04:38:58.551 align:start position:0%
dows allowing for flexibility and
representation

04:38:58.551 --> 04:38:58.561 align:start position:0%
representation
 
04:39:02.449 --> 04:39:02.459 align:start position:0%
on and off chain off chain that means in
 
04:39:05.449 --> 04:39:05.459 align:start position:0%
code on the blockchain or in maybe a a
 
04:39:08.029 --> 04:39:08.039 align:start position:0%
paper document that the uh the group
 
04:39:11.631 --> 04:39:11.641 align:start position:0%
agrees to be governed by the bylaws
 
04:39:13.310 --> 04:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
and then chapter five addresses
 
04:39:15.949 --> 04:39:15.959 align:start position:0%
technical aspects of dowels
 
04:39:17.769 --> 04:39:17.779 align:start position:0%
such as
 
04:39:21.890 --> 04:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
what is a a contentious Fork
 
04:39:23.810 --> 04:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
I won't go into that definition but a
 
04:39:26.390 --> 04:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
contentious Fork it's a fork in the
 
04:39:28.670 --> 04:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
direction of the code
 
04:39:30.890 --> 04:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
and what happens in the case of failure
 
04:39:32.150 --> 04:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
events we know when you run code
 
04:39:34.189 --> 04:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes the code can have an error so
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
that would be a failure event so what
 
04:39:39.110 --> 04:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
are the conditions and Technical aspects
 
04:39:41.270 --> 04:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
of that and then finally
 
04:39:43.430 --> 04:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
um it includes Provisions this is number
 
04:39:43.440 --> 04:39:44.448 align:start position:0%
um it includes Provisions this is number
six

04:39:44.448 --> 04:39:44.458 align:start position:0%
six
 
04:39:46.610 --> 04:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
for when General business organization
 
04:39:49.250 --> 04:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
law should be applied to dowels
 
04:39:51.708 --> 04:39:51.718 align:start position:0%
and recognition of dows as paths through
 
04:39:54.530 --> 04:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
entities for tax purposes
 
04:39:56.690 --> 04:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
so those are the six different sections
 
04:40:01.310 --> 04:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:03.350 --> 04:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
um I think I'll I'll stop there I think
 
04:40:04.610 --> 04:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty good overview and I'll
 
04:40:08.690 --> 04:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
open up the questions and uh
 
04:40:11.570 --> 04:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions Mr chair
 
04:40:15.350 --> 04:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh
 
04:40:17.390 --> 04:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative McAleer I think you were
 
04:40:19.850 --> 04:40:19.860 align:start position:0%
first uh thank you thank you
 
04:40:22.330 --> 04:40:22.340 align:start position:0%
um Keith a question here
 
04:40:25.250 --> 04:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
what what sort of entity what kind of
 
04:40:27.708 --> 04:40:27.718 align:start position:0%
business would be operated here and then
 
04:40:30.050 --> 04:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned that that everybody
 
04:40:32.690 --> 04:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
that is a player so to speak makes a
 
04:40:34.788 --> 04:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
decision so how does a decision
 
04:40:37.250 --> 04:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
ultimately get decided
 
04:40:40.190 --> 04:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
so what kind of business and and how the
 
04:40:42.230 --> 04:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
ultimate decision of what may be an
 
04:40:44.448 --> 04:40:44.458 align:start position:0%
example of a decision that might be
 
04:40:46.070 --> 04:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
considered thank you
 
04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a so those are two questions
 
04:40:49.788 --> 04:40:49.798 align:start position:0%
and they're both sort of broad I'll try
 
04:40:51.170 --> 04:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
to keep it simple
 
04:40:51.180 --> 04:40:52.070 align:start position:0%
to keep it simple
um

04:40:52.070 --> 04:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:55.910 --> 04:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh so what type of business uh so
 
04:40:59.510 --> 04:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
anything a corporation might have as a
 
04:41:01.970 --> 04:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
purpose right it potentially it could
 
04:41:04.070 --> 04:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
own physical property like say a real
 
04:41:06.410 --> 04:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
estate you know an apartment building
 
04:41:08.510 --> 04:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
you could you could
 
04:41:10.550 --> 04:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
um but what's tending to happen right
 
04:41:14.270 --> 04:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
now is people are getting together to
 
04:41:16.610 --> 04:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
develop you could call them protocols
 
04:41:19.070 --> 04:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
which are not really businesses it's
 
04:41:23.030 --> 04:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
more of like a language that does a
 
04:41:25.730 --> 04:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
certain thing so like a simple way to
 
04:41:28.970 --> 04:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
email is a protocol right so email is a
 
04:41:31.070 --> 04:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
very useful thing but it's not really a
 
04:41:34.250 --> 04:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
company email is a way for computers to
 
04:41:36.110 --> 04:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
talk to each other to deliver messages
 
04:41:38.868 --> 04:41:38.878 align:start position:0%
right so there are new protocols being
 
04:41:40.910 --> 04:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
developed that groups of people are
 
04:41:43.010 --> 04:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
doing and it might take
 
04:41:45.708 --> 04:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
coders it might take marketers it might
 
04:41:48.590 --> 04:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
take people building a you know a
 
04:41:50.270 --> 04:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
website to advertise it and all
 
04:41:51.470 --> 04:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
different functions that a corporation
 
04:41:53.930 --> 04:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
might have but there's there's other
 
04:41:56.690 --> 04:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
examples of what Dallas can do and I'd
 
04:41:58.010 --> 04:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
encourage you to
 
04:42:00.650 --> 04:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
you know look it up search it some
 
04:42:02.330 --> 04:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
interesting ones that I ran across there
 
04:42:06.650 --> 04:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
was a dow to buy an original copy of the
 
04:42:09.170 --> 04:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
U.S Constitution so a bunch of people
 
04:42:10.430 --> 04:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
got together
 
04:42:13.010 --> 04:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
and they tried to organize that and I
 
04:42:15.230 --> 04:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
don't think that went anywhere
 
04:42:20.030 --> 04:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
um there's a dow to organize for um
 
04:42:23.810 --> 04:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
uh support for the war effort in Ukraine
 
04:42:25.730 --> 04:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
so there's something called the Ukraine
 
04:42:28.850 --> 04:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
Dao that uh is doing that so those are
 
04:42:31.250 --> 04:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
just extreme examples but anything in
 
04:42:33.110 --> 04:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
anything a corporation can do
 
04:42:35.628 --> 04:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
corporations benefit from having a
 
04:42:37.430 --> 04:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
hierarchical structure where a few
 
04:42:38.868 --> 04:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
people at the top make most of the
 
04:42:40.250 --> 04:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
decisions and receive most of the
 
04:42:42.770 --> 04:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
information that's suitable for maybe
 
04:42:45.288 --> 04:42:45.298 align:start position:0%
Boeing and Martin Lockheed
 
04:42:47.628 --> 04:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
um a dow was more of like a
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
decentralized crowd-sourced
 
04:42:54.650 --> 04:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:58.190 --> 04:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your presenting this uh
 
04:43:01.730 --> 04:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
interesting idea for the state and I
 
04:43:03.948 --> 04:43:03.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh the effort of trying to
 
04:43:06.830 --> 04:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
bring blockchain into the state's uh
 
04:43:08.448 --> 04:43:08.458 align:start position:0%
legal governmental structure I certainly
 
04:43:10.730 --> 04:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
think that blockchain is probably the
 
04:43:12.050 --> 04:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
next revolution in the way that we're
 
04:43:14.510 --> 04:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
going to govern the state as well as uh
 
04:43:17.750 --> 04:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
govern transactions in the state
 
04:43:17.760 --> 04:43:18.650 align:start position:0%
govern transactions in the state
um

04:43:18.650 --> 04:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:21.410 --> 04:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
however I think that if we're going to
 
04:43:23.390 --> 04:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
bring blockchain and blockchain entities
 
04:43:26.510 --> 04:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
into being a third type of corporate
 
04:43:28.010 --> 04:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
personhood as we will have corporations
 
04:43:30.530 --> 04:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
we'll have LLCs and love Dells
 
04:43:33.650 --> 04:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
this may be uh the beginning of a bill
 
04:43:35.270 --> 04:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
but if we look for example the state's
 
04:43:37.070 --> 04:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
Corporation law or LLC law we have
 
04:43:38.510 --> 04:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
something more similar to the report you
 
04:43:41.868 --> 04:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
have in your desk UH 60 to 100 page bill
 
04:43:45.170 --> 04:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
uh rather than something as thin as this
 
04:43:46.430 --> 04:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
um part of the reason for that is when
 
04:43:47.810 --> 04:43:47.820 align:start position:0%
we start to really look at when we
 
04:43:47.820 --> 04:43:48.788 align:start position:0%
we start to really look at when we
address

04:43:48.788 --> 04:43:48.798 align:start position:0%
address
 
04:43:51.470 --> 04:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
personhood we need to ask questions for
 
04:43:54.288 --> 04:43:54.298 align:start position:0%
example if I were to sue the dowel where
 
04:43:56.510 --> 04:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
do I achieve service of process if I
 
04:43:58.190 --> 04:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
were to sue the dial where does venue
 
04:44:01.670 --> 04:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
occur if I were to sue the dell and uh
 
04:44:03.410 --> 04:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
where is that suit actually going to
 
04:44:07.310 --> 04:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
occur if I and then another issue that
 
04:44:10.010 --> 04:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
occurs in this is that we the dowel can
 
04:44:11.810 --> 04:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
essentially bootstrap itself into
 
04:44:15.110 --> 04:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
existence to it's essentially I exist
 
04:44:16.850 --> 04:44:16.860 align:start position:0%
because I am
 
04:44:19.730 --> 04:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
but we don't allow corporations to do
 
04:44:22.128 --> 04:44:22.138 align:start position:0%
that because we're not creating
 
04:44:23.990 --> 04:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
corporations for their own benefits
 
04:44:25.550 --> 04:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
we're also creating corporations to
 
04:44:27.650 --> 04:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
protect the public that if a corporation
 
04:44:29.330 --> 04:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
creates a bad contract who wants to
 
04:44:31.128 --> 04:44:31.138 align:start position:0%
protect the public against that bad
 
04:44:33.530 --> 04:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
contract similarly if the Dow creates a
 
04:44:35.990 --> 04:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
bad smart contract we want to create
 
04:44:37.610 --> 04:44:37.620 align:start position:0%
protect the public against that
 
04:44:39.708 --> 04:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
therefore we don't allow a corporation
 
04:44:42.830 --> 04:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
to exist because they they are we create
 
04:44:44.628 --> 04:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
a corporation to exist because the
 
04:44:47.390 --> 04:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State said they are so how
 
04:44:49.550 --> 04:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
do we protect the public against a bad
 
04:44:51.830 --> 04:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
Dow we need to create a registration
 
04:44:54.110 --> 04:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism this again doesn't address
 
04:44:54.120 --> 04:44:55.190 align:start position:0%
mechanism this again doesn't address
that

04:44:55.190 --> 04:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:44:59.270 --> 04:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
so I think that we need to uh well I'm
 
04:45:01.970 --> 04:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
getting to the question how do you how
 
04:45:03.590 --> 04:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
do you address each of these questions
 
04:45:05.930 --> 04:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
that I've created here how do we achieve
 
04:45:07.670 --> 04:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
Services process how do we achieve venue
 
04:45:09.650 --> 04:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
how do we achieve a registration
 
04:45:12.350 --> 04:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
mechanism and how other states address
 
04:45:15.890 --> 04:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
this and where do we begin to address
 
04:45:17.690 --> 04:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
these voluminous issues that are
 
04:45:19.190 --> 04:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
addressed in the corporations act that
 
04:45:21.110 --> 04:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
are addressed in the LLC Act and why
 
04:45:24.530 --> 04:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:26.690 --> 04:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
I sent some emotion in your question
 
04:45:26.700 --> 04:45:28.990 align:start position:0%
I sent some emotion in your question
there

04:45:28.990 --> 04:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:45:32.690 --> 04:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:35.390 --> 04:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
so those are all very good questions
 
04:45:35.400 --> 04:45:36.410 align:start position:0%
so those are all very good questions
um

04:45:36.410 --> 04:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:38.868 --> 04:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
and as I said this bill
 
04:45:41.270 --> 04:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
if it's going to pass will be amended so
 
04:45:43.128 --> 04:45:43.138 align:start position:0%
we're looking for feedback such as what
 
04:45:44.990 --> 04:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
you just stated
 
04:45:47.570 --> 04:45:47.580 align:start position:0%
um the other states that I mentioned
 
04:45:50.330 --> 04:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
have tried to answer those questions by
 
04:45:52.490 --> 04:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
sort of pigeonholing a dow into the
 
04:45:54.470 --> 04:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
existing corporate structure we're
 
04:45:55.850 --> 04:45:55.860 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
04:45:59.330 --> 04:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
a more of a of a carrot approach than a
 
04:46:01.490 --> 04:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
stick approach as to attracting dowels
 
04:46:03.530 --> 04:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire but making sure that
 
04:46:06.230 --> 04:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
they're good corporate citizens uh and
 
04:46:08.030 --> 04:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
so some of those questions I think will
 
04:46:10.550 --> 04:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed before this bill uh
 
04:46:12.288 --> 04:46:12.298 align:start position:0%
I I know there's there are people coming
 
04:46:15.110 --> 04:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
behind me that will be more expert in
 
04:46:16.850 --> 04:46:16.860 align:start position:0%
exactly what you were asking so I'm
 
04:46:19.128 --> 04:46:19.138 align:start position:0%
gonna I'll do that thing where we defer
 
04:46:21.110 --> 04:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
to the smart people behind us so but
 
04:46:23.030 --> 04:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:46:25.910 --> 04:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gibbs
 
04:46:27.650 --> 04:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:46:29.990 --> 04:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
can you explain
 
04:46:33.050 --> 04:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
um how it is possible for the members of
 
04:46:36.770 --> 04:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
an organization to come to a decision
 
04:46:39.110 --> 04:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
um rather than using what I would
 
04:46:42.530 --> 04:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
consider the normal traditional methods
 
04:46:45.890 --> 04:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
uh of discussion and vote
 
04:46:49.310 --> 04:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
um but instead uh by means of computer
 
04:46:53.448 --> 04:46:53.458 align:start position:0%
codes and then can you explain
 
04:46:56.150 --> 04:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
um what the advantage is
 
04:46:59.150 --> 04:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
um to the people of New Hampshire uh of
 
04:47:02.570 --> 04:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
having such an organization thank you
 
04:47:04.850 --> 04:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
okay so those are two interesting
 
04:47:06.410 --> 04:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for those and I'll
 
04:47:07.670 --> 04:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
I'll compliment you on your questions
 
04:47:09.948 --> 04:47:09.958 align:start position:0%
while I think of the answers
 
04:47:09.958 --> 04:47:11.690 align:start position:0%
while I think of the answers
um

04:47:11.690 --> 04:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:14.990 --> 04:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
so the way that computer uh code works
 
04:47:17.330 --> 04:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
in the in
 
04:47:20.448 --> 04:47:20.458 align:start position:0%
so computer code can display things on
 
04:47:22.190 --> 04:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
your screen it could make sounds that
 
04:47:24.110 --> 04:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
come out of speakers right so that's not
 
04:47:25.368 --> 04:47:25.378 align:start position:0%
the type of computer code that we're
 
04:47:26.570 --> 04:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
talking about we're talking about
 
04:47:29.750 --> 04:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
specifically smart contracts which are
 
04:47:32.270 --> 04:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
you can think of them as like
 
04:47:34.610 --> 04:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
Snippets of a program
 
04:47:39.410 --> 04:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
that are that the inputs are are value
 
04:47:41.930 --> 04:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
or tokens it's not any kind of input
 
04:47:45.110 --> 04:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's not it's specific types of input
 
04:47:47.510 --> 04:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
and excuse me that that that's
 
04:47:49.970 --> 04:47:49.980 align:start position:0%
meaningless to me value or tokens yes
 
04:47:52.810 --> 04:47:52.820 align:start position:0%
what kind of value yes
 
04:47:55.250 --> 04:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
Excuse me yes thank you what kind of
 
04:47:56.930 --> 04:47:56.940 align:start position:0%
value so we're talking about digital
 
04:47:58.850 --> 04:47:58.860 align:start position:0%
assets so we're talking about remember
 
04:48:00.170 --> 04:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
the other day we were talking about the
 
04:48:02.150 --> 04:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
UCC and about how there are digital
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
assets that people can own and control
 
04:48:06.590 --> 04:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about
 
04:48:10.070 --> 04:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
and so and and so let me just see if I
 
04:48:12.590 --> 04:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
can let me see if I can relate to what
 
04:48:15.770 --> 04:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
something that you might know so uh a
 
04:48:15.780 --> 04:48:17.030 align:start position:0%
something that you might know so uh a
law

04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:48:19.368 --> 04:48:19.378 align:start position:0%
a judge interpreting a law right the law
 
04:48:22.190 --> 04:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
was written by humans and the law in it
 
04:48:22.200 --> 04:48:23.270 align:start position:0%
was written by humans and the law in it
has

04:48:23.270 --> 04:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:48:26.510 --> 04:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh what are the conditions that initiate
 
04:48:29.868 --> 04:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
the consideration of that law and uh it
 
04:48:32.150 --> 04:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
might have you know if this happened do
 
04:48:34.788 --> 04:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
this or if this happened it has a
 
04:48:37.430 --> 04:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
logical structure to the law right and
 
04:48:40.368 --> 04:48:40.378 align:start position:0%
then it has either no no consequence or
 
04:48:41.628 --> 04:48:41.638 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a penalty there's
 
04:48:43.970 --> 04:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
something something positive or negative
 
04:48:47.208 --> 04:48:47.218 align:start position:0%
that is the result of that law
 
04:48:48.830 --> 04:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
well you can do a lot of those same
 
04:48:49.910 --> 04:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
things now
 
04:48:53.330 --> 04:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
in in uh something called smart
 
04:48:55.430 --> 04:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
contracts there's a lot of overlap and
 
04:48:56.690 --> 04:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of lawyers that are
 
04:48:59.090 --> 04:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
looking to become specialists in smart
 
04:49:00.350 --> 04:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
contracts because there is a lot of
 
04:49:02.690 --> 04:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
overlap that's that's how the decision
 
04:49:05.690 --> 04:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
making is is made if I can
 
04:49:07.730 --> 04:49:07.740 align:start position:0%
you know keep it as simple as possible
 
04:49:09.708 --> 04:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm sorry that's still not
 
04:49:12.110 --> 04:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
clear you may inquire
 
04:49:18.410 --> 04:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:21.110 --> 04:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
you may have a follow-up
 
04:49:23.570 --> 04:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
okay I I am a lawyer
 
04:49:25.368 --> 04:49:25.378 align:start position:0%
um and I have written computer programs
 
04:49:26.868 --> 04:49:26.878 align:start position:0%
in the way you have described very
 
04:49:28.070 --> 04:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
simple ones
 
04:49:30.948 --> 04:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
um but I understand that concept
 
04:49:33.830 --> 04:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
um what I cannot get is
 
04:49:36.410 --> 04:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
from there to a group making a decision
 
04:49:38.930 --> 04:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
by that means
 
04:49:40.850 --> 04:49:40.860 align:start position:0%
so it has to do with how the the
 
04:49:42.770 --> 04:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
computer code is structured right so you
 
04:49:44.990 --> 04:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
have you need a certain number let's say
 
04:49:46.850 --> 04:49:46.860 align:start position:0%
you've written programs before let's
 
04:49:50.590 --> 04:49:50.600 align:start position:0%
let's say you need 51 people out of 100
 
04:49:53.570 --> 04:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
to decide that something is true if
 
04:49:55.430 --> 04:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
those 51
 
04:49:57.708 --> 04:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
if it's fewer than 51 then the outcome
 
04:50:00.170 --> 04:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
is is false right so that's a way of
 
04:50:01.970 --> 04:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
people being able to vote
 
04:50:05.270 --> 04:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
on the outcome of uh you know a
 
04:50:07.368 --> 04:50:07.378 align:start position:0%
cascading logical event
 
04:50:09.350 --> 04:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
and so that's as simple as I can make it
 
04:50:13.250 --> 04:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
and because the crypto the cryptography
 
04:50:15.350 --> 04:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
behind blockchain one of the things it
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
does is it allows people to prove that
 
04:50:19.250 --> 04:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
they are who they are or they they have
 
04:50:22.128 --> 04:50:22.138 align:start position:0%
control over those voting rights the
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
explanation that it's a vote actually
 
04:50:26.570 --> 04:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
does make sense and so I thank you I'm
 
04:50:29.390 --> 04:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
happy to talk about it offline
 
04:50:31.610 --> 04:50:31.620 align:start position:0%
um but uh follow-up second half of my
 
04:50:34.490 --> 04:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
question yeah sure manage if I may yes
 
04:50:35.990 --> 04:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
you may thank you
 
04:50:39.230 --> 04:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
um can you tell us what the advantage is
 
04:50:42.230 --> 04:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I started out my testimony that way
 
04:50:43.970 --> 04:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
um that it's it's a new way of
 
04:50:46.430 --> 04:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
collective action and uh it's a new type
 
04:50:47.628 --> 04:50:47.638 align:start position:0%
of structure
 
04:50:49.910 --> 04:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's happening right now on the
 
04:50:49.920 --> 04:50:50.810 align:start position:0%
uh it's happening right now on the
internet

04:50:50.810 --> 04:50:50.820 align:start position:0%
internet
 
04:50:53.030 --> 04:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it's going on you can't
 
04:50:55.128 --> 04:50:55.138 align:start position:0%
see it because it's virtual but it's
 
04:50:56.930 --> 04:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
happening right now
 
04:51:00.288 --> 04:51:00.298 align:start position:0%
um and it's a way to sort of democratize
 
04:51:02.030 --> 04:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
Collective action like some of the
 
04:51:02.990 --> 04:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
things that we don't like about
 
04:51:05.750 --> 04:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
corporations are sort of solved by this
 
04:51:07.910 --> 04:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
new way of of organizing because it's
 
04:51:10.750 --> 04:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
it's more democratic it's more
 
04:51:13.550 --> 04:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
egalitarian it allows people to have
 
04:51:15.590 --> 04:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
ownership over what they're working on
 
04:51:18.410 --> 04:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
instead of being a wage slave in a job
 
04:51:21.530 --> 04:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
so instead of you accruing all the value
 
04:51:23.750 --> 04:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
to your employer because you're a part
 
04:51:25.910 --> 04:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
owner you you're accruing some of that
 
04:51:28.128 --> 04:51:28.138 align:start position:0%
value to yourself and so you're actually
 
04:51:30.530 --> 04:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
able to build wealth by your own efforts
 
04:51:33.650 --> 04:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
with this type of structure
 
04:51:35.510 --> 04:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative spear then
 
04:51:38.750 --> 04:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:40.010 --> 04:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:51:41.810 --> 04:51:41.820 align:start position:0%
uh I kind of hinted to this question
 
04:51:43.970 --> 04:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
before but I guess we didn't have really
 
04:51:45.890 --> 04:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
have time to talk about it
 
04:51:48.350 --> 04:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
you talk about how the Dow gets started
 
04:51:50.330 --> 04:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
you have regulations about how it gets
 
04:51:52.070 --> 04:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
started yeah regulations about what
 
04:51:54.230 --> 04:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
happens if the code crashes you have
 
04:51:56.750 --> 04:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
regulations about how open everything
 
04:51:59.570 --> 04:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
has to be but what happens if the Dow
 
04:52:02.448 --> 04:52:02.458 align:start position:0%
becomes inactive and it has assets and
 
04:52:04.670 --> 04:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
it just kind of dies
 
04:52:06.830 --> 04:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
companies there are things that happen
 
04:52:09.530 --> 04:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
and the state can literally take over
 
04:52:11.208 --> 04:52:11.218 align:start position:0%
you know if somebody doesn't pay their
 
04:52:13.010 --> 04:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
they own a building and they all of a
 
04:52:14.570 --> 04:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
sudden decide well I'm just going to
 
04:52:16.490 --> 04:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
abandon it the stake and take it what
 
04:52:19.010 --> 04:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
happens to a dow we need something I
 
04:52:20.690 --> 04:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
would think in here that says if the Dow
 
04:52:22.788 --> 04:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
has been abandoned what happens to the
 
04:52:25.490 --> 04:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
assets yeah I think in the other state
 
04:52:28.430 --> 04:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
legislation uh I think there's a period
 
04:52:30.770 --> 04:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
of one year inactivity so there has to
 
04:52:32.990 --> 04:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
be just like a corporation has to have
 
04:52:35.448 --> 04:52:35.458 align:start position:0%
meetings uh you know minutes of their
 
04:52:35.458 --> 04:52:36.890 align:start position:0%
meetings uh you know minutes of their
meetings

04:52:36.890 --> 04:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:52:36.900 --> 04:52:37.550 align:start position:0%
meetings
um

04:52:37.550 --> 04:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:39.948 --> 04:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
to stay current with their you know
 
04:52:42.010 --> 04:52:42.020 align:start position:0%
being in good standing with the state
 
04:52:44.208 --> 04:52:44.218 align:start position:0%
the other states have sort of solved it
 
04:52:47.390 --> 04:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
where that Dow would no longer be in
 
04:52:48.650 --> 04:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
good standing
 
04:52:48.660 --> 04:52:49.430 align:start position:0%
good standing
um

04:52:49.430 --> 04:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:51.110 --> 04:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
as far as being able to confiscate
 
04:52:51.120 --> 04:52:53.030 align:start position:0%
as far as being able to confiscate
abandoned

04:52:53.030 --> 04:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
abandoned
 
04:52:55.010 --> 04:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
property it doesn't really work that way
 
04:52:57.410 --> 04:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
in blockchain technology if if you
 
04:52:58.730 --> 04:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
abandon it
 
04:53:02.448 --> 04:53:02.458 align:start position:0%
so I know this is uh it can make
 
04:53:03.770 --> 04:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
people's eyes glaze over because it's
 
04:53:05.628 --> 04:53:05.638 align:start position:0%
technical but no believe me I understand
 
04:53:08.208 --> 04:53:08.218 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so
 
04:53:10.010 --> 04:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
let's say there's a
 
04:53:12.708 --> 04:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
let's say there's a a million dollars of
 
04:53:16.430 --> 04:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
value in this in some vast protocol and
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
a dow owns 10 of it
 
04:53:21.170 --> 04:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
if let's say they lose their key or the
 
04:53:23.570 --> 04:53:23.580 align:start position:0%
are the people all involved uh you know
 
04:53:26.810 --> 04:53:26.820 align:start position:0%
die that 10 becomes unusable it becomes
 
04:53:29.030 --> 04:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
like lost forever and the value accrues
 
04:53:30.610 --> 04:53:30.620 align:start position:0%
to everybody else in the in the program
 
04:53:32.930 --> 04:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
it's different than what you're saying I
 
04:53:34.310 --> 04:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
understand it's different yeah what I'm
 
04:53:36.050 --> 04:53:36.060 align:start position:0%
saying is let's say the Dow decided to
 
04:53:37.788 --> 04:53:37.798 align:start position:0%
get together they you know four guys got
 
04:53:39.230 --> 04:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
the I don't know ten guys got together
 
04:53:40.910 --> 04:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
created a dow and they wanted to buy
 
04:53:40.920 --> 04:53:42.050 align:start position:0%
created a dow and they wanted to buy
land

04:53:42.050 --> 04:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
land
 
04:53:43.730 --> 04:53:43.740 align:start position:0%
all four of them died in an airplane
 
04:53:46.490 --> 04:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
crash who gets the land I think that
 
04:53:48.890 --> 04:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
would be governed by what would because
 
04:53:50.390 --> 04:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's you're talking about physical real
 
04:53:52.850 --> 04:53:52.860 align:start position:0%
world property at that point it would it
 
04:53:55.670 --> 04:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
would uh be governed by what happens now
 
04:53:57.830 --> 04:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
anyway right shouldn't this thing say
 
04:53:57.840 --> 04:53:58.628 align:start position:0%
anyway right shouldn't this thing say
something

04:53:58.628 --> 04:53:58.638 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:54:02.208 --> 04:54:02.218 align:start position:0%
we're open to suggestions yeah
 
04:54:05.570 --> 04:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
representative Terry yes thank you
 
04:54:05.580 --> 04:54:06.350 align:start position:0%
representative Terry yes thank you
um

04:54:06.350 --> 04:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:09.230 --> 04:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
let me preface my question by saying
 
04:54:12.050 --> 04:54:12.060 align:start position:0%
that um if if I'm going to be asked to
 
04:54:14.208 --> 04:54:14.218 align:start position:0%
to act on a particular piece of
 
04:54:16.368 --> 04:54:16.378 align:start position:0%
legislation it's really important that I
 
04:54:19.190 --> 04:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
try to understand it as best I can and I
 
04:54:21.288 --> 04:54:21.298 align:start position:0%
mean this very sincerely that when I
 
04:54:23.150 --> 04:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
when I'm looking at you and listening to
 
04:54:28.128 --> 04:54:28.138 align:start position:0%
you I'm I'm hearing some of my uh uh my
 
04:54:30.830 --> 04:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
my friends in college who were uh on the
 
04:54:33.230 --> 04:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
engineering tract and their brains
 
04:54:36.350 --> 04:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
worked in a certain way and they they
 
04:54:38.390 --> 04:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
were very good at being able to describe
 
04:54:40.430 --> 04:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
in their own language in their own lingo
 
04:54:42.650 --> 04:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
what it is that they were saying but for
 
04:54:44.510 --> 04:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
those of us who are in the liberal arts
 
04:54:46.910 --> 04:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh economics and so forth we would our
 
04:54:49.670 --> 04:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
ours would glaze over so thinking back
 
04:54:52.070 --> 04:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
to when I was in elementary school the
 
04:54:54.890 --> 04:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
way that I learned uh was by reading
 
04:54:57.288 --> 04:54:57.298 align:start position:0%
words but then seeing references being
 
04:55:01.190 --> 04:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
made to illustrations or figures and I'm
 
04:55:02.750 --> 04:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could help me and
 
04:55:04.550 --> 04:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps some of the others of us who are
 
04:55:07.070 --> 04:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
not as far along as uh representative
 
04:55:09.830 --> 04:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
Philo with his incredibly impressive
 
04:55:13.390 --> 04:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
cerebral questions that our PhD level
 
04:55:17.090 --> 04:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
and have yes obviously yes and and and
 
04:55:20.690 --> 04:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
maybe do like an illustration an example
 
04:55:22.910 --> 04:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
of what a Dao is and how it would
 
04:55:25.190 --> 04:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
function so that I could see this in
 
04:55:27.948 --> 04:55:27.958 align:start position:0%
pictures okay I don't need photographs
 
04:55:29.510 --> 04:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
they're visual will actually work
 
04:55:32.270 --> 04:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
through the do a basic presentation of
 
04:55:35.390 --> 04:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
How It's formed and how it works that
 
04:55:37.670 --> 04:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
would get be me Beyond first grade to at
 
04:55:39.830 --> 04:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
least second grade absolutely uh I can't
 
04:55:42.350 --> 04:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
is that possible it is possible maybe
 
04:55:44.448 --> 04:55:44.458 align:start position:0%
even uh because I know you can teach I
 
04:55:46.788 --> 04:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
mean you're doing it with words yeah but
 
04:55:49.850 --> 04:55:49.860 align:start position:0%
visual learning visual visual I'll work
 
04:55:51.110 --> 04:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
on that with you and we'll share it with
 
04:55:52.730 --> 04:55:52.740 align:start position:0%
thank you I really appreciate it I think
 
04:55:54.288 --> 04:55:54.298 align:start position:0%
there'd be great value too not only
 
04:55:55.788 --> 04:55:55.798 align:start position:0%
people on this the members of this
 
04:55:57.650 --> 04:55:57.660 align:start position:0%
committee but the the members of the
 
04:55:59.330 --> 04:55:59.340 align:start position:0%
general public who are going to want to
 
04:56:00.708 --> 04:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
understand this based on what you're
 
04:56:03.050 --> 04:56:03.060 align:start position:0%
telling us about decentralization and
 
04:56:08.628 --> 04:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:08.638 --> 04:56:11.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:56:11.150 --> 04:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:56:13.010 --> 04:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
uh this was actually to address uh
 
04:56:14.448 --> 04:56:14.458 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs question but I
 
04:56:15.650 --> 04:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
think I can do it as a what do you
 
04:56:16.788 --> 04:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
believe would you believe that a
 
04:56:19.430 --> 04:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
blockchain is a block of information
 
04:56:22.310 --> 04:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
that is then chained together
 
04:56:25.970 --> 04:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
in a chain of information but it is
 
04:56:28.490 --> 04:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
can't be changed because it has to exist
 
04:56:30.410 --> 04:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
on a number of computers
 
04:56:32.330 --> 04:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
all of which have to check each other's
 
04:56:35.030 --> 04:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
work and if the computers don't check
 
04:56:37.788 --> 04:56:37.798 align:start position:0%
each other's work in such a way as to
 
04:56:39.948 --> 04:56:39.958 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's right they reject it
 
04:56:42.288 --> 04:56:42.298 align:start position:0%
so that the record can't be changed and
 
04:56:44.270 --> 04:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
that makes sure that we're not creating
 
04:56:46.730 --> 04:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
a falsified record this is different
 
04:56:49.610 --> 04:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
than if I write it down
 
04:56:51.890 --> 04:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
I can write down anything but if
 
04:56:53.810 --> 04:56:53.820 align:start position:0%
everybody if all the computers have to
 
04:56:57.288 --> 04:56:57.298 align:start position:0%
agree then it's harder to falsify the
 
04:56:59.868 --> 04:56:59.878 align:start position:0%
work this actually makes it better than
 
04:57:01.788 --> 04:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
a written record because it's hard to
 
04:57:01.798 --> 04:57:03.230 align:start position:0%
a written record because it's hard to
falsify

04:57:03.230 --> 04:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
falsify
 
04:57:06.050 --> 04:57:06.060 align:start position:0%
every single record on the Chain then
 
04:57:08.868 --> 04:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
goes one to the other because they also
 
04:57:13.310 --> 04:57:13.320 align:start position:0%
link data from one to the other they
 
04:57:15.650 --> 04:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
also have the benefit of existing on
 
04:57:18.830 --> 04:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
every computer in the network so that if
 
04:57:21.170 --> 04:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
even if one computer tried to falsify it
 
04:57:24.410 --> 04:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
we have the other say 49 computers on
 
04:57:26.330 --> 04:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
the network to be able to check the work
 
04:57:29.570 --> 04:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
off from so that also helps to create
 
04:57:33.230 --> 04:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
this immutable record that's why it's a
 
04:57:34.670 --> 04:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
value would you believe that
 
04:57:36.110 --> 04:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative women I would believe
 
04:57:38.448 --> 04:57:38.458 align:start position:0%
that and uh thank you for responding to
 
04:57:41.208 --> 04:57:41.218 align:start position:0%
that so is to follow that line of
 
04:57:42.890 --> 04:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
thinking what value is it for the State
 
04:57:45.530 --> 04:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire well no state has
 
04:57:47.628 --> 04:57:47.638 align:start position:0%
gotten this right first some state is
 
04:57:49.250 --> 04:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
some state or maybe country is going to
 
04:57:52.128 --> 04:57:52.138 align:start position:0%
get this this bill just right the
 
04:57:53.990 --> 04:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
analogy is how Delaware got their
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
corporate law
 
04:57:56.930 --> 04:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
at to a point where all these
 
04:58:00.410 --> 04:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
corporations sorry uh started uh
 
04:58:02.628 --> 04:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
you know incorporating in Delaware right
 
04:58:05.990 --> 04:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
so so the the the the the apple is out
 
04:58:07.550 --> 04:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
there for the picking but these other
 
04:58:09.050 --> 04:58:09.060 align:start position:0%
states haven't gotten it right they're
 
04:58:10.310 --> 04:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
not attracting
 
04:58:12.288 --> 04:58:12.298 align:start position:0%
and if new if New Hampshire gets it
 
04:58:12.298 --> 04:58:13.070 align:start position:0%
and if new if New Hampshire gets it
right

04:58:13.070 --> 04:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:58:16.430 --> 04:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
it allow it provides a bridge between
 
04:58:18.530 --> 04:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
the new way of doing things and the old
 
04:58:20.690 --> 04:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
way of doing things and the bridge
 
04:58:23.448 --> 04:58:23.458 align:start position:0%
connects to the entire world it's not
 
04:58:25.310 --> 04:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
just our state or our country it's
 
04:58:25.320 --> 04:58:26.690 align:start position:0%
just our state or our country it's
everywhere

04:58:26.690 --> 04:58:26.700 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
04:58:29.150 --> 04:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
an analogy to that I can't speak to this
 
04:58:31.430 --> 04:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
in detail but I know someone that can
 
04:58:34.250 --> 04:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
um is the way that New Hampshire adopted
 
04:58:36.890 --> 04:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
Innovations in the trust laws which
 
04:58:39.170 --> 04:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
happened I think a decade or so ago
 
04:58:42.170 --> 04:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
and The Innovation was that the the
 
04:58:44.990 --> 04:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
trust laws could interface with
 
04:58:47.330 --> 04:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions all around the world
 
04:58:49.788 --> 04:58:49.798 align:start position:0%
and so capital from all around the world
 
04:58:53.448 --> 04:58:53.458 align:start position:0%
has come and parked itself in trust in
 
04:58:55.970 --> 04:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
our state so this could be a very
 
04:58:58.910 --> 04:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
similar kind of moment and benefit the
 
04:59:00.170 --> 04:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire as a whole by
 
04:59:02.690 --> 04:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
providing you know potentially
 
04:59:04.368 --> 04:59:04.378 align:start position:0%
prosperity it's got to be safe
 
04:59:07.788 --> 04:59:07.798 align:start position:0%
Prosperity but that Taps into the global
 
04:59:07.798 --> 04:59:08.570 align:start position:0%
Prosperity but that Taps into the global
Network

04:59:08.570 --> 04:59:08.580 align:start position:0%
Network
 
04:59:12.110 --> 04:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
representative Bilo I'm sorry
 
04:59:14.690 --> 04:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
we look alike uh yeah I have a real
 
04:59:15.970 --> 04:59:15.980 align:start position:0%
simple question
 
04:59:18.230 --> 04:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
my twin sister
 
04:59:18.240 --> 04:59:18.970 align:start position:0%
my twin sister
um

04:59:18.970 --> 04:59:18.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:21.350 --> 04:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
just help me understand what the the
 
04:59:23.208 --> 04:59:23.218 align:start position:0%
example with the raising money for you
 
04:59:25.788 --> 04:59:25.798 align:start position:0%
Ukraine with with the um I was gonna say
 
04:59:28.670 --> 04:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
bow which is a Korean dish I like but
 
04:59:28.680 --> 04:59:29.448 align:start position:0%
bow which is a Korean dish I like but
anyway

04:59:29.448 --> 04:59:29.458 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
04:59:31.970 --> 04:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
um why why is that different or better
 
04:59:33.890 --> 04:59:33.900 align:start position:0%
than say if we did it raise money
 
04:59:33.900 --> 04:59:34.788 align:start position:0%
than say if we did it raise money
through

04:59:34.788 --> 04:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:59:36.410 --> 04:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
um a crowd funding
 
04:59:39.650 --> 04:59:39.660 align:start position:0%
um website so it has to do so
 
04:59:41.868 --> 04:59:41.878 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a good question
 
04:59:41.878 --> 04:59:42.550 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a good question
um

04:59:42.550 --> 04:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:46.070 --> 04:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
centralized sites are easy targets for
 
04:59:47.930 --> 04:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
let's say uh
 
04:59:50.030 --> 04:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
let's say the Russians took over Ukraine
 
04:59:52.128 --> 04:59:52.138 align:start position:0%
they could go after the site they could
 
04:59:53.750 --> 04:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
figure out who ran the site they could
 
04:59:55.490 --> 04:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
they have a central point that they can
 
05:00:00.050 --> 05:00:00.060 align:start position:0%
attack and so you can so it's Ukraine
 
05:00:00.060 --> 05:00:02.330 align:start position:0%
attack and so you can so it's Ukraine
dao.love

05:00:02.330 --> 05:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
dao.love
 
05:00:04.310 --> 05:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
.love and you can look it up on your
 
05:00:06.050 --> 05:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
computer and there's the story of how
 
05:00:08.990 --> 05:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
why they decided to create a Dao and it
 
05:00:10.730 --> 05:00:10.740 align:start position:0%
started with a chat group of people
 
05:00:12.170 --> 05:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how they could help
 
05:00:15.230 --> 05:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
their fellow ukrainians and they and
 
05:00:17.208 --> 05:00:17.218 align:start position:0%
someone told them about how this would
 
05:00:19.430 --> 05:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
be a very effective way to organize and
 
05:00:21.350 --> 05:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's what they did and so they've you
 
05:00:22.670 --> 05:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
know and the stories on that website
 
05:00:25.250 --> 05:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a neat yeah
 
05:00:35.990 --> 05:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:37.850 --> 05:00:37.860 align:start position:0%
for example I'll give you an example in
 
05:00:39.948 --> 05:00:39.958 align:start position:0%
the document here
 
05:00:39.958 --> 05:00:41.570 align:start position:0%
the document here
um

05:00:41.570 --> 05:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:46.368 --> 05:00:46.378 align:start position:0%
first page item three says the validity
 
05:00:49.368 --> 05:00:49.378 align:start position:0%
of an action by a Dao as authorized
 
05:00:50.690 --> 05:00:50.700 align:start position:0%
under the
 
05:00:53.570 --> 05:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
this chapter shall not be challenged on
 
05:00:57.350 --> 05:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
the ground that the Dao lacks power to
 
05:00:57.360 --> 05:00:58.250 align:start position:0%
the ground that the Dao lacks power to
act

05:00:58.250 --> 05:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
act
 
05:01:01.730 --> 05:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:04.070 --> 05:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
I don't understand the sentence it's a
 
05:01:06.530 --> 05:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
legal term uh I'm gonna
 
05:01:09.770 --> 05:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
defer to someone behind me and uh maybe
 
05:01:11.448 --> 05:01:11.458 align:start position:0%
it'll defer all the way back to until no
 
05:01:13.788 --> 05:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
one's there but uh it it has to do with
 
05:01:16.430 --> 05:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
how a dow can uh
 
05:01:20.208 --> 05:01:20.218 align:start position:0%
can act when making decisions
 
05:01:23.150 --> 05:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes a doll can't reach consensus I
 
05:01:25.010 --> 05:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
think that would be one example let's
 
05:01:27.050 --> 05:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
see a group of people can't decide on
 
05:01:28.430 --> 05:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
which direction to go so there's no
 
05:01:30.708 --> 05:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
Direction so that could be one possible
 
05:01:30.718 --> 05:01:32.330 align:start position:0%
Direction so that could be one possible
outcome

05:01:32.330 --> 05:01:32.340 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
05:01:35.150 --> 05:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
I I
 
05:01:37.368 --> 05:01:37.378 align:start position:0%
don't understand where the Dow power
 
05:01:40.128 --> 05:01:40.138 align:start position:0%
comes from that he can't that it can't
 
05:01:42.230 --> 05:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
there therefore yeah it's not important
 
05:01:46.368 --> 05:01:46.378 align:start position:0%
so so the rules are fixed in in code
 
05:01:48.470 --> 05:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
immutable code as uh representative Phil
 
05:01:50.628 --> 05:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
I was talking about
 
05:01:53.868 --> 05:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
um and and an outcome of a vote could be
 
05:01:55.610 --> 05:01:55.620 align:start position:0%
no action right like if there's a tie in
 
05:01:58.550 --> 05:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
this committee there's no action and
 
05:02:01.730 --> 05:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
that could be a reason why Dao can't be
 
05:02:04.788 --> 05:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
can't act because there's they can't in
 
05:02:06.590 --> 05:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
that moment of time they can't agree on
 
05:02:08.390 --> 05:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
on doing something maybe later they can
 
05:02:10.670 --> 05:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
so I think that would apply to the
 
05:02:10.680 --> 05:02:12.670 align:start position:0%
so I think that would apply to the
question

05:02:12.670 --> 05:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:02:15.350 --> 05:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
following question
 
05:02:16.430 --> 05:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
05:02:16.440 --> 05:02:17.570 align:start position:0%
um okay
um but

05:02:17.570 --> 05:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
um but
 
05:02:19.910 --> 05:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
I'm I don't understand why the sentence
 
05:02:22.670 --> 05:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
is even there because you can't act you
 
05:02:26.330 --> 05:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
can't act uh but now this this reference
 
05:02:29.270 --> 05:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
is a challenge on the ground that the
 
05:02:29.280 --> 05:02:30.470 align:start position:0%
is a challenge on the ground that the
Dow

05:02:30.470 --> 05:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
Dow
 
05:02:33.770 --> 05:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
lacks power to act
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
um to me that's a sentence that has no
 
05:02:38.330 --> 05:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
meaning and I I just
 
05:02:40.250 --> 05:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
yeah it doesn't compute I'll have to
 
05:02:42.590 --> 05:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
look at the original model law and maybe
 
05:02:44.570 --> 05:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
it got lost in translation with OLS I
 
05:02:45.770 --> 05:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that so I'll
 
05:02:47.208 --> 05:02:47.218 align:start position:0%
have to get back to you on that all
 
05:02:47.218 --> 05:02:49.310 align:start position:0%
have to get back to you on that all
right

05:02:49.310 --> 05:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:51.650 --> 05:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
representative Porcelli the last
 
05:02:51.660 --> 05:02:53.030 align:start position:0%
representative Porcelli the last
question

05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:02:58.910 --> 05:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:01.368 --> 05:03:01.378 align:start position:0%
it's responsible for as far as
 
05:03:03.350 --> 05:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
governance goes
 
05:03:05.330 --> 05:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
and if it's in this section just
 
05:03:07.670 --> 05:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
reference that section I'm not sure what
 
05:03:10.190 --> 05:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
it is that we're asking the state to do
 
05:03:12.890 --> 05:03:12.900 align:start position:0%
yeah you know it's something I had
 
05:03:15.770 --> 05:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
further down and it's about
 
05:03:16.850 --> 05:03:16.860 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's about
 
05:03:20.330 --> 05:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
registration so how do you take out a
 
05:03:22.850 --> 05:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
group of people and register a group of
 
05:03:24.530 --> 05:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
people that doesn't have a hierarchy
 
05:03:26.390 --> 05:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
like a traditional Corporation and
 
05:03:27.708 --> 05:03:27.718 align:start position:0%
register it
 
05:03:30.050 --> 05:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
and the other aspect is consumer
 
05:03:32.510 --> 05:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
protection because the smart contracts
 
05:03:35.448 --> 05:03:35.458 align:start position:0%
are the governing documents in a
 
05:03:37.190 --> 05:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
traditional Corporation they have
 
05:03:39.410 --> 05:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
written bylaws or you know the charter
 
05:03:41.690 --> 05:03:41.700 align:start position:0%
or however they write down their purpose
 
05:03:44.690 --> 05:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
and the rules of the but in a
 
05:03:47.270 --> 05:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
in a dowel the the governing documents
 
05:03:48.590 --> 05:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
are is code
 
05:03:50.930 --> 05:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
it's code on the blockchain and so
 
05:03:53.030 --> 05:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
consumer protection we we know that most
 
05:03:55.310 --> 05:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
people in the state can't understand the
 
05:03:58.490 --> 05:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
code so we want to have a way for
 
05:04:00.650 --> 05:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
that code to be registered so we know
 
05:04:02.330 --> 05:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
which version what what code we're
 
05:04:04.670 --> 05:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
talking about and then we want to waive
 
05:04:06.850 --> 05:04:06.860 align:start position:0%
for uh there's something called the
 
05:04:10.670 --> 05:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
accredation uh Authority that's listed
 
05:04:10.680 --> 05:04:12.170 align:start position:0%
accredation uh Authority that's listed
here

05:04:12.170 --> 05:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:04:12.180 --> 05:04:13.010 align:start position:0%
here
um

05:04:13.010 --> 05:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:14.930 --> 05:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
I think we all got this piece of paper
 
05:04:17.390 --> 05:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
from the interoperability lab this is
 
05:04:19.970 --> 05:04:19.980 align:start position:0%
testimony that they emailed us and so
 
05:04:22.490 --> 05:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
the idea is that the interoperability
 
05:04:25.850 --> 05:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
lab is a part of unh
 
05:04:30.708 --> 05:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
and they check uh the the hardware and
 
05:04:33.890 --> 05:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
software of networking devices pretty
 
05:04:35.628 --> 05:04:35.638 align:start position:0%
much any networking device that you buy
 
05:04:38.230 --> 05:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
has gone through the unh
 
05:04:40.128 --> 05:04:40.138 align:start position:0%
interoperability lab
 
05:04:42.650 --> 05:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
so there's a possibility that we could
 
05:04:44.930 --> 05:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
utilize their existing
 
05:04:44.940 --> 05:04:45.910 align:start position:0%
utilize their existing
um

05:04:45.910 --> 05:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
expertise to have people check the code
 
05:04:52.610 --> 05:04:52.620 align:start position:0%
so that they can sort of put their stamp
 
05:04:54.948 --> 05:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
that the code is doing what
 
05:04:57.110 --> 05:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
we're saying it's doing and so that the
 
05:05:00.590 --> 05:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
layperson can have uh transparency into
 
05:05:02.750 --> 05:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
what the code is actually doing
 
05:05:05.090 --> 05:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
and you know keeping that in sync
 
05:05:08.448 --> 05:05:08.458 align:start position:0%
so consumer protection and then also
 
05:05:10.490 --> 05:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
um you know registering with the state
 
05:05:12.890 --> 05:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
so we have some kind of record some kind
 
05:05:15.650 --> 05:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
of way to you know reach out and
 
05:05:18.770 --> 05:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
understand who and what and you know a
 
05:05:20.270 --> 05:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
dow is doing
 
05:05:22.070 --> 05:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
that answer your question
 
05:05:25.368 --> 05:05:25.378 align:start position:0%
beginning too thank you okay
 
05:05:27.410 --> 05:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:05:30.170 --> 05:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:31.368 --> 05:05:31.378 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:31.378 --> 05:05:32.810 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

05:05:32.810 --> 05:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:06:07.730 --> 05:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:07.740 --> 05:06:12.128 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:06:12.128 --> 05:06:12.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:14.150 --> 05:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
policy councilor from the Department of
 
05:06:16.610 --> 05:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
Revenue the department does not have a
 
05:06:19.810 --> 05:06:19.820 align:start position:0%
position on this bill however uh when
 
05:06:22.730 --> 05:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
that's because this bill does touch on
 
05:06:25.910 --> 05:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
taxation uh so we did uh we did have a
 
05:06:28.070 --> 05:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
look at it and we have some comments
 
05:06:30.110 --> 05:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
that hopefully the uh the sponsor or the
 
05:06:32.030 --> 05:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
committee may consider uh in terms of
 
05:06:33.650 --> 05:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
clarification additional clarification
 
05:06:36.590 --> 05:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh should the bill be passed
 
05:06:39.530 --> 05:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
um one of the items that was on this
 
05:06:42.410 --> 05:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
bill is in regards to the uh the
 
05:06:46.730 --> 05:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
pass-through taxation of of the profits
 
05:06:52.010 --> 05:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
from the Dao to the members and
 
05:06:54.350 --> 05:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
there's no mention and the bill in
 
05:06:56.330 --> 05:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
regards to what kind of Taxation this is
 
05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh the area assumes that this is
 
05:07:00.770 --> 05:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
relation to business profits or business
 
05:07:05.570 --> 05:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
taxation uh the current tax code and for
 
05:07:09.288 --> 05:07:09.298 align:start position:0%
the business taxes is to treat the uh
 
05:07:11.810 --> 05:07:11.820 align:start position:0%
taxation on an entity level basis as
 
05:07:14.810 --> 05:07:14.820 align:start position:0%
opposed to a pass-through basis so uh if
 
05:07:18.050 --> 05:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
this bill was to pass uh we would hope
 
05:07:19.628 --> 05:07:19.638 align:start position:0%
that there would be additional language
 
05:07:23.030 --> 05:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
that would be amending or additional new
 
05:07:26.930 --> 05:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
language to to supplement what we have
 
05:07:29.810 --> 05:07:29.820 align:start position:0%
currently have for the business taxes to
 
05:07:32.090 --> 05:07:32.100 align:start position:0%
uh to provide more statutory guidance in
 
05:07:34.250 --> 05:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
terms of Taxation on the pass-through
 
05:07:36.830 --> 05:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
pasture basis
 
05:07:39.410 --> 05:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
um the other item that we sort of we
 
05:07:44.208 --> 05:07:44.218 align:start position:0%
notice is that uh there is a discussion
 
05:07:46.070 --> 05:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
on the
 
05:07:46.080 --> 05:07:48.410 align:start position:0%
on the
taxation

05:07:48.410 --> 05:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
taxation
 
05:07:53.510 --> 05:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:56.270 --> 05:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
but that it's calling out uh realized
 
05:07:59.690 --> 05:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
gains so in uh in the proposed RSA
 
05:07:59.700 --> 05:08:03.650 align:start position:0%
gains so in uh in the proposed RSA
302-b21

05:08:03.650 --> 05:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:05.330 --> 05:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
and it states that
 
05:08:10.030 --> 05:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:16.070 --> 05:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:20.570 --> 05:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:22.550 --> 05:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
and so the bill specifically states that
 
05:08:25.490 --> 05:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
the realized gain shall pass through to
 
05:08:28.490 --> 05:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
the Dao's members in proportion of their
 
05:08:30.948 --> 05:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
to their token Holdings
 
05:08:33.770 --> 05:08:33.780 align:start position:0%
um so that language there online 16 and
 
05:08:36.410 --> 05:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
17 it specifically mentions
 
05:08:38.270 --> 05:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
um realized gains but it does not
 
05:08:40.910 --> 05:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
mention any other types of
 
05:08:44.448 --> 05:08:44.458 align:start position:0%
income so it is not clear
 
05:08:46.550 --> 05:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
um if the treatment for other types of
 
05:08:48.470 --> 05:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
what's the other treatment what's the
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
other treatment for the other types of
 
05:08:51.948 --> 05:08:51.958 align:start position:0%
income how is that allocated to the
 
05:08:51.958 --> 05:08:58.010 align:start position:0%
income how is that allocated to the
members

05:08:58.010 --> 05:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:00.410 --> 05:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
and another item on that's on the same
 
05:09:01.990 --> 05:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
section uh for
 
05:09:06.410 --> 05:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:06.420 --> 05:09:10.610 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:09:10.610 --> 05:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:13.490 --> 05:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
so this is where it says that the um
 
05:09:15.670 --> 05:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
that the taxation is on the pass-through
 
05:09:18.230 --> 05:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
basis however
 
05:09:21.470 --> 05:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:25.550 --> 05:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
page five of the bill lines eight and
 
05:09:28.310 --> 05:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
nine that says members shall not be held
 
05:09:31.310 --> 05:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
liable for any obligations incurred by
 
05:09:33.590 --> 05:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
the Dao including but not limited to
 
05:09:36.470 --> 05:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
labor and tax obligations so it appears
 
05:09:36.480 --> 05:09:37.250 align:start position:0%
labor and tax obligations so it appears
that

05:09:37.250 --> 05:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:09:40.150 --> 05:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
it might be in contradiction with the
 
05:09:44.030 --> 05:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:47.090 --> 05:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
um and um those those were the items
 
05:09:48.350 --> 05:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
that we noticed and if there were any
 
05:09:49.970 --> 05:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
questions I'll be
 
05:09:53.990 --> 05:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:58.430 --> 05:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative sphere
 
05:10:03.350 --> 05:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
I at the end of the um see in
 
05:10:05.208 --> 05:10:05.218 align:start position:0%
methodology I guess that's I don't have
 
05:10:07.128 --> 05:10:07.138 align:start position:0%
a page number but it's in the
 
05:10:10.550 --> 05:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:13.010 --> 05:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
and it says the department anticipates
 
05:10:14.868 --> 05:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
that an indeterminal number of New
 
05:10:16.368 --> 05:10:16.378 align:start position:0%
Hampshire companies that are currently
 
05:10:17.868 --> 05:10:17.878 align:start position:0%
registered with the Department of State
 
05:10:20.270 --> 05:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
and they file annual reports would now
 
05:10:22.730 --> 05:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
qualify as a dow this would result in an
 
05:10:24.948 --> 05:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
indeterminate loss of federal of general
 
05:10:27.410 --> 05:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
fund revenues from annual report filing
 
05:10:29.930 --> 05:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
fees can you tell me what the basis for
 
05:10:32.030 --> 05:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
that comment is
 
05:10:39.708 --> 05:10:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:42.110 --> 05:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
is it uh excuse me is it on the last
 
05:10:49.610 --> 05:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:52.128 --> 05:10:52.138 align:start position:0%
under methodology
 
05:11:00.110 --> 05:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:00.120 --> 05:11:13.310 align:start position:0%
 
just

05:11:13.310 --> 05:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:16.310 --> 05:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
I believe this is not from our comment
 
05:11:21.230 --> 05:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:24.530 --> 05:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
yeah the the that last sentence
 
05:11:26.590 --> 05:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
this will result in an indeterminable
 
05:11:28.730 --> 05:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
indeterminable loss of general fund
 
05:11:31.550 --> 05:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
revenues from annual report filing fees
 
05:11:39.350 --> 05:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:42.820 --> 05:11:42.830 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:11:42.830 --> 05:11:44.150 align:start position:0%
any other questions

pleasure of serving with representative
 
05:12:56.330 --> 05:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
Ammon as the chair of the governor's
 
05:12:59.690 --> 05:12:59.700 align:start position:0%
commission to study cryptocurrency and
 
05:13:04.970 --> 05:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
digital assets and issues like these new
 
05:13:08.030 --> 05:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
structures that have been addressed and
 
05:13:11.270 --> 05:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
very well explained that commission
 
05:13:14.090 --> 05:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
provided its final report
 
05:13:17.090 --> 05:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
to the governor and to the speaker and
 
05:13:19.610 --> 05:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
to the Senate President and others in
 
05:13:24.830 --> 05:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
the State uh just at the end of 2022 and
 
05:13:28.970 --> 05:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
I have a copy for the record of this
 
05:13:31.070 --> 05:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
hearing that I will leave with the
 
05:13:33.230 --> 05:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
committee along with a copy of the
 
05:13:35.750 --> 05:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
governor's press release where he
 
05:13:37.670 --> 05:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
described the acceptance of the
 
05:13:39.830 --> 05:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
commitment commission's report the
 
05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
commission addressed for a year
 
05:13:45.288 --> 05:13:45.298 align:start position:0%
many of the questions that you have
 
05:13:48.708 --> 05:13:48.718 align:start position:0%
already been asking and during that year
 
05:13:53.930 --> 05:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
the commission reached a report with 12
 
05:13:58.448 --> 05:13:58.458 align:start position:0%
recommendations and that report was
 
05:14:00.650 --> 05:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
unanimously approved where we had
 
05:14:03.230 --> 05:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
members that were technically proficient
 
05:14:06.708 --> 05:14:06.718 align:start position:0%
like representative Ammon we had members
 
05:14:10.070 --> 05:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
like me a lawyer and I'll explain a
 
05:14:11.270 --> 05:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
similar analysis to answer
 
05:14:14.390 --> 05:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs question uh who had
 
05:14:16.368 --> 05:14:16.378 align:start position:0%
had a lot of experience with things like
 
05:14:16.378 --> 05:14:17.590 align:start position:0%
had a lot of experience with things like
trusts

05:14:17.590 --> 05:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
trusts
 
05:14:20.930 --> 05:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
like limited liability companies and
 
05:14:23.150 --> 05:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
like development of economic development
 
05:14:26.150 --> 05:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire when I participated in
 
05:14:28.128 --> 05:14:28.138 align:start position:0%
the early 90s revising the business
 
05:14:30.650 --> 05:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
finance authorities structure I've been
 
05:14:32.628 --> 05:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
around this committee a long time as a
 
05:14:35.750 --> 05:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
matter of fact when I was in college I
 
05:14:39.170 --> 05:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
was at 19 I was elected to this house
 
05:14:41.868 --> 05:14:41.878 align:start position:0%
from the towns of Cornish and Croydon
 
05:14:43.850 --> 05:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
and I I served on the Ways and Means
 
05:14:46.550 --> 05:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
Committee so it's wonderful to to have
 
05:14:49.610 --> 05:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
since 1989 lived back in New Hampshire
 
05:14:52.250 --> 05:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
and had this the experiences I've had
 
05:14:53.930 --> 05:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
including this one
 
05:14:57.530 --> 05:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
it's so important to uh refer to the
 
05:15:00.650 --> 05:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
question of why this is important and
 
05:15:03.708 --> 05:15:03.718 align:start position:0%
and they the commission after studying
 
05:15:07.010 --> 05:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
this came to three fundamental findings
 
05:15:11.890 --> 05:15:11.900 align:start position:0%
one that blockchain technology
 
05:15:13.970 --> 05:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
explained in the ways that
 
05:15:13.980 --> 05:15:15.350 align:start position:0%
explained in the ways that
representative

05:15:15.350 --> 05:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:15:20.868 --> 05:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
bilio filio filio said uh that it is
 
05:15:20.878 --> 05:15:21.948 align:start position:0%
bilio filio filio said uh that it is
real

05:15:21.948 --> 05:15:21.958 align:start position:0%
real
 
05:15:25.788 --> 05:15:25.798 align:start position:0%
it is something important in other words
 
05:15:28.430 --> 05:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative Terry my guess is back in
 
05:15:31.070 --> 05:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
the 60s when the defense department
 
05:15:34.010 --> 05:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
developed the Internet and computers
 
05:15:37.490 --> 05:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
started to connect for the first time in
 
05:15:40.250 --> 05:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
the 60s and 70s this was long before the
 
05:15:43.490 --> 05:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
World Wide Web became apparent with
 
05:15:46.250 --> 05:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
images and visuals that helped explain
 
05:15:50.590 --> 05:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
it at that time uh it was a New Concept
 
05:15:55.070 --> 05:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
but there were some states with their
 
05:15:57.770 --> 05:15:57.780 align:start position:0%
legal systems and governments Federal
 
05:16:00.770 --> 05:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
National governments that took steps to
 
05:16:03.890 --> 05:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
build the legal infrastructure required
 
05:16:07.310 --> 05:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
to allow Innovation and to allow
 
05:16:10.490 --> 05:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
protection of consumers investors and
 
05:16:13.310 --> 05:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
others this commission concluded that
 
05:16:16.610 --> 05:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
this is a real technology and regardless
 
05:16:20.510 --> 05:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
of today's papers vicissitudes of how
 
05:16:23.330 --> 05:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
the technology is going with certain
 
05:16:26.208 --> 05:16:26.218 align:start position:0%
businesses or otherwise our conclusion
 
05:16:29.810 --> 05:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
was this is going to be real and it
 
05:16:31.910 --> 05:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
offers potentially very important
 
05:16:34.810 --> 05:16:34.820 align:start position:0%
promises that could benefit Humanity
 
05:16:37.490 --> 05:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
like the internet
 
05:16:39.770 --> 05:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
has come to show even though the
 
05:16:42.708 --> 05:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
internet has a lot of cons too the fact
 
05:16:45.170 --> 05:16:45.180 align:start position:0%
is it's changing our society and it was
 
05:16:47.510 --> 05:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
important for this legislature as well
 
05:16:49.730 --> 05:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
as other law making bodies even though
 
05:16:53.270 --> 05:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
people may not technically be right on
 
05:16:54.830 --> 05:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
top of the issues right at the beginning
 
05:16:58.010 --> 05:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
there are some legislators who are and
 
05:16:59.750 --> 05:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
that leadership allows a legal
 
05:17:01.788 --> 05:17:01.798 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to be built the second
 
05:17:04.730 --> 05:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
finding we came to was that the current
 
05:17:06.470 --> 05:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
legal system
 
05:17:08.690 --> 05:17:08.700 align:start position:0%
at the federal level at the national
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
level at at the international level and
 
05:17:14.448 --> 05:17:14.458 align:start position:0%
at the state level is uncertain it's not
 
05:17:18.350 --> 05:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
right for The Unique attributes of this
 
05:17:21.050 --> 05:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
new technology that uncertainty is
 
05:17:24.890 --> 05:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
undermining two related things one
 
05:17:28.310 --> 05:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
innovation Economic Development
 
05:17:31.788 --> 05:17:31.798 align:start position:0%
it's undermining that two it we had
 
05:17:34.250 --> 05:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
participants from Aid state agencies on
 
05:17:36.708 --> 05:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
our commission it is undermining the
 
05:17:39.890 --> 05:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
ability of agencies
 
05:17:42.070 --> 05:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
to enforce
 
05:17:44.590 --> 05:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
laws that are designed to protect
 
05:17:48.230 --> 05:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
consumers and investors so number two we
 
05:17:50.208 --> 05:17:50.218 align:start position:0%
found uncertainty in the legal regime
 
05:17:54.050 --> 05:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
and we said that's not good for a couple
 
05:17:56.690 --> 05:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
of reasons that economic development but
 
05:17:58.550 --> 05:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
also protecting consumers and investors
 
05:18:02.868 --> 05:18:02.878 align:start position:0%
the final major finding we came to was
 
05:18:06.890 --> 05:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
uh that New Hampshire as a state
 
05:18:11.110 --> 05:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
should take a leading role in developing
 
05:18:14.930 --> 05:18:14.940 align:start position:0%
certainty and developing Innovations in
 
05:18:18.708 --> 05:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
our legal system that will support the
 
05:18:18.718 --> 05:18:19.850 align:start position:0%
our legal system that will support the
positive

05:18:19.850 --> 05:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
positive
 
05:18:22.730 --> 05:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
stable good development of this
 
05:18:26.330 --> 05:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
technology and hopefully reap the
 
05:18:30.770 --> 05:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
benefits of having a message out in the
 
05:18:33.170 --> 05:18:33.180 align:start position:0%
economy that this is a forward-looking
 
05:18:35.990 --> 05:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
state this state drafts good laws that
 
05:18:39.230 --> 05:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
are modern and balanced and we want to
 
05:18:41.448 --> 05:18:41.458 align:start position:0%
be in that state because they understand
 
05:18:44.270 --> 05:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
what we need in order to innovate and go
 
05:18:47.270 --> 05:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
forward those were our three findings on
 
05:18:49.850 --> 05:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
this when we make 12 specific
 
05:18:52.128 --> 05:18:52.138 align:start position:0%
recommendations the questions that
 
05:18:55.670 --> 05:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
you're asking are exactly the ones that
 
05:18:57.948 --> 05:18:57.958 align:start position:0%
came up in our commission the confusion
 
05:19:00.470 --> 05:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert that you are have
 
05:19:03.050 --> 05:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
expressed and I've heard you with your
 
05:19:07.250 --> 05:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
with the light on this is new it same
 
05:19:09.708 --> 05:19:09.718 align:start position:0%
thing happened to me uh on this
 
05:19:12.190 --> 05:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
commission but what we ended up
 
05:19:14.270 --> 05:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
recommending is the very first
 
05:19:16.490 --> 05:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
recommendation was New Hampshire should
 
05:19:21.530 --> 05:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
adopt a law that establishes legal
 
05:19:25.510 --> 05:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
status for these distributed or
 
05:19:28.628 --> 05:19:28.638 align:start position:0%
decentralized Enterprises organization
 
05:19:32.810 --> 05:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
that are right now proliferating out on
 
05:19:35.390 --> 05:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
the internet they are alive they're
 
05:19:39.288 --> 05:19:39.298 align:start position:0%
happening but it's so uncertain that the
 
05:19:42.890 --> 05:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
state who takes the creative lead role
 
05:19:45.830 --> 05:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
in building this infrastructure is going
 
05:19:49.128 --> 05:19:49.138 align:start position:0%
to see benefits that's the view of this
 
05:19:51.770 --> 05:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
commission the governor thanked us for
 
05:19:54.170 --> 05:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
our our work and also said we should
 
05:19:55.490 --> 05:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
work together to get these
 
05:19:58.128 --> 05:19:58.138 align:start position:0%
recommendations done to it is a credit
 
05:20:00.410 --> 05:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
to representative Ammon that he
 
05:20:03.350 --> 05:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill this bill is not
 
05:20:07.070 --> 05:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
the final answer when I came before as a
 
05:20:10.730 --> 05:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
lobbyist before this Committee in the
 
05:20:12.470 --> 05:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
and representative hunt was the chair
 
05:20:17.270 --> 05:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
then too in the early in early 2000s to
 
05:20:21.550 --> 05:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
propose an 80 to 90 page
 
05:20:24.288 --> 05:20:24.298 align:start position:0%
modernization of our trust laws trust
 
05:20:26.868 --> 05:20:26.878 align:start position:0%
laws that were created in some cases in
 
05:20:30.830 --> 05:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
the 1600s we worked very hard with
 
05:20:33.650 --> 05:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
subcommittees with committed members in
 
05:20:36.110 --> 05:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
both the house and the Senate and we did
 
05:20:39.230 --> 05:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
achieve enactment of those laws and
 
05:20:42.410 --> 05:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
right now if you travel around the world
 
05:20:45.288 --> 05:20:45.298 align:start position:0%
around this country people will say that
 
05:20:48.830 --> 05:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
this is a leading state to protect your
 
05:20:51.850 --> 05:20:51.860 align:start position:0%
family to establish trust for your pet
 
05:20:54.288 --> 05:20:54.298 align:start position:0%
uh if you because other states don't
 
05:20:57.470 --> 05:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
permit that we were a leader and it's
 
05:21:01.250 --> 05:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
it's been it's attracted families and
 
05:21:05.270 --> 05:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
developments to this state my uh my hope
 
05:21:08.390 --> 05:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
is that that the passion that you hear
 
05:21:10.128 --> 05:21:10.138 align:start position:0%
me speaking with as chair of this
 
05:21:13.250 --> 05:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
commission I'm 62 years old and I
 
05:21:15.050 --> 05:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
undertook this on a voluntary basis
 
05:21:17.930 --> 05:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
after request of the governor and I
 
05:21:19.788 --> 05:21:19.798 align:start position:0%
loved working with everyone on that
 
05:21:21.708 --> 05:21:21.718 align:start position:0%
commission it was a wonderful experience
 
05:21:24.410 --> 05:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
is that this committee will take that
 
05:21:27.530 --> 05:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
important step on this bill
 
05:21:31.368 --> 05:21:31.378 align:start position:0%
to establish the working group that is
 
05:21:34.208 --> 05:21:34.218 align:start position:0%
necessary to build the creative answer
 
05:21:37.788 --> 05:21:37.798 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon did not start with
 
05:21:40.310 --> 05:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
Wyoming's approach which has been panned
 
05:21:44.390 --> 05:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
because it's legally not really
 
05:21:47.628 --> 05:21:47.638 align:start position:0%
consistent with what is happening out in
 
05:21:50.448 --> 05:21:50.458 align:start position:0%
the wild and and he started with an
 
05:21:53.270 --> 05:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
academic leadership uh position that
 
05:21:56.930 --> 05:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
hopefully this hearing today will send
 
05:22:00.110 --> 05:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
the signal to the world that's
 
05:22:01.670 --> 05:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
developing out there that has a
 
05:22:03.948 --> 05:22:03.958 align:start position:0%
capitalization that is growing and it's
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
up and down but just like the internet
 
05:22:09.350 --> 05:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
was you know remember pets.com it goes
 
05:22:11.510 --> 05:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
up and down but look at what it is today
 
05:22:15.590 --> 05:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
our most important economic companies
 
05:22:17.750 --> 05:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
our tech companies working with the
 
05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
internet and so my urge to the committee
 
05:22:24.410 --> 05:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
my ask my my respectful request is that
 
05:22:27.050 --> 05:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
you move forward with this bill to make
 
05:22:29.690 --> 05:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
it better to develop an amendment that
 
05:22:31.670 --> 05:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
addresses the questions you're asking I
 
05:22:33.730 --> 05:22:33.740 align:start position:0%
promise you that I will be participating
 
05:22:37.070 --> 05:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
in that effort as a member of the public
 
05:22:40.368 --> 05:22:40.378 align:start position:0%
and I hope it is very important that
 
05:22:42.350 --> 05:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
this bill go forward I would like to
 
05:22:44.690 --> 05:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
finally address quickly
 
05:22:47.868 --> 05:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
the the question of tax I wanted to say
 
05:22:50.330 --> 05:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
back in the early 90s I was there one of
 
05:22:52.250 --> 05:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
the there's a specific recommendation on
 
05:22:56.330 --> 05:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
tax that would uh apply and I will I
 
05:22:58.910 --> 05:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
will work with the dra on that it is in
 
05:23:01.070 --> 05:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
fact where organizations are serving as
 
05:23:03.110 --> 05:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
Financial intermediaries alone they get
 
05:23:04.430 --> 05:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
the same treatment that our business
 
05:23:05.868 --> 05:23:05.878 align:start position:0%
profit Stacks our business Enterprise
 
05:23:08.690 --> 05:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
tag already provides to other Financial
 
05:23:11.030 --> 05:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
intermediary entities and I know that
 
05:23:13.070 --> 05:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
because I was a lobbyist I wrote those
 
05:23:14.990 --> 05:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
rules and it was enacted in this
 
05:23:18.170 --> 05:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
legislature so that's the intent of the
 
05:23:20.448 --> 05:23:20.458 align:start position:0%
the you know the uh that there's
 
05:23:23.270 --> 05:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations I urge each of you
 
05:23:25.128 --> 05:23:25.138 align:start position:0%
well the great thing is I'm looking at
 
05:23:27.590 --> 05:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative Terry's comment we took
 
05:23:30.288 --> 05:23:30.298 align:start position:0%
the time it's the first report across
 
05:23:32.810 --> 05:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
the country that tried to build a set of
 
05:23:35.570 --> 05:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
plain language definitions for each of
 
05:23:37.190 --> 05:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
the concepts that representative Ammon
 
05:23:40.190 --> 05:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
was Raising uh I urge you to take a look
 
05:23:43.190 --> 05:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
at it and to participate uh in
 
05:23:44.990 --> 05:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
criticizing it and making it better
 
05:23:45.000 --> 05:23:46.670 align:start position:0%
criticizing it and making it better
because

05:23:46.670 --> 05:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:23:49.788 --> 05:23:49.798 align:start position:0%
this bill one of the things it does is
 
05:23:52.310 --> 05:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
it requires organizations that are going
 
05:23:54.230 --> 05:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
to go out there alive and attract
 
05:23:56.570 --> 05:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
participants regular people with
 
05:23:59.030 --> 05:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
computers around the world who connect
 
05:24:00.708 --> 05:24:00.718 align:start position:0%
to the internet that you have to use
 
05:24:03.948 --> 05:24:03.958 align:start position:0%
plain language in describing your
 
05:24:06.170 --> 05:24:06.180 align:start position:0%
operating rules your voting requirements
 
05:24:08.990 --> 05:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
your governance issues that is an
 
05:24:11.208 --> 05:24:11.218 align:start position:0%
innovation in the legal system that we
 
05:24:13.970 --> 05:24:13.980 align:start position:0%
hope will be part of a final bill I
 
05:24:17.930 --> 05:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for the chance uh uh Mr chair
 
05:24:20.690 --> 05:24:20.700 align:start position:0%
of this commission committee for the to
 
05:24:23.628 --> 05:24:23.638 align:start position:0%
take a shot an initial shot at this and
 
05:24:26.810 --> 05:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
I urge this commission committee to make
 
05:24:29.390 --> 05:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
sure this Bill gets a good look at in a
 
05:24:31.610 --> 05:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
nice working group like I know has often
 
05:24:33.530 --> 05:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
been the case in the Commerce Committee
 
05:24:35.390 --> 05:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
thank you sir and I'd be happy to answer
 
05:24:36.770 --> 05:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:24:38.868 --> 05:24:38.878 align:start position:0%
Mr Andrew thank you for your testimony
 
05:24:41.030 --> 05:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
it was extremely enlightening
 
05:24:44.448 --> 05:24:44.458 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
05:24:48.890 --> 05:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:48.900 --> 05:24:50.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:24:50.350 --> 05:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:25:01.850 --> 05:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:04.070 --> 05:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm you know but I don't I'm not
 
05:25:06.830 --> 05:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
a machine what is what Ammon what did
 
05:25:08.750 --> 05:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
you say machine code reader or something
 
05:25:10.610 --> 05:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
like that I didn't even know what that
 
05:25:13.788 --> 05:25:13.798 align:start position:0%
meant and I still don't but I'm a little
 
05:25:16.190 --> 05:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh I'm a little skeptical
 
05:25:21.170 --> 05:25:21.180 align:start position:0%
just by nature and I have noticed that
 
05:25:23.390 --> 05:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of pro here
 
05:25:25.510 --> 05:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
and almost no con
 
05:25:28.788 --> 05:25:28.798 align:start position:0%
and so I find that to be out of balance
 
05:25:31.910 --> 05:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
and and I'm surprised by it because this
 
05:25:36.530 --> 05:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
is very very uh different
 
05:25:41.868 --> 05:25:41.878 align:start position:0%
and and so I'm just expressing my my uh
 
05:25:45.890 --> 05:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
inability to I think I think the
 
05:25:48.230 --> 05:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
question is no would you believe we are
 
05:25:51.110 --> 05:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
not getting a a fair and balanced
 
05:25:52.868 --> 05:25:52.878 align:start position:0%
presentation that's a comment
 
05:25:56.150 --> 05:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
would you believe no well I don't
 
05:25:59.208 --> 05:25:59.218 align:start position:0%
believe I don't do that gentlemen we're
 
05:26:01.930 --> 05:26:01.940 align:start position:0%
not here to disparage the witnesses
 
05:26:04.730 --> 05:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not disparaging not at all you're
 
05:26:06.050 --> 05:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
judging that you're judging the
 
05:26:09.190 --> 05:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
testimony as being unfair and and
 
05:26:11.868 --> 05:26:11.878 align:start position:0%
dishonest and that's not what we're
 
05:26:13.850 --> 05:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
doing no I did not mean to imply this
 
05:26:17.270 --> 05:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:19.628 --> 05:26:19.638 align:start position:0%
just kidding
 
05:26:22.610 --> 05:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
I'm sure I would just like to say I
 
05:26:26.448 --> 05:26:26.458 align:start position:0%
don't take anything uh at verse from the
 
05:26:28.490 --> 05:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
comments in fact legislators are
 
05:26:31.850 --> 05:26:31.860 align:start position:0%
supposed to be skeptical I was even
 
05:26:34.128 --> 05:26:34.138 align:start position:0%
though I was 19 years old when I was in
 
05:26:36.230 --> 05:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
here representative Herbert
 
05:26:40.490 --> 05:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
uh in your lifetime you have seen things
 
05:26:43.930 --> 05:26:43.940 align:start position:0%
move from uh
 
05:26:48.590 --> 05:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
albums to CDs you have seen things
 
05:26:52.368 --> 05:26:52.378 align:start position:0%
before that the original internet you
 
05:26:54.230 --> 05:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
would have been very skeptical of
 
05:26:57.530 --> 05:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
because it was communicating without any
 
05:26:59.270 --> 05:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
kind of Assistance or graphical
 
05:27:02.150 --> 05:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
interface right now you turn on your
 
05:27:05.868 --> 05:27:05.878 align:start position:0%
computer and you can go to look at what
 
05:27:08.030 --> 05:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
that vacation spot might look like that
 
05:27:10.850 --> 05:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
you and your family may be going to I
 
05:27:12.590 --> 05:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
would urge you to be skeptical
 
05:27:15.350 --> 05:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert but I would urge
 
05:27:18.550 --> 05:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
you also to listen to the possibility
 
05:27:21.110 --> 05:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire may have an
 
05:27:23.930 --> 05:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity here and that's what I think
 
05:27:27.288 --> 05:27:27.298 align:start position:0%
I would suggest uh number one I think
 
05:27:29.030 --> 05:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
you should be skeptical but number two
 
05:27:30.830 --> 05:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
There's an opportunity here for people
 
05:27:33.410 --> 05:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
who studied this for a whole year that's
 
05:27:36.050 --> 05:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
their conclusion and I and we urge you
 
05:27:41.990 --> 05:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
to participate with us no thank you
 
05:27:44.628 --> 05:27:44.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative uh Mr
 
05:27:48.050 --> 05:27:48.060 align:start position:0%
ardinger would you believe that I in
 
05:27:51.470 --> 05:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
another lifetime had a node on the
 
05:27:51.480 --> 05:27:53.270 align:start position:0%
another lifetime had a node on the
arpanet

05:27:53.270 --> 05:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
arpanet
 
05:27:55.550 --> 05:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
I know exactly what you're talking about
 
05:27:59.030 --> 05:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
yes sir that's that's that's the
 
05:28:01.730 --> 05:28:01.740 align:start position:0%
beginning that was the beginning and I
 
05:28:04.310 --> 05:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
worked at digital yep that oh fantastic
 
05:28:06.830 --> 05:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
I represented digital when they were
 
05:28:09.530 --> 05:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
here okay thank you very much thank you
 
05:28:12.530 --> 05:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
this was very interesting I appreciate
 
05:28:16.310 --> 05:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
it and I have no more pink cards uh blue
 
05:28:20.150 --> 05:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
sheet I have three yeses and right now
 
05:28:22.368 --> 05:28:22.378 align:start position:0%
HP 645
 
05:28:24.770 --> 05:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
I had submitted a pink card sir I did
 
05:28:26.690 --> 05:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
have never seen it uh did you see a lot
 
05:28:30.948 --> 05:28:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:32.628 --> 05:28:32.638 align:start position:0%
Tim Connolly
 
05:28:34.970 --> 05:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
put a Secretary of State's office yes
 
05:28:36.650 --> 05:28:36.660 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that's quite all right sir
 
05:28:38.510 --> 05:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I'll be very
 
05:28:40.690 --> 05:28:40.700 align:start position:0%
brief um oh thank you um
 
05:28:43.670 --> 05:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh since the Secretary of State the
 
05:28:45.830 --> 05:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is not named in the
 
05:28:46.910 --> 05:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
bill that's to say if we have no
 
05:28:48.470 --> 05:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
existing responsibilities a role in
 
05:28:51.350 --> 05:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 645 is written but as you all
 
05:28:53.570 --> 05:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
indicated those are the states I have
 
05:28:55.910 --> 05:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
worked on daos one thing they also in
 
05:28:57.230 --> 05:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
common is they've tried to develop a
 
05:28:59.628 --> 05:28:59.638 align:start position:0%
legal structure that allows that Dao to
 
05:29:01.850 --> 05:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
be to be to be formed and that's to say
 
05:29:04.730 --> 05:29:04.740 align:start position:0%
is either to form like the LLC or for
 
05:29:06.230 --> 05:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
example the state of Colorado they found
 
05:29:09.470 --> 05:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
that this uh consumer cooperatives which
 
05:29:10.850 --> 05:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has this law that permit
 
05:29:13.010 --> 05:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
said as well is also a similar format
 
05:29:14.510 --> 05:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
that that's advantageous to a
 
05:29:17.570 --> 05:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
decentralized manner of organization so
 
05:29:18.948 --> 05:29:18.958 align:start position:0%
um we certainly you're you know have a
 
05:29:20.208 --> 05:29:20.218 align:start position:0%
reason to be excited about the
 
05:29:23.090 --> 05:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
possibility again but as the sponsor as
 
05:29:26.030 --> 05:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
well as uh uh Mr under indicated there's
 
05:29:27.650 --> 05:29:27.660 align:start position:0%
a lot of potential opportunity here as
 
05:29:28.610 --> 05:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
you say that there are several states
 
05:29:29.868 --> 05:29:29.878 align:start position:0%
that have been taking the crack at this
 
05:29:31.670 --> 05:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
over the last several years and each
 
05:29:32.570 --> 05:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
taking somewhat different approach
 
05:29:35.030 --> 05:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
coaches and certainly that the fact that
 
05:29:36.530 --> 05:29:36.540 align:start position:0%
if we if the temperature is going to
 
05:29:39.288 --> 05:29:39.298 align:start position:0%
adopt um that legislation there will be
 
05:29:40.788 --> 05:29:40.798 align:start position:0%
a necessity for it to have a legal
 
05:29:42.830 --> 05:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
structure whether it be a daoba separate
 
05:29:45.170 --> 05:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
legal entity type of its own or whether
 
05:29:48.050 --> 05:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
we modify the LLC or Corporation laws
 
05:29:49.550 --> 05:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
with changes that allow for that
 
05:29:52.730 --> 05:29:52.740 align:start position:0%
decentralized or type of mechanism but
 
05:29:54.530 --> 05:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
certainly we will be excited to work
 
05:29:55.850 --> 05:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
with the committee if they're going to
 
05:29:57.530 --> 05:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee to identify what
 
05:29:59.090 --> 05:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
those requirements might be so that
 
05:30:00.590 --> 05:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
they've made certain requirements for
 
05:30:01.910 --> 05:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
example like representative Helio
 
05:30:04.430 --> 05:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned that like LSA form is an LLC
 
05:30:05.810 --> 05:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
then they will have a registered agent
 
05:30:07.070 --> 05:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
where they can be found where Services
 
05:30:09.350 --> 05:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
process could be delivered uh they'd
 
05:30:10.730 --> 05:30:10.740 align:start position:0%
have to file in a report to indicate
 
05:30:13.190 --> 05:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
that they have paid their fees that they
 
05:30:14.750 --> 05:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
are still active and in business so
 
05:30:16.368 --> 05:30:16.378 align:start position:0%
these are the type of things that I'm
 
05:30:18.590 --> 05:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
looking at consumer issue protection for
 
05:30:21.288 --> 05:30:21.298 align:start position:0%
uh the laws that manage the responsible
 
05:30:22.910 --> 05:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
for existing businesses that certainly
 
05:30:25.250 --> 05:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
we want to see and expect in a statute
 
05:30:27.470 --> 05:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
that will govern daos I'd be happy to
 
05:30:28.730 --> 05:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
answer any questions but otherwise I
 
05:30:30.470 --> 05:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
just mentioned say that the current bill
 
05:30:32.330 --> 05:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't require us to do anything
 
05:30:34.128 --> 05:30:34.138 align:start position:0%
um and that's unlikely that you'd form
 
05:30:35.690 --> 05:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
an entity where you wouldn't be like
 
05:30:37.670 --> 05:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
public filing where people could
 
05:30:40.550 --> 05:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
um view the uh the organization and see
 
05:30:42.830 --> 05:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
that it'd be certain requirements um in
 
05:30:43.970 --> 05:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
order for them to transact business
 
05:30:43.980 --> 05:30:45.730 align:start position:0%
order for them to transact business
thanks

05:30:45.730 --> 05:30:45.740 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
05:30:48.110 --> 05:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
05:30:50.990 --> 05:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much thank you Tom
 
05:30:53.330 --> 05:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to testify
 
05:30:58.150 --> 05:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:12.070 --> 05:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:16.128 --> 05:31:16.138 align:start position:0%

[Music]

05:31:55.128 --> 05:31:55.138 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:31:58.070 --> 05:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
last year they had they had they had all
 
05:32:00.170 --> 05:32:00.180 align:start position:0%
the tables you know
 
05:32:03.650 --> 05:32:03.660 align:start position:0%
yeah we know together that was so that
 
05:32:05.510 --> 05:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
was so ridiculous the way they ended
 
05:32:07.490 --> 05:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
give me room configured that was
 
05:32:07.500 --> 05:32:14.628 align:start position:0%
give me room configured that was
ridiculous

05:32:14.628 --> 05:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:14.638 --> 05:32:30.890 align:start position:0%
 
experience

05:32:30.890 --> 05:32:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:30.900 --> 05:32:31.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:32:31.730 --> 05:32:31.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:32:31.740 --> 05:33:02.030 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

05:33:02.030 --> 05:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:13.930 --> 05:33:13.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:18.350 --> 05:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
all right so um I guess everyone got at
 
05:33:20.750 --> 05:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
eight o'clock last night or so uh got
 
05:33:23.690 --> 05:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
something emailed them
 
05:33:25.010 --> 05:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
um I unfortunately never got it because
 
05:33:27.610 --> 05:33:27.620 align:start position:0%
it was in my junk mail
 
05:33:30.590 --> 05:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
I know and that other thing from
 
05:33:32.510 --> 05:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday that was that showed up in my
 
05:33:34.010 --> 05:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
junk mail that was in my junk mail too
 
05:33:37.430 --> 05:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's why I didn't get it so
 
05:33:40.610 --> 05:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
and uh unfortunately I'm getting too
 
05:33:44.390 --> 05:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
many emails so as it is it's I'm getting
 
05:33:47.208 --> 05:33:47.218 align:start position:0%
close to a thousand emails a day and
 
05:33:49.310 --> 05:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
where they all come from is hard hard to
 
05:33:50.930 --> 05:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
imagine but
 
05:33:56.208 --> 05:33:56.218 align:start position:0%
um it's yeah right so
 
05:33:58.368 --> 05:33:58.378 align:start position:0%
and then and then so a fair chunk of
 
05:34:01.190 --> 05:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
them end up all right so
 
05:34:02.930 --> 05:34:02.940 align:start position:0%
um let everybody know what we're gonna
 
05:34:05.208 --> 05:34:05.218 align:start position:0%
do I'm not gonna spend too much time on
 
05:34:07.070 --> 05:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
this today
 
05:34:07.080 --> 05:34:07.670 align:start position:0%
this today
um

05:34:07.670 --> 05:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:10.970 --> 05:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
because the way I've scheduled it is
 
05:34:14.390 --> 05:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
that next Tuesday we're having a session
 
05:34:18.230 --> 05:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
so after session we will come back and
 
05:34:20.810 --> 05:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
uh we'll do do a little bit of
 
05:34:22.010 --> 05:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
subcommittee then
 
05:34:25.490 --> 05:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
I have scheduled for Wednesday morning a
 
05:34:28.670 --> 05:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee along with a subcommittee
 
05:34:31.610 --> 05:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
of the other several other bills that
 
05:34:33.230 --> 05:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
we've already had the subcommittee once
 
05:34:34.850 --> 05:34:34.860 align:start position:0%
but if you remember there's a couple I
 
05:34:37.310 --> 05:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
said we'll take this up later okay so
 
05:34:41.410 --> 05:34:41.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:43.910 --> 05:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
that number I'm you know I started to
 
05:34:47.150 --> 05:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
remember numbers slowly but
 
05:34:50.090 --> 05:34:50.100 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
05:34:50.100 --> 05:34:50.750 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

05:34:50.750 --> 05:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:52.970 --> 05:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
uh that did we have because we have
 
05:34:56.090 --> 05:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
eight early bills so we'll take finish
 
05:34:57.650 --> 05:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
up those subcommittees and then we'll
 
05:35:00.890 --> 05:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
have some more discussion on this bill
 
05:35:03.050 --> 05:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
um and if it's ready at that time then
 
05:35:06.948 --> 05:35:06.958 align:start position:0%
we can exec it on Wednesday and if not
 
05:35:10.190 --> 05:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
then Thursday which is D-Day where we
 
05:35:12.170 --> 05:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
have to have everything done
 
05:35:15.050 --> 05:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
um that that day will be opened up for
 
05:35:16.850 --> 05:35:16.860 align:start position:0%
the whole day for us to figure it out
 
05:35:19.250 --> 05:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
okay okay so
 
05:35:21.110 --> 05:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
um in terms of where we're at in this
 
05:35:21.120 --> 05:35:22.430 align:start position:0%
um in terms of where we're at in this
bill

05:35:22.430 --> 05:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:35:25.970 --> 05:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
um obviously I I just got finally just
 
05:35:28.670 --> 05:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
get it and then unfortunately we have no
 
05:35:32.750 --> 05:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
no red printers no you know red ink
 
05:35:34.430 --> 05:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
um and for those of you who got it you
 
05:35:36.050 --> 05:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
probably noticed that they did some
 
05:35:38.270 --> 05:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
stuff in red ink which means when you
 
05:35:41.628 --> 05:35:41.638 align:start position:0%
when I got it printed here it's um it
 
05:35:44.030 --> 05:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
was gray not red
 
05:35:45.770 --> 05:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
um I I have shaking down one of the
 
05:35:48.948 --> 05:35:48.958 align:start position:0%
lobbyists for a red version uh so I do
 
05:35:52.250 --> 05:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
have the red version however I before I
 
05:35:55.190 --> 05:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
get too deeply into going through this
 
05:35:57.770 --> 05:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
whole thing I wanted to have the Liquor
 
05:36:00.050 --> 05:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
Commission review it so that will be the
 
05:36:01.550 --> 05:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
first primaries to have the Liquor
 
05:36:02.990 --> 05:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
Commission and go through the whole
 
05:36:06.170 --> 05:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
thing however having said that there is
 
05:36:08.448 --> 05:36:08.458 align:start position:0%
a couple of things that I have right now
 
05:36:11.628 --> 05:36:11.638 align:start position:0%
the block have kind of noticed and so we
 
05:36:14.150 --> 05:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
can discuss those and then we can take
 
05:36:17.208 --> 05:36:17.218 align:start position:0%
up the rest of it
 
05:36:18.650 --> 05:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
come next Tuesday
 
05:36:21.010 --> 05:36:21.020 align:start position:0%
so first page
 
05:36:23.930 --> 05:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
this independent lab requirements and
 
05:36:26.510 --> 05:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
everything can can I can we do that by
 
05:36:26.520 --> 05:36:27.650 align:start position:0%
everything can can I can we do that by
rule

05:36:27.650 --> 05:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
rule
 
05:36:27.660 --> 05:36:29.150 align:start position:0%
rule
please

05:36:29.150 --> 05:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:36:32.208 --> 05:36:32.218 align:start position:0%
have the department do it by rule
 
05:36:33.770 --> 05:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at you because you didn't
 
05:36:35.110 --> 05:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
like rules
 
05:36:37.310 --> 05:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
he already told me he didn't like rules
 
05:36:39.170 --> 05:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
before but is that all right yes I'm
 
05:36:40.670 --> 05:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
looking at you and I just you know I
 
05:36:42.410 --> 05:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
said okay that the Liquor Commission
 
05:36:44.390 --> 05:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
will generate the rules
 
05:36:51.948 --> 05:36:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:53.570 --> 05:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
well I would just assume to have it done
 
05:36:55.850 --> 05:36:55.860 align:start position:0%
by rules okay
 
05:36:57.770 --> 05:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
um because I'm not sure I'm not sure in
 
05:36:59.810 --> 05:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
rules they're going to be worrying about
 
05:37:01.970 --> 05:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
uh controlling interests in three and
 
05:37:03.590 --> 05:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
three is of us or any single cat you
 
05:37:07.250 --> 05:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
know in terms of the word independent
 
05:37:08.868 --> 05:37:08.878 align:start position:0%
means really independent you really
 
05:37:10.610 --> 05:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
you've never owned anything you never
 
05:37:12.110 --> 05:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
got involved you know that's what
 
05:37:14.990 --> 05:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
independent means to me but obviously
 
05:37:16.910 --> 05:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
that can be addressed in the rules
 
05:37:16.920 --> 05:37:19.010 align:start position:0%
that can be addressed in the rules
hearing

05:37:19.010 --> 05:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:37:21.708 --> 05:37:21.718 align:start position:0%
um so I want that to be done by Rules by
 
05:37:23.510 --> 05:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
05:37:23.520 --> 05:37:25.310 align:start position:0%
the commission
um

05:37:25.310 --> 05:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:28.788 --> 05:37:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:30.368 --> 05:37:30.378 align:start position:0%
what's retained
 
05:37:33.948 --> 05:37:33.958 align:start position:0%
why are we going to retain this
 
05:37:37.550 --> 05:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
right I'm just saying that when if and
 
05:37:40.368 --> 05:37:40.378 align:start position:0%
when no not our rules
 
05:37:44.150 --> 05:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
the rules hearing through the it would
 
05:37:46.850 --> 05:37:46.860 align:start position:0%
be the new title which um you know the
 
05:37:49.070 --> 05:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
liquor cannabis Commission
 
05:37:52.550 --> 05:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
we then look at uh generating the rules
 
05:37:56.330 --> 05:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
for what is an independent lab
 
05:37:59.150 --> 05:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
okay rather than putting it in statute
 
05:37:59.160 --> 05:38:00.708 align:start position:0%
okay rather than putting it in statute
so

05:38:00.708 --> 05:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:38:03.948 --> 05:38:03.958 align:start position:0%
um the next thing that I noticed that I
 
05:38:06.470 --> 05:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
want to revisit is the
 
05:38:06.480 --> 05:38:07.970 align:start position:0%
want to revisit is the
um

05:38:07.970 --> 05:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:10.490 --> 05:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
tax situation
 
05:38:14.090 --> 05:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
and right now it has reference to the
 
05:38:15.830 --> 05:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax
 
05:38:18.110 --> 05:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't I don't I don't a I don't
 
05:38:20.150 --> 05:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
like the idea we reference rooms in real
 
05:38:21.288 --> 05:38:21.298 align:start position:0%
estate because rooms and bills tax
 
05:38:23.690 --> 05:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
changes so the last thing I want to do
 
05:38:26.690 --> 05:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
is be changing taxes around
 
05:38:31.070 --> 05:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
um and so what I was going to suggest
 
05:38:32.810 --> 05:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
and this is you know obviously up for
 
05:38:35.628 --> 05:38:35.638 align:start position:0%
discussion for everybody is
 
05:38:37.368 --> 05:38:37.378 align:start position:0%
um right now our rooms and taxes eight
 
05:38:38.570 --> 05:38:38.580 align:start position:0%
and a half percent
 
05:38:41.868 --> 05:38:41.878 align:start position:0%
but uh what I have in front of me now is
 
05:38:45.050 --> 05:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
what other states have done in terms of
 
05:38:45.060 --> 05:38:46.430 align:start position:0%
what other states have done in terms of
Taxation

05:38:46.430 --> 05:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
Taxation
 
05:38:49.730 --> 05:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
uh if in a in a perfect world if we were
 
05:38:51.590 --> 05:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
to again try to compare it to industries
 
05:38:53.510 --> 05:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
that we do now
 
05:38:57.110 --> 05:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
um in in terms of the beer tax the 30
 
05:39:00.170 --> 05:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
cents a gallon is is collected long
 
05:39:03.708 --> 05:39:03.718 align:start position:0%
before uh you know it's before you buy
 
05:39:07.128 --> 05:39:07.138 align:start position:0%
your beer that tax has already been paid
 
05:39:10.250 --> 05:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
um and then it's done at the easiest way
 
05:39:13.190 --> 05:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
to do this is to have enforcement you
 
05:39:15.590 --> 05:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
know the commission's enforcement to be
 
05:39:17.628 --> 05:39:17.638 align:start position:0%
able to track what they see and what
 
05:39:18.890 --> 05:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
scene they see going out the door what
 
05:39:21.530 --> 05:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
they can track so you want to track do
 
05:39:24.708 --> 05:39:24.718 align:start position:0%
uh do some taxation at that level so our
 
05:39:27.110 --> 05:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
30 cents a gallon is done at that level
 
05:39:29.510 --> 05:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
the uh for instance that five percent
 
05:39:31.788 --> 05:39:31.798 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about the wine that
 
05:39:34.550 --> 05:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
is done again at the winery they're
 
05:39:37.250 --> 05:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
they're they're going to uh be paying
 
05:39:40.070 --> 05:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
that tax to the commission so what I was
 
05:39:42.890 --> 05:39:42.900 align:start position:0%
thinking is I I uh the state that is
 
05:39:47.390 --> 05:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
most our sister states that is the issue
 
05:39:49.250 --> 05:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
of whether we when we set up a tax rate
 
05:39:52.090 --> 05:39:52.100 align:start position:0%
that we want to be somewhat close
 
05:39:55.930 --> 05:39:55.940 align:start position:0%
Vermont is 14 percent
 
05:40:01.850 --> 05:40:01.860 align:start position:0%
uh in Massachusetts is uh 10.75 which I
 
05:40:03.288 --> 05:40:03.298 align:start position:0%
was a little struck by because I thought
 
05:40:05.330 --> 05:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
there was another local tax on top of it
 
05:40:09.708 --> 05:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
but I don't know and
 
05:40:09.718 --> 05:40:11.390 align:start position:0%
but I don't know and
Maine

05:40:11.390 --> 05:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
05:40:13.788 --> 05:40:13.798 align:start position:0%
which is our closest neighbor
 
05:40:17.090 --> 05:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
has not only they they have a 10 percent
 
05:40:19.610 --> 05:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
tax at the retail price
 
05:40:22.330 --> 05:40:22.340 align:start position:0%
but then they have
 
05:40:26.510 --> 05:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
335 dollars a pound for the flower
 
05:40:28.670 --> 05:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
buds I guess
 
05:40:31.788 --> 05:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
49 a pound for the trim
 
05:40:33.890 --> 05:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
and the only thing I can imagine is the
 
05:40:35.270 --> 05:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
trim is that means they took the stems
 
05:40:37.070 --> 05:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
and seeds out of the flower
 
05:40:38.570 --> 05:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
does anybody know
 
05:40:38.580 --> 05:40:43.430 align:start position:0%
does anybody know
right

05:40:43.430 --> 05:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:45.170 --> 05:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
this is something I'm recommending to
 
05:40:46.730 --> 05:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
change in the amendment the amendment
 
05:40:50.270 --> 05:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:52.610 --> 05:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
no I'm asking you guys what you think
 
05:40:55.070 --> 05:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you what do you think if we
 
05:41:02.090 --> 05:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:04.190 --> 05:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
okay what would you like to hear about
 
05:41:07.550 --> 05:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
the changes uh who would like to
 
05:41:09.650 --> 05:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
describe all the changes
 
05:41:09.660 --> 05:41:17.170 align:start position:0%
describe all the changes
okay

05:41:17.170 --> 05:41:17.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:19.310 --> 05:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
I already said we're gonna have to go
 
05:41:20.890 --> 05:41:20.900 align:start position:0%
through it
 
05:41:23.510 --> 05:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman committee good to
 
05:41:25.670 --> 05:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
see you again
 
05:41:28.128 --> 05:41:28.138 align:start position:0%
for the record Matt Simon I work for
 
05:41:31.250 --> 05:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
Prime ATC and I want to clarify that I
 
05:41:33.170 --> 05:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
am not authorized to speak on behalf of
 
05:41:35.090 --> 05:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
all members of the Coalition but I will
 
05:41:38.150 --> 05:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
do my best to describe the amendment and
 
05:41:40.550 --> 05:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
the positions that we have discussed and
 
05:41:42.830 --> 05:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
the reasons for them to such an extent
 
05:41:44.868 --> 05:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
that I understand them myself
 
05:41:47.030 --> 05:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
so just a very brief overview of the
 
05:41:49.010 --> 05:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
amendment I don't want to go through it
 
05:41:52.070 --> 05:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
with a fine-tooth comb but the first
 
05:41:55.010 --> 05:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
section at the top just adds changes the
 
05:41:56.690 --> 05:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
the definition of the Liquor Commission
 
05:41:58.128 --> 05:41:58.138 align:start position:0%
to change the name
 
05:41:59.750 --> 05:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
to the liquor and cannabis commission
 
05:42:01.970 --> 05:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
that was borrowed from the amendment
 
05:42:04.430 --> 05:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
that was offered in this committee
 
05:42:06.590 --> 05:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
the second chunk of text is the
 
05:42:08.530 --> 05:42:08.540 align:start position:0%
independent lab requirement
 
05:42:11.330 --> 05:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
this was text that was included in the
 
05:42:14.030 --> 05:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
coalition's original draft it was not
 
05:42:17.150 --> 05:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
included in the introduced version of HB
 
05:42:17.160 --> 05:42:18.670 align:start position:0%
included in the introduced version of HB
639

05:42:18.670 --> 05:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
639
 
05:42:21.170 --> 05:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
as a coalition many of us thought these
 
05:42:23.868 --> 05:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
were important Provisions to consider if
 
05:42:26.390 --> 05:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
the committee chooses to reject them we
 
05:42:28.788 --> 05:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
understand that we would push for these
 
05:42:30.410 --> 05:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
things in rule making in all likelihood
 
05:42:32.510 --> 05:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
or at least I would
 
05:42:34.070 --> 05:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
um but just to describe the section as
 
05:42:37.850 --> 05:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
you see it uh it it requires in statute
 
05:42:41.270 --> 05:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
that no Testing Lab have a Financial or
 
05:42:43.430 --> 05:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
that yeah no cannabis testing facility
 
05:42:45.470 --> 05:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
or individual with a controlling
 
05:42:47.868 --> 05:42:47.878 align:start position:0%
interest and a cannabis testing facility
 
05:42:50.030 --> 05:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
so I have a direct or indirect financial
 
05:42:52.670 --> 05:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
interest and an ATC a retail store or
 
05:42:55.970 --> 05:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
any other cannabis facility and we just
 
05:42:57.530 --> 05:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
think that's that's basic sense if
 
05:42:59.270 --> 05:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
people are going to have confidence in
 
05:43:00.708 --> 05:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
the testing system it does need to be
 
05:43:02.330 --> 05:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
independent there are too many
 
05:43:04.910 --> 05:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
incentives for a company to try to sell
 
05:43:07.010 --> 05:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
tainted product if they have a massive
 
05:43:08.868 --> 05:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
batch of flour that gets contaminated
 
05:43:11.628 --> 05:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
with mold that's a lot of value that
 
05:43:13.550 --> 05:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
they have to destroy and if nobody
 
05:43:17.270 --> 05:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
polices that then it could happen
 
05:43:19.730 --> 05:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
the rest of the section we chose to
 
05:43:21.470 --> 05:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
leave that in for this draft for your
 
05:43:23.230 --> 05:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
consideration these were the
 
05:43:25.730 --> 05:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
anti-oligopoly provisions that were in
 
05:43:26.868 --> 05:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
the original
 
05:43:29.110 --> 05:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment again mimicking other states
 
05:43:31.610 --> 05:43:31.620 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts allows
 
05:43:34.368 --> 05:43:34.378 align:start position:0%
no more than three establishments of any
 
05:43:36.530 --> 05:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
single category
 
05:43:38.510 --> 05:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
still on the first page it's still in
 
05:43:40.030 --> 05:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
the independent lab requirement
 
05:43:42.590 --> 05:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
Financial interests prohibited is the
 
05:43:44.208 --> 05:43:44.218 align:start position:0%
name of the section
 
05:43:46.850 --> 05:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
so Roman numeral One deals with the
 
05:43:49.368 --> 05:43:49.378 align:start position:0%
testing facilities requiring them to be
 
05:43:49.378 --> 05:43:50.448 align:start position:0%
testing facilities requiring them to be
independent

05:43:50.448 --> 05:43:50.458 align:start position:0%
independent
 
05:43:53.390 --> 05:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh the rest of that section is designed
 
05:43:55.310 --> 05:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
to prohibit excessive Market
 
05:43:58.010 --> 05:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
concentration understanding that the
 
05:44:00.948 --> 05:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
market is of a relatively known size
 
05:44:03.350 --> 05:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh back to the question of do we want
 
05:44:05.690 --> 05:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
five companies to make all the money or
 
05:44:07.430 --> 05:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
do we want the economic
 
05:44:09.410 --> 05:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
opportunities to be more broadly
 
05:44:12.048 --> 05:44:12.058 align:start position:0%
distributed this would require at least
 
05:44:13.788 --> 05:44:13.798 align:start position:0%
the beginning there would be a broad
 
05:44:16.628 --> 05:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
distribution of economic opportunities
 
05:44:19.670 --> 05:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
and then there could be consolidation of
 
05:44:23.390 --> 05:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
the market after that uh so that an a
 
05:44:25.070 --> 05:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
person or entity could have up to 20
 
05:44:26.990 --> 05:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
percent of of
 
05:44:29.930 --> 05:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
of operational facilities so this is
 
05:44:32.690 --> 05:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
based on Provisions that have been found
 
05:44:34.548 --> 05:44:34.558 align:start position:0%
to be intelligent in other states for
 
05:44:36.590 --> 05:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
the purpose of keeping Out quote unquote
 
05:44:38.810 --> 05:44:38.820 align:start position:0%
big marijuana unethical large
 
05:44:41.990 --> 05:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
corporations that might try to wreak
 
05:44:44.208 --> 05:44:44.218 align:start position:0%
havoc in New Hampshire cannabis and not
 
05:44:46.368 --> 05:44:46.378 align:start position:0%
be committed to the the values that the
 
05:44:49.190 --> 05:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
general court may want actors in that
 
05:44:50.990 --> 05:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
market to be contributed so I'd
 
05:44:53.090 --> 05:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
encourage you to just review that uh we
 
05:44:54.948 --> 05:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
wanted it to be considered and that's
 
05:44:56.090 --> 05:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
all we're asking is that it be
 
05:44:56.100 --> 05:44:58.970 align:start position:0%
all we're asking is that it be
considered

05:44:58.970 --> 05:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:01.490 --> 05:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
those are the only additions the rest of
 
05:45:04.548 --> 05:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
it is a language that's been removed or
 
05:45:07.310 --> 05:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
slightly tweaked from the introduced
 
05:45:11.030 --> 05:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
version of House Bill 639 so that Bill's
 
05:45:12.708 --> 05:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
already had a public hearing I don't
 
05:45:15.190 --> 05:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
feel that I need to read all of this
 
05:45:17.930 --> 05:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission or I'm sorry cannabis
 
05:45:20.390 --> 05:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
commission has been deleted the
 
05:45:21.530 --> 05:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
establishment of the Cannabis
 
05:45:23.090 --> 05:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
commission's been deleted it's replaced
 
05:45:23.100 --> 05:45:23.930 align:start position:0%
commission's been deleted it's replaced
with

05:45:23.930 --> 05:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:45:26.750 --> 05:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
the liquor and cannabis Commission
 
05:45:26.760 --> 05:45:29.510 align:start position:0%
the liquor and cannabis Commission
and

05:45:29.510 --> 05:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:45:33.170 --> 05:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
it simply provides much more statutory
 
05:45:36.230 --> 05:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
guidance and independent oversight in
 
05:45:37.850 --> 05:45:37.860 align:start position:0%
the form of the independent Advisory
 
05:45:37.860 --> 05:45:38.750 align:start position:0%
the form of the independent Advisory
Board

05:45:38.750 --> 05:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
Board
 
05:45:40.970 --> 05:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
as we discussed previously
 
05:45:43.850 --> 05:45:43.860 align:start position:0%
the home cultivation provisions and all
 
05:45:46.970 --> 05:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
references to them have been removed the
 
05:45:49.670 --> 05:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
annulment and re-sentencing Provisions
 
05:45:52.510 --> 05:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
have been removed
 
05:45:55.070 --> 05:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
which page are you at now I'm not
 
05:45:56.810 --> 05:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
anywhere I went back to generally
 
05:45:59.868 --> 05:45:59.878 align:start position:0%
describing what what you see and now we
 
05:46:01.310 --> 05:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
can scroll through
 
05:46:03.890 --> 05:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
if you like beginning on
 
05:46:06.048 --> 05:46:06.058 align:start position:0%
you know where it says red language to
 
05:46:07.128 --> 05:46:07.138 align:start position:0%
be removed that's where the bill
 
05:46:10.010 --> 05:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
actually starts right
 
05:46:13.128 --> 05:46:13.138 align:start position:0%
so this this first section uh deals with
 
05:46:15.230 --> 05:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
the fund administered by the Department
 
05:46:16.930 --> 05:46:16.940 align:start position:0%
of Health Human Services
 
05:46:20.448 --> 05:46:20.458 align:start position:0%
this is a piece that uh I believe DHHS
 
05:46:22.490 --> 05:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
and new Futures feels very important
 
05:46:24.350 --> 05:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
that there be a fund
 
05:46:26.990 --> 05:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
and that there be allocations for a
 
05:46:30.530 --> 05:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
number of reasons Roman numeral five uh
 
05:46:32.750 --> 05:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
allocations used for the following
 
05:46:34.788 --> 05:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
evidence-based voluntary programs for
 
05:46:36.410 --> 05:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
substance abuse related education
 
05:46:38.510 --> 05:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
prevention treatment recovery
 
05:46:41.090 --> 05:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment funding and
 
05:46:42.590 --> 05:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
training to Foster an informed
 
05:46:43.970 --> 05:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
adequately paid Behavioral Health
 
05:46:46.310 --> 05:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
Workforce and scientifically and
 
05:46:47.930 --> 05:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
medically accurate public education
 
05:46:47.940 --> 05:46:50.030 align:start position:0%
medically accurate public education
campaigns

05:46:50.030 --> 05:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
campaigns
 
05:46:53.570 --> 05:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
and it also requires a report on on that
 
05:47:04.250 --> 05:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:04.260 --> 05:47:07.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:47:07.070 --> 05:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:10.490 --> 05:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:13.548 --> 05:47:13.558 align:start position:0%
yeah the drug for funds one
 
05:47:15.650 --> 05:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
recommendation and this goes back to the
 
05:47:17.270 --> 05:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
study commission that New Hampshire had
 
05:47:19.310 --> 05:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
a few years ago one one thing that every
 
05:47:21.770 --> 05:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
state recommended was that you begin by
 
05:47:24.288 --> 05:47:24.298 align:start position:0%
collecting good Baseline data because if
 
05:47:26.390 --> 05:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
you don't have good Baseline data it's
 
05:47:28.548 --> 05:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
really hard to tell cause and effect
 
05:47:31.430 --> 05:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
after legalization so you're still
 
05:47:34.368 --> 05:47:34.378 align:start position:0%
hearing statistics from Colorado that
 
05:47:36.770 --> 05:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
are very confusing and they are very
 
05:47:38.990 --> 05:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
confusing because in many cases there
 
05:47:41.628 --> 05:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
was not Baseline data available prior to
 
05:47:44.750 --> 05:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
the Advent of legalization so you see a
 
05:47:47.270 --> 05:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
statistic jump way up and you think oh
 
05:47:49.010 --> 05:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
this must be the result of legalization
 
05:47:51.110 --> 05:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
really it's because they started
 
05:47:52.548 --> 05:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
collecting data that they were not
 
05:47:55.970 --> 05:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
collecting before so if you send more
 
05:47:57.530 --> 05:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
fishermen out into the sea you catch
 
05:47:59.150 --> 05:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
more fish that doesn't mean there are
 
05:48:01.670 --> 05:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
more fish and that creates a pretty
 
05:48:03.708 --> 05:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
distorted picture so this was just a
 
05:48:05.390 --> 05:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the study commission
 
05:48:07.850 --> 05:48:07.860 align:start position:0%
and and of pretty much everybody they
 
05:48:09.350 --> 05:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
heard from that you want to have this
 
05:48:11.570 --> 05:48:11.580 align:start position:0%
Baseline data and start collecting it as
 
05:48:15.350 --> 05:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:17.448 --> 05:48:17.458 align:start position:0%
next we get into the regulation of
 
05:48:21.288 --> 05:48:21.298 align:start position:0%
cannabis chapter 318f the definitions
 
05:48:22.910 --> 05:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to read all the
 
05:48:22.920 --> 05:48:25.788 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to read all the
definitions

05:48:25.788 --> 05:48:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:28.448 --> 05:48:28.458 align:start position:0%
now we're on page
 
05:48:32.150 --> 05:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
bottom of page two
 
05:48:37.128 --> 05:48:37.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:39.230 --> 05:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
if anybody has any questions I'm I'm
 
05:48:40.910 --> 05:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
happy to try to answer them the only one
 
05:48:43.490 --> 05:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
that's really new is the the Dual use
 
05:48:43.500 --> 05:48:46.490 align:start position:0%
that's really new is the the Dual use
certificate

05:48:46.490 --> 05:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:49.970 --> 05:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
which is part of the transfer of the
 
05:48:52.368 --> 05:48:52.378 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program it would
 
05:48:55.430 --> 05:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
allow atcs to serve the adult use Market
 
05:48:57.670 --> 05:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
if they qualify for a dual use
 
05:48:59.990 --> 05:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
certificate and there are rules and
 
05:49:07.310 --> 05:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:09.288 --> 05:49:09.298 align:start position:0%
so possession limit deleted all the
 
05:49:15.170 --> 05:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:16.670 --> 05:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
and I'll note that the possession limit
 
05:49:19.010 --> 05:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
was was simply modeled from last year's
 
05:49:21.850 --> 05:49:21.860 align:start position:0%
HB 1598
 
05:49:25.788 --> 05:49:25.798 align:start position:0%
the four ounces 10 grams
 
05:49:25.798 --> 05:49:39.650 align:start position:0%
the four ounces 10 grams
Etc

05:49:39.650 --> 05:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:45.590 --> 05:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:47.570 --> 05:49:47.580 align:start position:0%
yes I've made it through
 
05:49:50.090 --> 05:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of page four no questions
 
05:49:52.670 --> 05:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
so far so
 
05:49:54.230 --> 05:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
there's the restrictions on personal
 
05:49:57.530 --> 05:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
cultivation that all comes out
 
05:50:04.010 --> 05:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:07.190 --> 05:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
F4 no person shall smoke cannabis in a
 
05:50:17.810 --> 05:50:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:21.110 --> 05:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
that five uh
 
05:50:22.970 --> 05:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
provides a penalty for consuming
 
05:50:25.190 --> 05:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis while operating a moving
 
05:50:27.890 --> 05:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
vehicle and I would clarify that that is
 
05:50:30.230 --> 05:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
not a penalty for impaired driving it is
 
05:50:33.288 --> 05:50:33.298 align:start position:0%
already a crime to drive while impaired
 
05:50:36.948 --> 05:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
by cannabis or any other substance this
 
05:50:36.958 --> 05:50:37.730 align:start position:0%
by cannabis or any other substance this
is

05:50:37.730 --> 05:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:50:40.788 --> 05:50:40.798 align:start position:0%
a lower threshold of easy to prove
 
05:50:42.410 --> 05:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
somebody was consuming while they were
 
05:50:45.470 --> 05:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
driving creating a risk so this is a
 
05:50:48.470 --> 05:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
lesser crime that is easier to prove
 
05:50:55.190 --> 05:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:57.288 --> 05:50:57.298 align:start position:0%
because they can smell it or what's the
 
05:51:00.530 --> 05:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:03.170 --> 05:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
um it determining impairment
 
05:51:05.208 --> 05:51:05.218 align:start position:0%
is a challenge right
 
05:51:05.218 --> 05:51:06.110 align:start position:0%
is a challenge right
um

05:51:06.110 --> 05:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:08.750 --> 05:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
we have drug recognition experts who are
 
05:51:10.250 --> 05:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
trained to be able to evaluate
 
05:51:13.548 --> 05:51:13.558 align:start position:0%
impairment and if somebody's suspect of
 
05:51:15.530 --> 05:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
impaired driving there's a process and
 
05:51:17.030 --> 05:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
and they go through that they could have
 
05:51:18.830 --> 05:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
a blood test
 
05:51:20.150 --> 05:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
um but if somebody's smoking a joint
 
05:51:21.770 --> 05:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
walk driving down the road and the cop
 
05:51:23.628 --> 05:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
sees them this would
 
05:51:25.548 --> 05:51:25.558 align:start position:0%
that would in and of itself be be an
 
05:51:29.990 --> 05:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:30.000 --> 05:51:32.090 align:start position:0%
 
F6

05:51:32.090 --> 05:51:32.100 align:start position:0%
F6
 
05:51:36.110 --> 05:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis accessories authorize this
 
05:51:38.270 --> 05:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
would allow for
 
05:51:40.368 --> 05:51:40.378 align:start position:0%
sale of
 
05:51:43.548 --> 05:51:43.558 align:start position:0%
accessories paraphernalia to individuals
 
05:51:46.010 --> 05:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
21 and older
 
05:51:48.590 --> 05:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
and it would give the liquor and
 
05:51:52.070 --> 05:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis commission authority to
 
05:51:55.250 --> 05:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
enact reasonable regulations for
 
05:52:01.788 --> 05:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:05.270 --> 05:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
the sale of accessories today that's
 
05:52:05.280 --> 05:52:06.590 align:start position:0%
the sale of accessories today that's
legal

05:52:06.590 --> 05:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
legal
 
05:52:09.830 --> 05:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
well I guess it depends on what it is
 
05:52:11.930 --> 05:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
I agree with that I think it depends on
 
05:52:13.310 --> 05:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
what it is there are a number of stores
 
05:52:16.490 --> 05:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
that sell a wide range of accessories
 
05:52:19.430 --> 05:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
um some accessories could potentially be
 
05:52:21.470 --> 05:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
used in extractions and could be
 
05:52:23.868 --> 05:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
dangerous so I I think having some rules
 
05:52:25.788 --> 05:52:25.798 align:start position:0%
and at least the authority to make those
 
05:52:27.948 --> 05:52:27.958 align:start position:0%
rules make sense I'm not immediately
 
05:52:29.150 --> 05:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
aware of any
 
05:52:32.150 --> 05:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
dangerous accessories but
 
05:52:34.310 --> 05:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
some people do use accessories that are
 
05:52:35.690 --> 05:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
probably dangerous they could contain
 
05:52:39.350 --> 05:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
metal or other other lead I'm sorry it
 
05:52:42.288 --> 05:52:42.298 align:start position:0%
contain cheap metal that contains leader
 
05:52:45.048 --> 05:52:45.058 align:start position:0%
or whatever so like in the interest of
 
05:52:47.030 --> 05:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
consumer protection and health this is a
 
05:52:49.128 --> 05:52:49.138 align:start position:0%
probably a good authority to have don't
 
05:52:52.548 --> 05:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:54.470 --> 05:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
yeah it actually is an issue people buy
 
05:52:57.948 --> 05:52:57.958 align:start position:0%
cheap Vape cartridges uh in bulk from
 
05:52:59.390 --> 05:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
China and they're made with a very cheap
 
05:53:01.548 --> 05:53:01.558 align:start position:0%
I remember that with the toys they were
 
05:53:04.128 --> 05:53:04.138 align:start position:0%
talking about the toys that from China
 
05:53:06.170 --> 05:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
that some toys were made with lit or
 
05:53:07.850 --> 05:53:07.860 align:start position:0%
yeah so even if you get yourself
 
05:53:10.128 --> 05:53:10.138 align:start position:0%
something what's wrong with it even if
 
05:53:12.410 --> 05:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
you have your cannabis oil 100 tested
 
05:53:14.628 --> 05:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
completely free of contaminants it can
 
05:53:17.030 --> 05:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
take on contaminants by leaching them
 
05:53:18.230 --> 05:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
05:53:20.330 --> 05:53:20.340 align:start position:0%
the bad Hardware
 
05:53:20.340 --> 05:53:22.788 align:start position:0%
the bad Hardware
okay

05:53:22.788 --> 05:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:53:26.150 --> 05:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
F7 deals with odor and personal
 
05:53:29.448 --> 05:53:29.458 align:start position:0%
possession and suggests that they are
 
05:53:29.458 --> 05:53:30.350 align:start position:0%
possession and suggests that they are
not

05:53:30.350 --> 05:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:53:32.390 --> 05:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
grounds for a search
 
05:53:34.730 --> 05:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
and this is something there's case law
 
05:53:37.548 --> 05:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
on this and other states have done this
 
05:53:39.650 --> 05:53:39.660 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert on it I was hoping
 
05:53:40.850 --> 05:53:40.860 align:start position:0%
Paul Toomey would be here in case
 
05:53:44.448 --> 05:53:44.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:47.628 --> 05:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
but it also clarifies that that section
 
05:53:49.190 --> 05:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
does not prevent them in any way from
 
05:53:52.970 --> 05:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
conducting impairment tests or uh trying
 
05:53:56.990 --> 05:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:58.850 --> 05:53:58.860 align:start position:0%
now if it was the Cannabis commission
 
05:54:01.390 --> 05:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely gone
 
05:54:04.070 --> 05:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
some of this language might want to be
 
05:54:07.850 --> 05:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
re-included in some way but it it uh
 
05:54:10.010 --> 05:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
it just all goes away in this draft you
 
05:54:12.830 --> 05:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
have a question Jason well uh instead of
 
05:54:14.930 --> 05:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
stepping through all 40 pages of this
 
05:54:16.788 --> 05:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
thing can we just stipulate that any
 
05:54:19.310 --> 05:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
further uh changes being offered right
 
05:54:21.650 --> 05:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
now or simply to remove references to
 
05:54:24.010 --> 05:54:24.020 align:start position:0%
homegirl and annulment
 
05:54:26.570 --> 05:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
evidently Jay would want to go through
 
05:54:33.180 --> 05:54:33.190 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:33.190 --> 05:54:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

05:54:35.990 --> 05:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:54:36.000 --> 05:54:38.530 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
thing

05:54:38.530 --> 05:54:38.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:41.208 --> 05:54:41.218 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to resort to skimming if
 
05:54:44.150 --> 05:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's more helpful well I'm using this
 
05:54:48.190 --> 05:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:51.170 --> 05:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
so so obviously there's nothing really
 
05:54:55.250 --> 05:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
changed too much in the remaining
 
05:54:57.368 --> 05:54:57.378 align:start position:0%
but yes
 
05:54:59.750 --> 05:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
so you would we want to go through the
 
05:55:02.030 --> 05:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
stuff that's that's being deleted I
 
05:55:02.040 --> 05:55:03.230 align:start position:0%
stuff that's that's being deleted I
guess

05:55:03.230 --> 05:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
guess
 
05:55:03.240 --> 05:55:04.910 align:start position:0%
guess
so

05:55:04.910 --> 05:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:55:13.010 --> 05:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:15.650 --> 05:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman may I ask a question yes
 
05:55:17.990 --> 05:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you
 
05:55:18.000 --> 05:55:18.708 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you
um

05:55:18.708 --> 05:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:20.390 --> 05:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
this may have been answered previously
 
05:55:23.090 --> 05:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
even if it has been I apologize
 
05:55:25.970 --> 05:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
um but I wanted to ask why the annulment
 
05:55:29.090 --> 05:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
of arrests and convictions is removed
 
05:55:31.070 --> 05:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
I believe that was a policy decision
 
05:55:32.690 --> 05:55:32.700 align:start position:0%
yeah made it the last meeting by the
 
05:55:32.700 --> 05:55:34.610 align:start position:0%
yeah made it the last meeting by the
committee

05:55:34.610 --> 05:55:34.620 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:55:41.030 --> 05:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:43.368 --> 05:55:43.378 align:start position:0%
issue so that is in their committee
 
05:55:46.490 --> 05:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you so I'm sorry to correct you Mr
 
05:55:48.288 --> 05:55:48.298 align:start position:0%
chairman there is another bill in
 
05:55:49.368 --> 05:55:49.378 align:start position:0%
another committee that deals with
 
05:55:51.948 --> 05:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
homegrow there is not another bill that
 
05:55:53.930 --> 05:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
deals with annulment and resentencing
 
05:55:56.628 --> 05:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
that's right you can't do the annulment
 
05:56:00.650 --> 05:56:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:03.170 --> 05:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
no Rich you gotta you gotta pass you
 
05:56:06.170 --> 05:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
gotta legalize the marijuana then you
 
05:56:11.948 --> 05:56:11.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:14.208 --> 05:56:14.218 align:start position:0%
I'll just say from the coalition's
 
05:56:16.368 --> 05:56:16.378 align:start position:0%
perspective that we dearly wish it could
 
05:56:18.170 --> 05:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
be included but if there are political
 
05:56:20.570 --> 05:56:20.580 align:start position:0%
reasons that make it that this bill
 
05:56:22.788 --> 05:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
won't pass if that's in there we're
 
05:56:24.410 --> 05:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
willing to work with the general court
 
05:56:26.930 --> 05:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
and try to make it happen next session
 
05:56:28.310 --> 05:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
yeah you just we don't have any
 
05:56:30.368 --> 05:56:30.378 align:start position:0%
expertise to to
 
05:56:36.708 --> 05:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:38.990 --> 05:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
no F9 is just the Advisory Board and we
 
05:56:41.030 --> 05:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
made it apply to the
 
05:56:44.390 --> 05:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission instead of the the
 
05:56:47.510 --> 05:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
Cannabis commission so it's 13 members
 
05:56:50.208 --> 05:56:50.218 align:start position:0%
one expert in cannabis cultivation one
 
05:56:52.190 --> 05:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
expert in cannabis retailing one expert
 
05:56:54.530 --> 05:56:54.540 align:start position:0%
in product manufacturing one in testing
 
05:56:58.548 --> 05:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
one ATC rep one patient one
 
05:57:00.770 --> 05:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
representative of consumers two Public
 
05:57:02.750 --> 05:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
Health experts one law enforcement
 
05:57:02.760 --> 05:57:03.830 align:start position:0%
Health experts one law enforcement
expert

05:57:03.830 --> 05:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
expert
 
05:57:05.810 --> 05:57:05.820 align:start position:0%
one expert in social welfare criminal
 
05:57:08.690 --> 05:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
justice one in financing
 
05:57:10.910 --> 05:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
and you know obviously this could be
 
05:57:13.010 --> 05:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
rearranged in any number of ways and
 
05:57:15.170 --> 05:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
there may be suggestions on that but the
 
05:57:17.090 --> 05:57:17.100 align:start position:0%
idea of independent oversights something
 
05:57:22.070 --> 05:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:25.190 --> 05:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
just as a matter of palatability could
 
05:57:26.150 --> 05:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
we leave the name of the Liquor
 
05:57:28.730 --> 05:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
Commission just as the Liquor Commission
 
05:57:30.650 --> 05:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
it already oversees tobacco but we don't
 
05:57:32.150 --> 05:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
we typically refer to as a Liquor
 
05:57:33.350 --> 05:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
Commission rather than liquor and
 
05:57:35.448 --> 05:57:35.458 align:start position:0%
tobacco I think it just might be a
 
05:57:37.788 --> 05:57:37.798 align:start position:0%
better sell to the public particularly
 
05:57:42.288 --> 05:57:42.298 align:start position:0%
those who are perhaps uh uh more uh
 
05:57:44.570 --> 05:57:44.580 align:start position:0%
difficult to bring on board to this
 
05:57:46.250 --> 05:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
leaving it just as the Liquor Commission
 
05:57:48.110 --> 05:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
and perhaps in time it could become the
 
05:57:50.390 --> 05:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
liquor and cannabis commission could be
 
05:57:55.090 --> 05:57:55.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:58.690 --> 05:57:58.700 align:start position:0%
we could call it the sin commission
 
05:58:00.830 --> 05:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
you know what absolutely we're going to
 
05:58:02.330 --> 05:58:02.340 align:start position:0%
call the center commission just pull in
 
05:58:02.340 --> 05:58:03.670 align:start position:0%
call the center commission just pull in
everything

05:58:03.670 --> 05:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
everything
 
05:58:05.510 --> 05:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative but did you mean still
 
05:58:08.390 --> 05:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
two Commissioners leave it exactly the
 
05:58:09.770 --> 05:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
same we're just going to Grant at
 
05:58:10.970 --> 05:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
differently just called The Liquor
 
05:58:13.610 --> 05:58:13.620 align:start position:0%
Commission yeah I I do I think you're
 
05:58:16.610 --> 05:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
right I think you're right
 
05:58:18.530 --> 05:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
I'm much more interested in policy than
 
05:58:22.128 --> 05:58:22.138 align:start position:0%
what we call things so okay so to the
 
05:58:23.448 --> 05:58:23.458 align:start position:0%
next where I see things are being
 
05:58:25.910 --> 05:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
deleted I'm now looking at
 
05:58:27.410 --> 05:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
like because I'm probably the only one
 
05:58:29.030 --> 05:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's numbered as Pages now but I'm not
 
05:58:32.448 --> 05:58:32.458 align:start position:0%
looking at page 17 which is actually 318
 
05:58:32.458 --> 05:58:35.170 align:start position:0%
looking at page 17 which is actually 318
F20

05:58:35.170 --> 05:58:35.180 align:start position:0%
F20
 
05:58:38.810 --> 05:58:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:42.048 --> 05:58:42.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:42.058 --> 05:58:44.330 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:58:44.330 --> 05:58:44.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:58:49.610 --> 05:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:51.590 --> 05:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
yeah there was some references to the
 
05:58:54.590 --> 05:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
annulment language in the section on
 
05:58:56.390 --> 05:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
data collection and those have been for
 
05:58:57.948 --> 05:58:57.958 align:start position:0%
data collection marked to be removed
 
05:58:57.958 --> 05:59:00.470 align:start position:0%
data collection marked to be removed
right

05:59:00.470 --> 05:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:02.448 --> 05:59:02.458 align:start position:0%
similarly the cost of Administration
 
05:59:05.270 --> 05:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
direct costs incurred by the annulment
 
05:59:08.570 --> 05:59:08.580 align:start position:0%
processes that language is removed yeah
 
05:59:08.580 --> 05:59:10.250 align:start position:0%
processes that language is removed yeah
okay

05:59:10.250 --> 05:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:59:12.830 --> 05:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
and then we ran along
 
05:59:15.110 --> 05:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
so 19
 
05:59:17.208 --> 05:59:17.218 align:start position:0%
it was all the current law that was that
 
05:59:19.548 --> 05:59:19.558 align:start position:0%
was already it's in the bill that's
 
05:59:21.650 --> 05:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
being deleted okay
 
05:59:24.360 --> 05:59:24.370 align:start position:0%
so then I have page 20
 
05:59:24.370 --> 05:59:25.010 align:start position:0%
so then I have page 20
[Music]

05:59:25.010 --> 05:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:59:25.020 --> 05:59:26.470 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

05:59:26.470 --> 05:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:29.628 --> 05:59:29.638 align:start position:0%
uh section 15 of the bill against more
 
05:59:32.750 --> 05:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
annulment language we removed from the
 
05:59:32.760 --> 05:59:34.128 align:start position:0%
annulment language we removed from the
bill

05:59:34.128 --> 05:59:34.138 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:59:37.430 --> 05:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman I want to talk about uh
 
05:59:37.440 --> 05:59:38.570 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman I want to talk about uh
briefly

05:59:38.570 --> 05:59:38.580 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
05:59:42.048 --> 05:59:42.058 align:start position:0%
it's on page 23.
 
05:59:44.570 --> 05:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
uh the section says certain crimes not
 
05:59:47.810 --> 05:59:47.820 align:start position:0%
to be pursued dismissal okay so this is
 
05:59:51.230 --> 05:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
a policy choice for the committee it was
 
05:59:53.030 --> 05:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
part of the annulment
 
05:59:56.990 --> 05:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh section but it only deals with cases
 
05:59:59.990 --> 06:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
that are pending after this law passes
 
06:00:02.690 --> 06:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
but before the effective date so if
 
06:00:06.708 --> 06:00:06.718 align:start position:0%
somebody has a charge for possession
 
06:00:09.110 --> 06:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
that will be becoming legal and they get
 
06:00:12.110 --> 06:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
it after this this law passes it directs
 
06:00:14.750 --> 06:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
the the prosecutors to dismiss and not
 
06:00:17.628 --> 06:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
pursue criminal charges and that's just
 
06:00:20.448 --> 06:00:20.458 align:start position:0%
to prevent anybody from
 
06:00:22.730 --> 06:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
you know experiencing an injustice
 
06:00:25.850 --> 06:00:25.860 align:start position:0%
between the legislature approving this
 
06:00:28.970 --> 06:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
and it taking effect so if you think
 
06:00:30.948 --> 06:00:30.958 align:start position:0%
it's important to remove that section I
 
06:00:32.708 --> 06:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
don't think we will object too strongly
 
06:00:34.850 --> 06:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
prosecutors are capable of dismissing
 
06:00:36.948 --> 06:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
cases without being directed to by the
 
06:00:38.570 --> 06:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
legislature that was generally the
 
06:00:40.128 --> 06:00:40.138 align:start position:0%
practice in Vermont without them being
 
06:00:41.750 --> 06:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
required to
 
06:00:44.090 --> 06:00:44.100 align:start position:0%
but a statute would require them to and
 
06:00:46.150 --> 06:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
we would prefer that
 
06:00:51.110 --> 06:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
so how far does this go uh just uh a few
 
06:00:53.030 --> 06:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
paragraphs there one two and three it's
 
06:00:55.610 --> 06:00:55.620 align:start position:0%
all section 50 it's all section 15 of
 
06:00:57.288 --> 06:00:57.298 align:start position:0%
the bill okay
 
06:01:01.970 --> 06:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
right and then 16 we get into taxes okay
 
06:01:01.980 --> 06:01:07.610 align:start position:0%
right and then 16 we get into taxes okay
right

06:01:07.610 --> 06:01:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:09.830 --> 06:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
06:01:09.840 --> 06:01:11.570 align:start position:0%
that's fine
okay

06:01:11.570 --> 06:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:01:14.208 --> 06:01:14.218 align:start position:0%
that may be everything and if you have
 
06:01:16.190 --> 06:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
any questions I'd be okay well then I
 
06:01:21.410 --> 06:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:26.750 --> 06:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:26.760 --> 06:01:29.868 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:01:29.868 --> 06:01:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:32.510 --> 06:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
this is where the taxation is the
 
06:01:36.288 --> 06:01:36.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:39.230 --> 06:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
it goes from and also section
 
06:01:43.788 --> 06:01:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:46.128 --> 06:01:46.138 align:start position:0%
because you're you're going to pay your
 
06:01:51.530 --> 06:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:53.270 --> 06:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
and that and this makes it brings your
 
06:01:58.010 --> 06:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
your atcs into for-profit is that is in
 
06:02:01.250 --> 06:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
in this section am I reading this right
 
06:02:01.260 --> 06:02:10.868 align:start position:0%
in this section am I reading this right
foreign

06:02:10.868 --> 06:02:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:12.890 --> 06:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry what page are you on Mr
 
06:02:14.810 --> 06:02:14.820 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm 23. okay
 
06:02:17.390 --> 06:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm actually that
 
06:02:19.970 --> 06:02:19.980 align:start position:0%
section numbers but that's
 
06:02:22.970 --> 06:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
normally how we the legislature know
 
06:02:25.490 --> 06:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
what paragraphs we're talking about so
 
06:02:26.868 --> 06:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
06:02:29.690 --> 06:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
um you renumber them you know 16 to 17s
 
06:02:33.048 --> 06:02:33.058 align:start position:0%
for the tax 17 18 hours the tax rooms
 
06:02:34.788 --> 06:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
and meals so I was just looking at 16 17
 
06:02:37.128 --> 06:02:37.138 align:start position:0%
which was the business profits tax
 
06:02:40.250 --> 06:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
06:02:40.260 --> 06:02:41.090 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

06:02:41.090 --> 06:02:41.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:44.030 --> 06:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
yeah we we want I personally think and
 
06:02:46.610 --> 06:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
we can discuss this that we should
 
06:02:48.650 --> 06:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
remove decouple this from the rooms and
 
06:02:51.230 --> 06:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
meals tax that it should be its own
 
06:02:54.650 --> 06:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
separate tax and that I recommend five
 
06:02:54.660 --> 06:02:57.530 align:start position:0%
separate tax and that I recommend five
percent

06:02:57.530 --> 06:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:00.410 --> 06:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
it's half a mean
 
06:03:03.288 --> 06:03:03.298 align:start position:0%
and five percent if five percent is a
 
06:03:05.830 --> 06:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
pretty nominal tax
 
06:03:08.330 --> 06:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
uh five percent is what we charge for
 
06:03:08.340 --> 06:03:10.128 align:start position:0%
uh five percent is what we charge for
wine

06:03:10.128 --> 06:03:10.138 align:start position:0%
wine
 
06:03:12.110 --> 06:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
so we have a history of the five percent
 
06:03:12.120 --> 06:03:14.890 align:start position:0%
so we have a history of the five percent
tax

06:03:14.890 --> 06:03:14.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:19.548 --> 06:03:19.558 align:start position:0%
uh five percent is uh I don't know five
 
06:03:22.128 --> 06:03:22.138 align:start position:0%
percent but yeah right now my mind is
 
06:03:24.048 --> 06:03:24.058 align:start position:0%
five percent so
 
06:03:24.058 --> 06:03:25.070 align:start position:0%
five percent so
um

06:03:25.070 --> 06:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:27.410 --> 06:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
but I yeah that I would it's enough of a
 
06:03:29.510 --> 06:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
discount that someone's gonna feel that
 
06:03:32.390 --> 06:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
five percent when it comes to purchasing
 
06:03:35.628 --> 06:03:35.638 align:start position:0%
and the whole idea is for us to uh
 
06:03:39.650 --> 06:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
uh be attractive to out of state
 
06:03:41.510 --> 06:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about five percent on a
 
06:03:43.548 --> 06:03:43.558 align:start position:0%
couple hundred dollar purchase too not
 
06:03:45.110 --> 06:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
just it's not like a pack of cigarettes
 
06:03:47.690 --> 06:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
right right yeah so five percent could
 
06:03:49.610 --> 06:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
be significant the saving the difference
 
06:03:50.930 --> 06:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
between Maine and New Hampshire could be
 
06:03:53.890 --> 06:03:53.900 align:start position:0%
significant to drive cross-border sales
 
06:03:56.990 --> 06:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah Jason
 
06:03:59.030 --> 06:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
I do believe you're also talking about
 
06:04:01.190 --> 06:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh some cultivation taxes yeah so then
 
06:04:03.708 --> 06:04:03.718 align:start position:0%
and then along with that so the added
 
06:04:06.708 --> 06:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
not just the five percent so then
 
06:04:08.990 --> 06:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
um when originally when I was
 
06:04:11.330 --> 06:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
um working with the
 
06:04:15.170 --> 06:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
the chairman we were discussing that the
 
06:04:17.750 --> 06:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the perfect world where you would
 
06:04:20.570 --> 06:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
want to do attacks is at the closest to
 
06:04:22.970 --> 06:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
the production level so you know for
 
06:04:24.770 --> 06:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
instance our 30 cents a gallon is
 
06:04:27.708 --> 06:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
charged to uh the the beer you know
 
06:04:27.718 --> 06:04:29.390 align:start position:0%
charged to uh the the beer you know
manufacturers

06:04:29.390 --> 06:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
06:04:33.470 --> 06:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
um so that in Maine also not only has
 
06:04:35.628 --> 06:04:35.638 align:start position:0%
that five percent their 10 excise tax
 
06:04:38.030 --> 06:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's when they have the flower the
 
06:04:41.570 --> 06:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
trim the immature plant or seedling
 
06:04:46.128 --> 06:04:46.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:46.138 --> 06:04:48.410 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:04:48.410 --> 06:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:04:48.420 --> 06:04:50.448 align:start position:0%
so
so

06:04:50.448 --> 06:04:50.458 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:04:50.458 --> 06:04:51.590 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:04:51.590 --> 06:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:53.810 --> 06:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
does anybody know about Maine's taxes or
 
06:04:56.570 --> 06:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
know what they mean but the question I
 
06:04:58.270 --> 06:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
had is like this has one and a half per
 
06:05:01.610 --> 06:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
immature plant or scene link so is that
 
06:05:01.620 --> 06:05:02.868 align:start position:0%
immature plant or scene link so is that
a

06:05:02.868 --> 06:05:02.878 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:05:05.990 --> 06:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh if somebody do they sell plants or
 
06:05:08.810 --> 06:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
seedlings or do they sell the seed or
 
06:05:11.208 --> 06:05:11.218 align:start position:0%
they sell
 
06:05:12.948 --> 06:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
um or is this
 
06:05:15.708 --> 06:05:15.718 align:start position:0%
like uh is this April 1st like April 1st
 
06:05:18.048 --> 06:05:18.058 align:start position:0%
would you have to do an inventory tax
 
06:05:20.330 --> 06:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about April 1st I I can
 
06:05:22.670 --> 06:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
provide some information so first of all
 
06:05:22.680 --> 06:05:24.170 align:start position:0%
provide some information so first of all
yes

06:05:24.170 --> 06:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:05:26.770 --> 06:05:26.780 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned 10 in Massachusetts
 
06:05:29.628 --> 06:05:29.638 align:start position:0%
that sales are also subjected to their
 
06:05:29.638 --> 06:05:30.910 align:start position:0%
that sales are also subjected to their
6.7

06:05:30.910 --> 06:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
6.7
 
06:05:35.330 --> 06:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
6.75 sales tax so it's really a 16 tax
 
06:05:37.128 --> 06:05:37.138 align:start position:0%
and then there's a two percent local
 
06:05:38.990 --> 06:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
option tax so it ends up being about a
 
06:05:41.750 --> 06:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
20 that's effective tax rate number yeah
 
06:05:43.788 --> 06:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
and that's incidentally the lowest in
 
06:05:46.310 --> 06:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
the country uh Massachusetts and Vermont
 
06:05:49.610 --> 06:05:49.620 align:start position:0%
uh Maine has the 10 tax plus they have
 
06:05:52.128 --> 06:05:52.138 align:start position:0%
the added cultivation tax that brings it
 
06:05:54.110 --> 06:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
up to a round and effective tax rate of
 
06:05:56.090 --> 06:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
18 to 20 percent is my understanding I'm
 
06:05:58.310 --> 06:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
not a tax policy expert and I'm
 
06:06:00.590 --> 06:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
generally pretty agnostic on the tax
 
06:06:03.530 --> 06:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
questions I would caution on one front
 
06:06:05.868 --> 06:06:05.878 align:start position:0%
with a cultivation tax as we discussed
 
06:06:07.970 --> 06:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
yesterday there is a possibility that
 
06:06:10.610 --> 06:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce will become legal as
 
06:06:12.948 --> 06:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
I mentioned possibly by a Court ruling
 
06:06:16.490 --> 06:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh indicating that forbidding Interstate
 
06:06:19.730 --> 06:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
Commerce in Canada is unconstitutional a
 
06:06:21.410 --> 06:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
violation of the dormant Commerce Clause
 
06:06:23.750 --> 06:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
so if that were to happen we would have
 
06:06:25.610 --> 06:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
to yeah we wouldn't be getting much from
 
06:06:27.230 --> 06:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
a cultivation tax in all likelihood
 
06:06:29.690 --> 06:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
retail stores would be selling cannabis
 
06:06:31.490 --> 06:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
grown in places like California where
 
06:06:33.048 --> 06:06:33.058 align:start position:0%
it's cheaper to grow so you wouldn't get
 
06:06:35.330 --> 06:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
any tax no we understand that it may be
 
06:06:38.750 --> 06:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
reduced quite substantially right
 
06:06:41.150 --> 06:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
but and just so you know it's
 
06:06:46.070 --> 06:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
interesting that the um the beer tax
 
06:06:48.708 --> 06:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
this is Mark are you still here
 
06:06:51.770 --> 06:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
yeah so that 30 cents a gallon because
 
06:06:54.890 --> 06:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
it's collected by the beer distributors
 
06:06:56.990 --> 06:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
isn't that tax still applied to beer
 
06:07:00.850 --> 06:07:00.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:03.410 --> 06:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
that 30 cents a gallon how so we do
 
06:07:06.070 --> 06:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
because we tax it at the distributed
 
06:07:08.628 --> 06:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
distributor level
 
06:07:11.090 --> 06:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
that's why we're able to
 
06:07:11.100 --> 06:07:15.288 align:start position:0%
that's why we're able to
get

06:07:15.288 --> 06:07:15.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:15.298 --> 06:07:16.490 align:start position:0%
 
right

06:07:16.490 --> 06:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:07:18.530 --> 06:07:18.540 align:start position:0%
so with
 
06:07:20.750 --> 06:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
um let me put let me put my thinking cap
 
06:07:22.490 --> 06:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
on that one because in terms of how we
 
06:07:25.070 --> 06:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
would structure so that that if there
 
06:07:26.868 --> 06:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
was a change in
 
06:07:29.570 --> 06:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
Jacksonville because theoretically if if
 
06:07:32.750 --> 06:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
it was coming from out of state it's got
 
06:07:34.250 --> 06:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
to be trucked in
 
06:07:38.330 --> 06:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
it's got to be so what we do now uh in
 
06:07:40.970 --> 06:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that we still require
 
06:07:43.010 --> 06:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
an out-of-state
 
06:07:46.128 --> 06:07:46.138 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer
 
06:07:49.610 --> 06:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
to register with us
 
06:07:52.910 --> 06:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
and and then we tax
 
06:07:55.010 --> 06:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
um tax their their beer at 30 cents a
 
06:07:55.020 --> 06:07:55.850 align:start position:0%
um tax their their beer at 30 cents a
gallon

06:07:55.850 --> 06:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
gallon
 
06:07:57.650 --> 06:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
is that if I you think that's right Mark
 
06:08:00.590 --> 06:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:04.368 --> 06:08:04.378 align:start position:0%
all right you didn't bring Matt here
 
06:08:06.048 --> 06:08:06.058 align:start position:0%
he would know that right on the top of
 
06:08:07.250 --> 06:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
his head
 
06:08:10.310 --> 06:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I think I got it right yeah
 
06:08:12.708 --> 06:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just I'm just trying to
 
06:08:14.150 --> 06:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
understand your thinking you said in a
 
06:08:16.310 --> 06:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
perfect world it would be
 
06:08:18.110 --> 06:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
I guess like the beer attacks done at
 
06:08:20.690 --> 06:08:20.700 align:start position:0%
the the cultivation of it like what's
 
06:08:22.128 --> 06:08:22.138 align:start position:0%
your thinking on in a perfect world that
 
06:08:23.810 --> 06:08:23.820 align:start position:0%
versus just at the top so we don't have
 
06:08:25.850 --> 06:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
to worry about any of the stuff below uh
 
06:08:27.350 --> 06:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
the reason why the cultivation level is
 
06:08:31.730 --> 06:08:31.740 align:start position:0%
easy is because net means that uh right
 
06:08:34.010 --> 06:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
at this moment where the stuff is
 
06:08:36.170 --> 06:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
created the marijuana is created the
 
06:08:38.590 --> 06:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
problem is once it leads the cultivator
 
06:08:41.868 --> 06:08:41.878 align:start position:0%
then now it's going out the door so how
 
06:08:43.850 --> 06:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
do we make sure that everything that
 
06:08:46.910 --> 06:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
goes out the door is is taxed you don't
 
06:08:48.708 --> 06:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
want if you wait till another time you
 
06:08:50.090 --> 06:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
don't know where the marijuana came from
 
06:08:53.090 --> 06:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
a did it from other sources and then
 
06:08:55.670 --> 06:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
didn't get its original tax but it's it
 
06:08:58.910 --> 06:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
is more difficult for the commission to
 
06:09:02.090 --> 06:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
track and audit in other words the best
 
06:09:04.368 --> 06:09:04.378 align:start position:0%
way to audit is to audit there on the
 
06:09:06.410 --> 06:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
facility seeing what's going out the
 
06:09:09.410 --> 06:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
door so historically that's that's you
 
06:09:11.990 --> 06:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
know that that we that we that's what
 
06:09:14.090 --> 06:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
we'd like our Auditors to be doing is
 
06:09:16.190 --> 06:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
that when they go into
 
06:09:18.470 --> 06:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturers now they have
 
06:09:20.810 --> 06:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
expanded Duty because they have to also
 
06:09:23.510 --> 06:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know make making sure that the beer
 
06:09:26.150 --> 06:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
that is not delivered out because
 
06:09:28.010 --> 06:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
originally the beer tax was collected by
 
06:09:30.230 --> 06:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
or is collected by beer distributors so
 
06:09:32.030 --> 06:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
if the tax if the beer is not going out
 
06:09:34.190 --> 06:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
the door you know it's being consumed
 
06:09:34.200 --> 06:09:35.270 align:start position:0%
the door you know it's being consumed
there

06:09:35.270 --> 06:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:09:36.770 --> 06:09:36.780 align:start position:0%
the Auditors are going to make sure that
 
06:09:38.868 --> 06:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
that all that beer that's being consumed
 
06:09:42.048 --> 06:09:42.058 align:start position:0%
they're on premise is also paying the 30
 
06:09:44.990 --> 06:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
cents a gallon I see okay
 
06:09:47.810 --> 06:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
so he so the realest would be if someday
 
06:09:49.250 --> 06:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
if we're importing
 
06:09:50.930 --> 06:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
importing it for somewhere else we need
 
06:09:52.670 --> 06:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
a system there which is right you guys
 
06:09:55.190 --> 06:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
so if we compared it to our current beer
 
06:09:58.010 --> 06:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
model which was we would require any
 
06:10:00.470 --> 06:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
outside producer who was shipping into
 
06:10:03.350 --> 06:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
the state that they would have to get an
 
06:10:06.730 --> 06:10:06.740 align:start position:0%
um uh out of state license
 
06:10:08.510 --> 06:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
and then
 
06:10:10.430 --> 06:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
um we that and then all that out of
 
06:10:12.410 --> 06:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
state license is okay I'm bringing it in
 
06:10:15.530 --> 06:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
it's coming in and then uh once it comes
 
06:10:17.750 --> 06:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the state then we would get our
 
06:10:21.110 --> 06:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
theoretically our tax and so it's it's
 
06:10:24.410 --> 06:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
easier to do it that way versus just at
 
06:10:27.170 --> 06:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
the marijuana shop you think
 
06:10:30.590 --> 06:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
um well in terms of ensuring that you're
 
06:10:33.230 --> 06:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
not there's not anything funny funny
 
06:10:36.890 --> 06:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
going on between when where it comes in
 
06:10:39.368 --> 06:10:39.378 align:start position:0%
to say and we're going into the store
 
06:10:41.330 --> 06:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
you want to make sure the truck is
 
06:10:42.470 --> 06:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
really going where it's supposed to be
 
06:10:45.410 --> 06:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
going I see okay that and that was the
 
06:10:48.110 --> 06:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
model of the three-tier system what was
 
06:10:50.628 --> 06:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
that kind of Regulation gotcha did I see
 
06:10:52.490 --> 06:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
another hand up over here yep you know
 
06:10:54.230 --> 06:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
I'd be inclined to actually have a to do
 
06:10:56.330 --> 06:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
all of the taxation at the district at
 
06:10:57.890 --> 06:10:57.900 align:start position:0%
the uh cultivation level to continue
 
06:10:59.690 --> 06:10:59.700 align:start position:0%
with a tax-free New Hampshire type of
 
06:10:59.700 --> 06:11:00.708 align:start position:0%
with a tax-free New Hampshire type of
model

06:11:00.708 --> 06:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
model
 
06:11:02.448 --> 06:11:02.458 align:start position:0%
it's all a sleight of hand because of
 
06:11:03.590 --> 06:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
course the consumer is going to pay for
 
06:11:05.750 --> 06:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
it in the end anyhow that's true um and
 
06:11:07.368 --> 06:11:07.378 align:start position:0%
we could then have the marketing
 
06:11:08.930 --> 06:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
Advantage what is the tax on marijuana
 
06:11:10.610 --> 06:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and Sierra well of
 
06:11:12.048 --> 06:11:12.058 align:start position:0%
course it's not zero you're still paying
 
06:11:14.208 --> 06:11:14.218 align:start position:0%
for it uh the difficulty would be the
 
06:11:15.590 --> 06:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce issue but we could
 
06:11:17.690 --> 06:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
also put a sunset provision in there if
 
06:11:20.868 --> 06:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
x happens then then why which is easy
 
06:11:22.128 --> 06:11:22.138 align:start position:0%
enough to write if we were to just give
 
06:11:24.470 --> 06:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
it to doj to write a sunset provision
 
06:11:26.690 --> 06:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
yeah the other problem
 
06:11:30.048 --> 06:11:30.058 align:start position:0%
um I I was thinking the economics of it
 
06:11:33.048 --> 06:11:33.058 align:start position:0%
that is that now the guy has spent all
 
06:11:35.390 --> 06:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
this money he's got he's growing he's
 
06:11:37.850 --> 06:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
now growing it and he's delivering it so
 
06:11:40.190 --> 06:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
it's selling it and then he's going to
 
06:11:43.970 --> 06:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
be collecting the has to pay the tax at
 
06:11:46.250 --> 06:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
the time so what's interesting about
 
06:11:48.170 --> 06:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
when you think about when the
 
06:11:50.690 --> 06:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
legislative and the wisdom of having the
 
06:11:53.810 --> 06:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
beer distributor collect attacks is that
 
06:11:55.850 --> 06:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
now the beer has left the manufacturer
 
06:11:58.490 --> 06:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
he's gone to the distributor the
 
06:12:01.610 --> 06:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
distributor is delivering it to the on
 
06:12:03.470 --> 06:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
or off-premise licensee
 
06:12:05.930 --> 06:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
at that point and this is unbelievable
 
06:12:08.868 --> 06:12:08.878 align:start position:0%
but we have a law that says that those
 
06:12:11.690 --> 06:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
on-premise off-premise licensees must
 
06:12:16.310 --> 06:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
pay their bill in 15 days well why
 
06:12:19.250 --> 06:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
because in that bill is the 30 cents a
 
06:12:21.590 --> 06:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
gallon tax so then it goes to the
 
06:12:23.570 --> 06:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
distributor and then the distributor
 
06:12:25.910 --> 06:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
then sends it to the Liquor Commission
 
06:12:27.288 --> 06:12:27.298 align:start position:0%
right which was a problem that I thought
 
06:12:29.270 --> 06:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
of we could create a type of credit or
 
06:12:30.708 --> 06:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
something to that extent for the yeah
 
06:12:32.628 --> 06:12:32.638 align:start position:0%
it's for the cultivator but it's it's
 
06:12:34.070 --> 06:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
not an easy problem to tackle but
 
06:12:35.628 --> 06:12:35.638 align:start position:0%
there's a marketing Advantage if we're
 
06:12:37.310 --> 06:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
trying to compete against others I agree
 
06:12:40.010 --> 06:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
with you but I um
 
06:12:42.650 --> 06:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
uh I I was just a little worried that if
 
06:12:45.590 --> 06:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
we made the cultivation tax too high it
 
06:12:47.708 --> 06:12:47.718 align:start position:0%
then becomes a burden on the cultivators
 
06:12:50.150 --> 06:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
and it was all this more cat and that
 
06:12:52.910 --> 06:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
and then again makes a burden on how we
 
06:12:54.890 --> 06:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
have small cultivators it's now you got
 
06:12:56.868 --> 06:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
to be a pretty wealthy cultivator
 
06:12:59.330 --> 06:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
because you've got to upfront that cash
 
06:13:02.810 --> 06:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
so I I was thinking that that yes it is
 
06:13:04.730 --> 06:13:04.740 align:start position:0%
a possibility that that cultivation tax
 
06:13:06.650 --> 06:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
could disappear altogether
 
06:13:08.570 --> 06:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
or that we'll end up doing like we do
 
06:13:11.030 --> 06:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
with beer which is that if you're
 
06:13:13.548 --> 06:13:13.558 align:start position:0%
importing your marijuana into the state
 
06:13:15.830 --> 06:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire you'll get get a
 
06:13:15.840 --> 06:13:16.670 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire you'll get get a
license

06:13:16.670 --> 06:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
license
 
06:13:18.708 --> 06:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
the other public out of state beverage
 
06:13:18.718 --> 06:13:20.150 align:start position:0%
the other public out of state beverage
license

06:13:20.150 --> 06:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
license
 
06:13:21.890 --> 06:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
how do you do that with that Mark is
 
06:13:29.750 --> 06:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:29.760 --> 06:13:30.890 align:start position:0%
 
right

06:13:30.890 --> 06:13:30.900 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:13:30.900 --> 06:13:32.930 align:start position:0%
right
right

06:13:32.930 --> 06:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:13:36.048 --> 06:13:36.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:39.288 --> 06:13:39.298 align:start position:0%
so we could we can consider now just so
 
06:13:41.090 --> 06:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
you know this is where back when I
 
06:13:44.750 --> 06:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to do this all by rule later but
 
06:13:46.910 --> 06:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
I certainly understand that if somebody
 
06:13:48.470 --> 06:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
if if we're going to get this
 
06:13:50.750 --> 06:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
legislation off the ground people are
 
06:13:52.070 --> 06:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to want to know what the tax
 
06:13:53.990 --> 06:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
consequences are up front you know
 
06:13:55.970 --> 06:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
before they make an investment they want
 
06:13:58.128 --> 06:13:58.138 align:start position:0%
to know what the tax structure is so
 
06:14:00.890 --> 06:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
we're I'm not wedded to anything yet so
 
06:14:02.510 --> 06:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
let's just all think about this so that
 
06:14:04.788 --> 06:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
when we come come back on Tuesday people
 
06:14:07.670 --> 06:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
can you know see where you're at but so
 
06:14:10.250 --> 06:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
I was thinking so assuming that immature
 
06:14:11.690 --> 06:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
do we know what the immature plant
 
06:14:14.510 --> 06:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
ceiling or the proceed what what is what
 
06:14:16.670 --> 06:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
is you know anything about that tax
 
06:14:19.610 --> 06:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
the issue was I believe if you create a
 
06:14:21.708 --> 06:14:21.718 align:start position:0%
single tax rate for all cannabis and
 
06:14:24.650 --> 06:14:24.660 align:start position:0%
it's weight-based flour is worth much
 
06:14:27.288 --> 06:14:27.298 align:start position:0%
more trimmed high quality flour is much
 
06:14:29.510 --> 06:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
worth much more than trim you can make
 
06:14:31.070 --> 06:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
extractions from trim you can make
 
06:14:34.010 --> 06:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
edibles from trim and you know I'm not
 
06:14:35.750 --> 06:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
an expert on such things but this was a
 
06:14:37.368 --> 06:14:37.378 align:start position:0%
way to reflect that
 
06:14:40.310 --> 06:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
so that the immature plant is
 
06:14:44.150 --> 06:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
the is the male plants no an immature
 
06:14:46.128 --> 06:14:46.138 align:start position:0%
plant would be a Seedling defined as
 
06:14:48.230 --> 06:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
usually under a foot tall and some
 
06:14:50.510 --> 06:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
stores they would sell those yes home
 
06:14:52.250 --> 06:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
grows legal in Maine so that's that's
 
06:14:53.930 --> 06:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
the reason there's a robust because they
 
06:14:55.910 --> 06:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
have homegrown in Maine very much so
 
06:14:58.250 --> 06:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
okay so we don't even need to bother
 
06:15:00.770 --> 06:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
with those two then the proceed we don't
 
06:15:02.030 --> 06:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
need to bother with the procedure we
 
06:15:03.770 --> 06:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
probably don't we don't we don't need to
 
06:15:05.390 --> 06:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
do the proceed we don't do all we need
 
06:15:07.430 --> 06:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
is the flour and the trim
 
06:15:08.990 --> 06:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
I think that would make sense to have
 
06:15:11.390 --> 06:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
those two categories if proceeding with
 
06:15:13.070 --> 06:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
a cultivation tax
 
06:15:14.930 --> 06:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
let me just point out that where
 
06:15:17.390 --> 06:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
cultivation taxes have been enacted
 
06:15:19.610 --> 06:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
Alaska is another example the main
 
06:15:22.548 --> 06:15:22.558 align:start position:0%
argument for that has been wanting to
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
create a stable tax rate that would be
 
06:15:28.430 --> 06:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
produced stable revenues over time the
 
06:15:30.890 --> 06:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
knowledge that if you have a retail tax
 
06:15:33.830 --> 06:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
only it'll be percentage based and it'll
 
06:15:36.230 --> 06:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
be dollar based so when the price of
 
06:15:37.670 --> 06:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
retail cannabis
 
06:15:39.948 --> 06:15:39.958 align:start position:0%
uh Cuts in half
 
06:15:42.230 --> 06:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
your taxes will also cut in half it's a
 
06:15:43.788 --> 06:15:43.798 align:start position:0%
percentage of the revenue and there's an
 
06:15:44.930 --> 06:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
understanding that once the market
 
06:15:46.970 --> 06:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
becomes mature prices will drop
 
06:15:49.250 --> 06:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
considerably so by taxing from the
 
06:15:51.350 --> 06:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
cultivator by weight that theoretically
 
06:15:54.650 --> 06:15:54.660 align:start position:0%
gives you a more stable uh if it's
 
06:15:56.990 --> 06:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
whatever per pound cheap in Alaska it's
 
06:15:59.930 --> 06:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
only fifty dollars for the mature per
 
06:16:02.090 --> 06:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
ounce or per ounce yeah it's actually
 
06:16:03.830 --> 06:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
quite quite high and they're having a
 
06:16:05.650 --> 06:16:05.660 align:start position:0%
lot of issues
 
06:16:08.090 --> 06:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
it's not flexible has been the issue
 
06:16:10.430 --> 06:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
with it and when the market evolves
 
06:16:12.288 --> 06:16:12.298 align:start position:0%
rapidly and market conditions change
 
06:16:16.310 --> 06:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
rapidly and you have a tax that's uh
 
06:16:18.650 --> 06:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
by weight like that it has a dramatic
 
06:16:21.770 --> 06:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
dramatic impact I will say just from the
 
06:16:24.170 --> 06:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
perspective of the why why we chose the
 
06:16:26.750 --> 06:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax one reason was we've
 
06:16:28.190 --> 06:16:28.200 align:start position:0%
heard from a number of members that they
 
06:16:30.410 --> 06:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
don't want to vote for any new tax and
 
06:16:32.570 --> 06:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
that by putting it in an existing tax
 
06:16:34.910 --> 06:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
was not creating a new tax so that
 
06:16:37.490 --> 06:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
seemed to be uh helpful in at least
 
06:16:40.070 --> 06:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
picking up some support uh from some
 
06:16:40.080 --> 06:16:41.208 align:start position:0%
picking up some support uh from some
members

06:16:41.208 --> 06:16:41.218 align:start position:0%
members
 
06:16:45.770 --> 06:16:45.780 align:start position:0%
and while Revenue has never been my I've
 
06:16:47.750 --> 06:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
never sold cannabis legalization as a
 
06:16:49.670 --> 06:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
windfall for the state or it said the
 
06:16:51.530 --> 06:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
money's the reason we should do it I do
 
06:16:54.830 --> 06:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
talk to legislators in both Chambers and
 
06:16:56.930 --> 06:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
I know that some individuals do want the
 
06:16:58.730 --> 06:16:58.740 align:start position:0%
state to make Revenue substantial
 
06:17:01.430 --> 06:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue off of this so having a tax that
 
06:17:03.110 --> 06:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
does produce some revenue is probably
 
06:17:05.150 --> 06:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
important to getting some votes
 
06:17:05.160 --> 06:17:07.010 align:start position:0%
important to getting some votes
right

06:17:07.010 --> 06:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:17:07.020 --> 06:17:08.930 align:start position:0%
right
okay

06:17:08.930 --> 06:17:08.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:17:12.048 --> 06:17:12.058 align:start position:0%
but you guys did not have this at the
 
06:17:14.690 --> 06:17:14.700 align:start position:0%
cultivator level in the bill you just
 
06:17:16.070 --> 06:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
had the the
 
06:17:18.170 --> 06:17:18.180 align:start position:0%
eight and a half we chose not to create
 
06:17:21.288 --> 06:17:21.298 align:start position:0%
any new taxes Mr chairman okay yeah so
 
06:17:23.030 --> 06:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:17:23.040 --> 06:17:24.288 align:start position:0%
all right
okay

06:17:24.288 --> 06:17:24.298 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:17:26.270 --> 06:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
so anyway we can talk about that so but
 
06:17:28.850 --> 06:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
let's say at for the premise I'm I'm
 
06:17:32.448 --> 06:17:32.458 align:start position:0%
running on right now is uh the five
 
06:17:36.170 --> 06:17:36.180 align:start position:0%
percent at the retail level and then
 
06:17:36.180 --> 06:17:36.770 align:start position:0%
percent at the retail level and then
um

06:17:36.770 --> 06:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:40.010 --> 06:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
I guess Alaska looks cheap but then as
 
06:17:42.910 --> 06:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
compared to the 335 a pound but
 
06:17:47.090 --> 06:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
50 times 16.
 
06:17:49.250 --> 06:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
that's a lot that's a lot of money ain't
 
06:17:51.470 --> 06:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
it when the price for an ounce drops to
 
06:17:54.530 --> 06:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
50 an ounce and you have a 50 tax on it
 
06:17:56.390 --> 06:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
then it becomes pretty exorbitant at
 
06:17:59.030 --> 06:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
that point that's pretty steep okay so
 
06:18:00.650 --> 06:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
going back to cutting Main in half might
 
06:18:04.128 --> 06:18:04.138 align:start position:0%
be okay okay so main main is you know
 
06:18:07.610 --> 06:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
335 uh we'll call it 340 divided in half
 
06:18:07.620 --> 06:18:09.048 align:start position:0%
335 uh we'll call it 340 divided in half
so

06:18:09.048 --> 06:18:09.058 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:18:12.410 --> 06:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
um and then the trim is 94 so somewhere
 
06:18:15.548 --> 06:18:15.558 align:start position:0%
in there so 50 and
 
06:18:18.288 --> 06:18:18.298 align:start position:0%
175 something like that
 
06:18:22.190 --> 06:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
okay everybody yep okay
 
06:18:24.770 --> 06:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
um and anything else basically did we
 
06:18:26.390 --> 06:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
see that we see anything else I think
 
06:18:29.048 --> 06:18:29.058 align:start position:0%
that was yes
 
06:18:32.090 --> 06:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
06:18:32.100 --> 06:18:32.868 align:start position:0%
okay all right
okay

06:18:32.868 --> 06:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:18:34.430 --> 06:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
we're all anybody else have anything
 
06:18:37.610 --> 06:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:42.470 --> 06:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:44.030 --> 06:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
we're done
 
06:18:46.970 --> 06:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman our next meeting is Tuesday
 
06:18:50.270 --> 06:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
30 minutes after the session correct
