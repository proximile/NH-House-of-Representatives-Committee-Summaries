00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
recess till about
 
00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:58.840 --> 00:20:27.149 align:start position:0%

and join me for the pledge of allegiance
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
begin I pledge allegiance to the flag of
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
the United States of America and to the
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%

00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
okay we are picking up again on our
 
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
continued hearings on the retained bail
 
00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:39.519 align:start position:0%
bills and today we're going to be
 
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
addressing the subject of people who are
 
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
arrested while they are already on bail
 
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
for a previous
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
crime we have several proposals that
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
we've been working on that we're going
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
to discuss right now um the first
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
proposal with regard to someone who's
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
arrested wall on bail for a previous
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
charge what we've looked at um based on
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
all the uh testimony we've received
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
first of all that the public in general
 
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
is had enough of people being arrested
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
in this type of revolving door type of
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
situation um happening and it's not
 
00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily the the very serious crimes
 
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
as um were contemplated in sever of the
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
bills we had like a list of 12 or 13
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
crimes these are the more um for lack of
 
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
a better term nuisance crimes the
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
shoplifting the trespassing the
 
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
disorderly person
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
repeatedly so what we are contemplating
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
is if you are arrested while on bail for
 
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
the first time you are picked
 
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
up we are talking about having the court
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
system through the bail Commissioners
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
use give the person a choice here's your
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
choice you've been arrested and violated
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
the terms of your first B bail which is
 
00:31:59.549 --> 00:31:59.559 align:start position:0%
a new crime contempt of
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
court you may be
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
released if you so choose but as a
 
00:32:07.149 --> 00:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
condition of that release you will wear
 
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
an electronic
 
00:32:10.629 --> 00:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
monitor which will be placed on by the
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner
 
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
and he will or she will set the
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
conditions of that bail and what that
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring system will be
 
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
monitoring with regard to your specific
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
situation or B you can decline the
 
00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:29.559 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring and you will
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
remain in jail until you see a
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
judge second offense if you get picked
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
up yet again while wearing the monitor
 
00:32:38.629 --> 00:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
after you've been released again you
 
00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.519 align:start position:0%
will be held until you see the
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
judge now as part of that we are
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
cognizant of the Court's ability and the
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
defense Department's ability to be able
 
00:32:55.389 --> 00:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
to um conduct business on Saturdays at
 
00:32:56.669 --> 00:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
some point in the future that may be
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
something we we have to look at
 
00:33:01.629 --> 00:33:01.639 align:start position:0%
currently with the time frame money and
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
resources available to everybody
 
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
involved that's just not
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
feasible so as part of that and we'll be
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
discussing this next week more in depth
 
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
we're looking at implementing a
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
magistrate program where magistrates
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
will and I brought this up briefly
 
00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
yesterday be a sounded to each county in
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
the state and they'll have um first line
 
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.549 align:start position:0%
the state and they'll have um first line
supervis

00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559 align:start position:0%
supervis
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
supervisory um over the how many bail
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
condition uh bail Commissioners are in
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
their counties Etc they'll probably
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
coordinate um the issuance of these of
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
these um electronic monitoring devices
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
and the whole program will be left up to
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
the court um that's that's their
 
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
business we're not going to micromanage
 
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
it but as far as the weekends which is
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
what I'm want to address if you're
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
picked up on a
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
Friday um for one of these things you
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
and it's uh you will be
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
held up to 24 hours at which point you
 
00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
will see a magistrate over the weekend
 
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
on a Saturday who will make the
 
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
determination whether or not your
 
00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:09.879 align:start position:0%
dangerous Flight Risk or you should be
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
held um they are going to be no
 
00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:14.599 align:start position:0%
different than the judge I mean excuse
 
00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
me than the bail commissioner they're
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
not going to have any more Powers than
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner with regard to the
 
00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
bail um so it's not going to invoke all
 
00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
the necessary um hearings and everything
 
00:34:26.589 --> 00:34:26.599 align:start position:0%
of this nature it just means that you're
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
going to be held for this person who
 
00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
will be um probably a JD someone more
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
qualified than the um average bail
 
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner is again that'll be set in
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
the legislation that we discuss next
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
week so for today that is what we are
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
proposing um with regard to the arrest
 
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
and rearrest all on bail and I would
 
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:51.079 align:start position:0%
open it up to discussion from the
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
members representative Stone thank you
 
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh in regards to the term magistrate
 
00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
have you set a definition of a
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
magistrate is going to be someone who
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
has to be admitted to the New Hampshire
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
bar we have not yet set that definition
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
but that is one of the things that we
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
are working on as far as what the
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
qualifications would have to be thank
 
00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
you and as we I I would welcome your
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
input because we're at that stage where
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure out what that
 
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
is but with anything with regard to the
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
arrest and
 
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
Muse I think one of the dilemmas uh uh
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
facing us is um uh with issues like this
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
um there are so many factors that come
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
into play um
 
00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
essentially I think we're in a
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
situation where I think we can
 
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
substantially uh reduce the risk uh you
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
know of the public being harmed by a
 
00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:53.599 align:start position:0%
person who's uh out on bail uh who
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
should not be on the other hand I don't
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
think we're ever going to be be in a
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
situation where we can 100%
 
00:36:05.069 --> 00:36:05.079 align:start position:0%
guarantee uh you know uh uh that all of
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
us will be safe so I I think there are
 
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable measures and I think this is
 
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
one of them um electronic monitoring as
 
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
an option uh is something that will uh
 
00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
provide uh more guard rails um and it's
 
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
an alternative to incarceration it's
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
however not without its problems and uh
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
I think there are issues that we we're
 
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
going to have to work through in terms
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
of in terms of the cost uh who does the
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
monitoring um how exactly bail
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are you know you know
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
implement this and are trained to do to
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
do it um but the bottom line is what it
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
does is it it does put more
 
00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
accountability in the system it puts
 
00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:53.079 align:start position:0%
more oversight into the system uh it's
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
something that the public uh seems to be
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
asking for for and it is um one of the
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
it's a less restrictive option than than
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
simply holding people in jail pre-trial
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
detention uh and it puts people in a
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
situation where even if they've
 
00:37:15.309 --> 00:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
committed a second crime a lot of times
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
those second crimes are still relatively
 
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
minor uh and even though people have
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
been accused of crimes and sometimes
 
00:37:27.069 --> 00:37:27.079 align:start position:0%
even even accused of two crimes um we're
 
00:37:27.079 --> 00:37:28.990 align:start position:0%
even even accused of two crimes um we're
not

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:31.720 align:start position:0%
always there you know frequently there
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
are situations where people are actually
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
in the unconvicted of neither
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
crime so having uh an additional tool in
 
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
the toolbox uh you know to to better
 
00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that that people you know that
 
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
people do appear
 
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
um you know to me seems like something
 
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:55.240 align:start position:0%
that is uh is worth uh exploring more uh
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
and potentially trying
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and um to just to add on to
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
that point um it will be significant
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
there is going to be cost and there is
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
going to be a fiscal note but I dare say
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
it will be um it will be much less than
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
holding people would cost um if they're
 
00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
arrested on the first time after um
 
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
they've been bailed because that will
 
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
drive up exponentially the number of
 
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
people who are held and um the cost will
 
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
be very very high so I feel like this
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
will be a lower cost to the state and
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
the counties um actually it shouldn't be
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
any cost to the counties where the
 
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
counties would bear the full cost of
 
00:38:38.309 --> 00:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
people being held and we heard from the
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
counties that they just don't have the
 
00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
the the finances or the the wherewithal
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
to to be able to staff that type of a
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
increase so that's and also keeping in
 
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
mind this is a choice we're offering
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
people a choice they don't have to take
 
00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring if they feel it
 
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
violates their privacy or their rights
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
they're free to to sit and wait for the
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
judge to hear their their
 
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
case uh representative
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you is there going to be a
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
recovery cost uh for the individual if
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
convicted we we're not sure yet because
 
00:39:14.349 --> 00:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
we don't know the cost um what it's
 
00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
going to cost at this point um we could
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
leave it open to the court whether or
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
not they assign a fine or a uh some type
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
of recovery um for the cost of the
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
expense of the monitoring the difference
 
00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:28.839 align:start position:0%
the difference
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
is it's pre-conviction so I think it's
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
even if they do end up being ultimately
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
convicted I don't know that it'll be
 
00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
difficult to to um to recover that
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
amount I don't know we can discuss that
 
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
with the court and see if that's
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
something they're interested in in thank
 
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
you yeah definitely worth worth raising
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
um representative Murray um I was
 
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
thinking along the same vein like I know
 
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
um the folks who came to talk with us
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
from pre-ra services and stuff talked
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
about how they would um charge the
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
people that were being monitored for the
 
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
cost of monitoring them daily um but I
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's better to do it as a
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
recovery if they're you know convicted
 
00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
but those were
 
00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:14.839 align:start position:0%
pre-trial represent Stone now just to a
 
00:40:16.589 --> 00:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
followup to that the probation and
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
parole department already utilize
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring and I believe
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
there is a service fee for them being
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
out on release I guess that's an Avenue
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
that's already been set that's why I'm
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
looking at new process is served and the
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
conviction is had that maybe there is a
 
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
recovering mechanism that could help
 
00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
offset the cost of the taxpayers I agree
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
um I I I agree um within the the usual
 
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
parameters of indigency or whatever if
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
it the person is able to repay then they
 
00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:45.319 align:start position:0%
should and we'll leave it up to the
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
courts about how they would like to
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
reclaim that money I think
 
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.710 align:start position:0%
reclaim that money I think
representative

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
Muse and one of one of the things um
 
00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
that we've run into as we've done some
 
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
research on this is uh there are
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
alternatives to uh to things like
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
electronic ankle bracelets so there are
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
apps that some jurisdictions are using
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we've learned uh
 
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
during testimony in the various work
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
sessions that we have is that
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
surprisingly there are a lot of people
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh even even homeless folks um uh who
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
have who have uh cell phones um uh
 
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh these apps you know
 
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
will work on the particular phones that
 
00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:28.839 align:start position:0%
people have uh is is another question
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
but increasingly there are uh there
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
appear to be options um uh in addition
 
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
to just conventional ankle bracelets so
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
as we as we write the statute one of the
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
things that we uh we've talked about
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
doing is actually writing it in a way
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
that describes the
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
functionality of the monitoring device
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
without necessarily specifying which
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
monitoring device um is uh is
 
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
acceptable I think actually that's um
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's a very good point and we are
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
going to um as broadly defined
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring as possible so
 
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:09.640 align:start position:0%
that we don't have to come back and
 
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
broaden it later as technology gets um
 
00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
advances faster and
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
faster we want to um describe what we're
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish with the electronic
 
00:42:22.549 --> 00:42:22.559 align:start position:0%
monitoring and leave it to the court to
 
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
decide which method of Technology they
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
use going forward so that if such a time
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
comes when they are able to use a
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
different technology maybe software or
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
what have you um or combination of any
 
00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
of them they have the bandwidth or the
 
00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:38.839 align:start position:0%
the allowance in the legislation to do
 
00:42:41.069 --> 00:42:41.079 align:start position:0%
that so I think that's that's a very
 
00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
good point further discussion anyone
 
00:42:47.069 --> 00:42:47.079 align:start position:0%
else representative Harry
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
gther we also talked a little bit about
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
um on the first arrest if we realize
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
that that person is um let's say um
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
doing drugs or mentally ill um at that
 
00:43:04.549 --> 00:43:04.559 align:start position:0%
time trying to refer them to for some
 
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
type of help with whatever is determined
 
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
at that
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
time yes we did discuss that and we are
 
00:43:14.109 --> 00:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
going to put that in what what it what
 
00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:16.839 align:start position:0%
we're contemplating is so when a when
 
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
someone is first arrested regardless of
 
00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.030 align:start position:0%
someone is first arrested regardless of
the

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
crime there are Services generally
 
00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:25.640 align:start position:0%
available so for example if someone is
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
arrested for shoplifting because they
 
00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:30.559 align:start position:0%
say I I have to have food for my family
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
um you know the state is not without a
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
heart so what we are going to do is
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that that person gets referred to
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
Services where they could get food so
 
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
that if they're picked up again for
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
shoplifting for food after they've been
 
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
given a referral for services we know
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay you had a a chance to get that and
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
you were offered that so we're going to
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
mandate that Services be referred on
 
00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
first arrest for anything that is
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
related tangentially to the crime
 
00:43:58.589 --> 00:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
they're arrested for if they're arrested
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
for drugs referral to rehabilitation
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
services or what have you same thing
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
goes for food anything like that where
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
there are services available to make
 
00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
sure that the people are connected with
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
them as soon as
 
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
possible did that cover that Lindon
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
yes anyone else representative Reed you
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
seem to have some some uh reservations
 
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
so um if they're referred for services
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
um will they still be um you know have
 
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
to see the judge and and okay this is
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
this is just a um here you are you're
 
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
under arrest here's your bail and by the
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
way here all right so it's not in place
 
00:44:40.349 --> 00:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
of or L of or anything like that it's
 
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
just making sure that that people are
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
made aware of services that are
 
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
available all right thank you often
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
times I think what happens now some of
 
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:49.720 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners are very good at
 
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
saying okay look you know you could go
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
here but some of them may not some of
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
them may not know and so often times
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
people are arrested didn't let go and
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
they're just right back where they were
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
with no idea how to contact services so
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to um mandate that people
 
00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
are at least giv referrals to services
 
00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
that are available I thank
 
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
you I do have another question but I
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
think I need the officer to answer this
 
00:45:12.119 --> 00:45:13.190 align:start position:0%
think I need the officer to answer this
for

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%

you
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.230 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
good morning good
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
morning so gown so are you Hills be
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
you okay do you do you say as golf town
 
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
do you know the different services that
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
might be in the
 
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
area as a police officer yeah I I guess
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's kind of a broad qu okay say um
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
someone that has mental illness do you
 
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
know where you might be able to refer
 
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
that person or someone seems to be on
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
drugs or alcohol do you know where yeah
 
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
we have the mobile crisis team which is
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
out a greater uh greater manchest of
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
mental health um so we know we we we
 
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
have connections with them all right
 
00:46:15.309 --> 00:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
that was one of the questions that we
 
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
had because we realized that uh
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro doesn't have the pre-service
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
type um accountability as some of the
 
00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:26.079 align:start position:0%
other locations that came and spoke
 
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
before us the other counties came and
 
00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:30.839 align:start position:0%
like Rockingham has a pretty decent
 
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro does not exactly but for the
 
00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
most part the officers do know of the
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
different types of services
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
possibly yeah we we
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
we often deal with uh the mobile crisis
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
team with great Manchester mental health
 
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
for mental health um issues
 
00:46:52.549 --> 00:46:52.559 align:start position:0%
okay and I think we're we're not
 
00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
contemplating putting that on the police
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
anyway I think we're going to um we're
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
going to put that on the courts to make
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
sure that the people are notified at the
 
00:47:02.349 --> 00:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
services in the area um versus the
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
police I think we um we talked about on
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
first arrest yeah but they still have to
 
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
get bailed so a bail commissioner could
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
through the court provide uh whatever
 
00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:13.559 align:start position:0%
documentation the Court gives them to
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
hand out for that area because I don't
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
want to put that funding cost to produce
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
all that information on the police
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
departments um if we're going to pay the
 
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
courts anyway any other questions for
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
the officer representative Stone please
 
00:47:25.839 --> 00:47:26.589 align:start position:0%
the officer representative Stone please
thank

00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
you in your experience do you find that
 
00:47:32.109 --> 00:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
these proposals would meet the needs to
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
try to address the Nu and arrests that
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
maybe your department or similar
 
00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.670 align:start position:0%
maybe your department or similar
Department's

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
Department's
 
00:47:40.589 --> 00:47:40.599 align:start position:0%
experience the the electronic monitoring
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
um I mean it's something um you know
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
right now they're just they're just
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
walking out of the PD they're walking
 
00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
right out the door um domestic violence
 
00:47:59.069 --> 00:47:59.079 align:start position:0%
specifically um they're they're just
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
getting PR bail and walking out um and
 
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
you know I I prosecute also I'm an
 
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
attorney I prosecute for the PD
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
and the the amount of failure to appear
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
is at court through the roof and it's
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
just wasting time and if they were on
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
the monitor you'd know right where to go
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
pick them up if they failed to appear it
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
yeah I got a stack of failure to appears
 
00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
every every court appearance I made
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and I believe that as part of the
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
monitoring we're going to um as we write
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
it we'll leave it open for software or
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
whatever even perhaps through the
 
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
monitor they can be buzzed to notify to
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
your courts coming up I mean there's all
 
00:48:38.589 --> 00:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
kinds of technology so we want to make
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
sure that a we know where they are if
 
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
they're not supposed to be somewhere so
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
if you have a defendant who's been
 
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
arrested for trespassing at a store and
 
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
part of his bail conditions are not to
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
go back to that store you'll know
 
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
through the monitoring that he's back at
 
00:48:53.789 --> 00:48:53.799 align:start position:0%
that store and yet again violated his
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
bail conditions and you'll know right
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
where they are to to go pick them up so
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
do you feel like that um is a step in
 
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
the right direction towards helping yeah
 
00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
I do and I think uh specifically on the
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
um you know I go back to the domestic
 
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
violence again where there's a no
 
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
contact order um I think that will
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
protect the have some protection for the
 
00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
victim if the that defendant is out
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
there um because they're often times um
 
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
in violation of that no contact order
 
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
and the victim may be afraid to call the
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
police because he or she doesn't know
 
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen to set him off or
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
her off again right so the monitoring
 
00:49:31.549 --> 00:49:31.559 align:start position:0%
would notify um law enforcement that the
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
person is again within the Geo fenced
 
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
area that they're not supposed to be
 
00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
near that victim I'm not
 
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
too I'm not too versed on how these
 
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
bracelets work and how we would the
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
police would have access to them but
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
yeah the the court um what we're
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
contemplating is that um the court would
 
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
have to enter a contract with a company
 
00:49:53.789 --> 00:49:53.799 align:start position:0%
that monitors in the monitoring agency
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
would notify whoever the court tells to
 
00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
notify so if the court says as part of
 
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
your bail conditions you are not to go
 
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
within a th000 ft of this person's
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
residence or the police will be notified
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
that company would then notify the local
 
00:50:08.109 --> 00:50:08.119 align:start position:0%
police that that person had indeed
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
violated the conditions of that release
 
00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
yeah that that would be excellent so
 
00:50:14.589 --> 00:50:14.599 align:start position:0%
with regard to um further representative
 
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
Stone's question to you and as far as
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
being arrested and held if you are
 
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
arrested yet again after unveiled do you
 
00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
feel like that is um a beneficial
 
00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:26.799 align:start position:0%
proposal I I do I do and you
 
00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
know for a couple reasons is you know
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
the safety of the public and and for the
 
00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
assuring they're going to show up in
 
00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
court if
 
00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
they're out on bail and still committing
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
more crimes likely they're not going to
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
show up for court either yeah agree okay
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:46.760 align:start position:0%

no not a question thank you I just feel
 
00:50:58.829 --> 00:50:58.839 align:start position:0%
like I have to name that we heard a lot
 
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
during testimony about the lack of
 
00:51:03.789 --> 00:51:03.799 align:start position:0%
services available so you know even
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
though we're going to require bail
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to you know inform people
 
00:51:10.789 --> 00:51:10.799 align:start position:0%
about available Services there might not
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
be like services available to refer
 
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
people to um representative um rhs thank
 
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman in in reference to
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
representative Murray's
 
00:51:26.789 --> 00:51:26.799 align:start position:0%
comment you know we heard from a few of
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
the counties that do already have these
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
PR trial services and one of the things
 
00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned and I realized that I'm
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
preaching to quat to the choir with all
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
of you but I would just like to stress
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
to everybody here if your county does
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
not have these prechal Services you are
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
in a very very unique situation to
 
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
approach your County Commissioners and
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
get the conversation started I if it's
 
00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
happening in other counties it can
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
happen in all 10 and we have to be the
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
ones to make it make it happen and if
 
00:51:58.349 --> 00:51:58.359 align:start position:0%
you need to reach out to the other
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
counties to have them come to your
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
county I I I guarantee you chesher
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
County would do that and that's going to
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
be on all of us to make that be become a
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
reality also I think that um as we
 
00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
discussed one of the bills that we have
 
00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:18.280 align:start position:0%
we are going to repurpose to task the
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
existing inter Branch commission that
 
00:52:23.309 --> 00:52:23.319 align:start position:0%
worked on Bill in 2018 that commission
 
00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
still exists and we're going to ret ask
 
00:52:28.109 --> 00:52:28.119 align:start position:0%
that commission to come up with um
 
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
legislation and ideas to Institute
 
00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide um pre-trial Service as one of
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
their mandates so that issue is not
 
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
going to go away when we're done with
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
this professor Sher um a couple points
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
about uh what you've all been talking
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
about and I I appreciate the
 
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
committee's um efforts to sort through
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
this in a way that is productive just
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
briefly on the services issue I think uh
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of how
 
00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
how uh that recommendation is drafted
 
00:53:04.349 --> 00:53:04.359 align:start position:0%
and put in the legislation I Council
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
very strongly against putting the burden
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
on a individual on a defendant to get
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
Services when depending on the area it
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
may be very very uncertain whether those
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
services are available so I don't want
 
00:53:25.309 --> 00:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
to say to uh you know an individual you
 
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
need to go get these services and
 
00:53:30.789 --> 00:53:30.799 align:start position:0%
because they're in xounty those Serv are
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
available the recommendation was going
 
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
to be specific in other words you um XYZ
 
00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
um NGO is available for you to go talk
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
to and they it won't be just go find
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
some services and and and and in terms
 
00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
of services you know as representative
 
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
roads knows well um pre-trial Services
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
programs are funded by the county and I
 
00:53:53.789 --> 00:53:53.799 align:start position:0%
know cheser and straford County have
 
00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
more money because they're house housing
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh federal inmates and I think that
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
makes it very helpful for them uh
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
whereas you know Coos County and Carol
 
00:54:08.109 --> 00:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
County or in different circumstance um
 
00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh electronic monitoring uh
 
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:15.640 align:start position:0%
you know I'm upset two minds one um I
 
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
think uh giving electronic monitors to
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
everyone could be over Brad I mean
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
there's just some crimes just not going
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
to make any difference the crime doesn't
 
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
relate to trying to understand where
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
they are uh that said uh I understand
 
00:54:35.069 --> 00:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
the dynamic that the committee has uh
 
00:54:37.789 --> 00:54:37.799 align:start position:0%
has laid out and it allows for somebody
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
to be be released and so I I I get that
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
the one of the two key things that I
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
think are really
 
00:54:50.549 --> 00:54:50.559 align:start position:0%
important while the if somebody is found
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
third-party Agency for whom the court
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
contracts uh learns that a person has
 
00:55:01.309 --> 00:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
violated the strictures of the
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
electronic money they've gone somewhere
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have gone or what or they
 
00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
haven't showed up for court um and they
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
notify the court uh and the police they
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
that the court notifies the police to go
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
pick that person up I don't I think it
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be explicit in the legislation
 
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
that the police do not have access to
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
the all the electronic monitoring data
 
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
on that person from the time the monitor
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
was in place to the time they were
 
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
picked up I don't think we should create
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
a circumstance where the electronic
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
monitoring system is used as another
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
investigative tool for the police I I I
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
think it needs to be narrowly written so
 
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
that the the the only information the
 
00:55:53.589 --> 00:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
police get from the the third party via
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
the court is where this person is now
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
and that's all they have access to uh
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
they don't get to look at all the data
 
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
and figure out where um uh you know
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
other things use for investigative
 
00:56:08.589 --> 00:56:08.599 align:start position:0%
purposes I think that's very important
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
um let me just address that before you
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
move to the next Point um I think that
 
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839 align:start position:0%
that um that that does raise a good
 
00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
point I think that whatever in the
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
statute it it will say that the court
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
will authorize the information to the
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
police department for violations of the
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
terms of bail in other words if the term
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
of bail is you don't go here and you go
 
00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
here that information can be related to
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
the police department but the blanket
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
you know where this person is all day
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
long will not that's why we're not
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
having the police monitor it we're using
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
a third party I do believe however that
 
00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:49.480 align:start position:0%
if a proper warrant is obtained it
 
00:56:52.589 --> 00:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
should be made available um if if a
 
00:56:55.789 --> 00:56:55.799 align:start position:0%
search warrant is authorized and they're
 
00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
in uh I mean that's a difficult
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
situation uh I I have difficulty with
 
00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:03.400 align:start position:0%
that to be honest with you but we're not
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
going to put it in the thing but um I
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
imagine it'll get raised at some point
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
in the future in the future
 
00:57:15.549 --> 00:57:15.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.349 --> 00:57:20.359 align:start position:0%
I I think it's a big mistake to create a
 
00:57:23.029 --> 00:57:23.039 align:start position:0%
circumstance any circumstance in which
 
00:57:26.029 --> 00:57:26.039 align:start position:0%
the individual upon whom the electronic
 
00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
monitoring is uh placed
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
pays at the time after the fact people
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
in you know the large majority of people
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
involved in the criminal justice
 
00:57:41.789 --> 00:57:41.799 align:start position:0%
system um don't have
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
money um as I've said in all sorts of
 
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
different context they don't even have
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
the luxury of living paycheck to
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
paycheck and you know every little bit
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
is a problem you know uh the for example
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
the court coming after them for bail
 
00:58:03.029 --> 00:58:03.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner fees the penalty assessment
 
00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
that's used to fund certain things um
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts of fees put aside
 
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
getting fined put aside if you're
 
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
convicted having to reimburse the state
 
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
at a certain rate for uh for the council
 
00:58:22.349 --> 00:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
that you got Council that you got cuz
 
00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
you're poor uh and and and now you have
 
00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
to reimburse the state um there's all
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
sorts of these fees separate from fines
 
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
and restitution that pile up and um I
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
just you
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
know I don't like the idea that we're
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
just adding another fee you know 50
 
00:58:49.029 --> 00:58:49.039 align:start position:0%
bucks for everybody on this committee is
 
00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:51.400 align:start position:0%
a lot different than 50 bucks for a
 
00:58:56.190 --> 00:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
homeless person and and you know I
 
00:58:58.829 --> 00:58:58.839 align:start position:0%
I I don't think they should be punished
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
for having electronic
 
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
monitor we will take that under
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
advisement um I I would differ a little
 
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
bit I think that if they have the
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to pay they should be made
 
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
to pay if they're Indigent they should
 
00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
not um we shouldn't automatically put it
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
on the taxpayer who also is being buried
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
in taxes and fees on a daily bases as
 
00:59:24.029 --> 00:59:24.039 align:start position:0%
well and committed no crime so um but I
 
00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
I I do take your point and I think
 
00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
indent people obviously will will say if
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
you're indent you're indent and you
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
cannot get blood from a stone so um but
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
if someone does have the wherewith all
 
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
the pay I do not see why the taxpayer
 
00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't get
 
00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursed um un and and I understand uh
 
00:59:45.549 --> 00:59:45.559 align:start position:0%
uh the chair's perspective understanding
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
that the court system will say great
 
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
thanks another time I've got to figure
 
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:51.559 align:start position:0%
out whether this person has the ability
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
to pay or not could that not be done as
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
part of their um determination of
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
theory I think I'm going to leave it um
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
that it's broad enough for the court to
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
make the decision if they are already
 
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
doing a determination of Indy for
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not they can get councel I
 
01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:19.559 align:start position:0%
think at the same time that can say well
 
01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
if you can't afford councel you can't
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
afford monitoring and that yeah the
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
um no go on the the the the difficulty
 
01:00:29.599 --> 01:00:31.190 align:start position:0%
um no go on the the the the difficulty
there

01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
is to be
 
01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
blunt the huge majority of Judges say
 
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
well affording not being able to afford
 
01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:41.039 align:start position:0%
Council not being able to afford 5,000
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
bucks or a th000 bucks for a council or
 
01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
10,000 bucks is different than not being
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
able to afford 50 bucks I think every
 
01:00:53.309 --> 01:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
judge that I've talked to um will say
 
01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:55.640 align:start position:0%
everybody can afford 50 bucks you know
 
01:00:58.109 --> 01:00:58.119 align:start position:0%
it's that's that's my problem and it's
 
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
just the it's the accumulation of 50
 
01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
Buck amounts that that do some people in
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
what if we specifically tie it to um
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
eligibility for Council if you are
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
determined to be um eligible for public
 
01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:15.799 align:start position:0%
Council you are also determined not to
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
required to reimburse for the I'd feel a
 
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
you representative is waving his hand I
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
don't think he's just waving at me I
 
01:01:31.029 --> 01:01:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
may just
 
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
clarification would the uh first time
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
individual being bailed be an automatic
 
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
requirement for the electronic
 
01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
monitoring or be optional it's optional
 
01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
they can stay in jail if they want
 
01:01:44.029 --> 01:01:44.039 align:start position:0%
that's I just wanted to clarify that
 
01:01:47.789 --> 01:01:47.799 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah my understanding was the the
 
01:01:51.029 --> 01:01:51.039 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring was that the first
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
time somebody is arrested oh but it's
 
01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
their choice that's not true what no no
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
no it's it's the first time arrested
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
while on bail for another off yeah
 
01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what I don't I don't
 
01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
think we have the money to put it on
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
everybody um but no that the first
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
arrest while on bail they have an option
 
01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
take the take the monitoring or stay
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
with us and the next time that option is
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
not available and just I think this is
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
my last Point pick up on something
 
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:25.240 align:start position:0%
representative Muse was talking about
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
you know I I think some on the committee
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
know there's been some very valuable
 
01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:33.559 align:start position:0%
studies done at least a couple done
 
01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
about uh having a system set up where
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
you can text individuals that their
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
court date is coming up yeah um there's
 
01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
really good research that's been done
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
and and and the court system did a pilot
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
program out in Rochester that they got
 
01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
some good results from and then Co the
 
01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
pandemic hit and they had to unwind it
 
01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
and they still want to do it but they
 
01:02:58.750 --> 01:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
don't have the money to do it I would
 
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
love to as uh the uh as the companies
 
01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
are being investigated or the means of
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
doing electronic monitoring is
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
investigated you know I think it would
 
01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
be very very helpful if there was a
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
requirement that they had an ability to
 
01:03:20.349 --> 01:03:20.359 align:start position:0%
notify uh the individual who has the
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
electronic monitor at their court dates
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
coming up it's like a two
 
01:03:27.269 --> 01:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
you know you you you you reduce failures
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
to appear and you have the other
 
01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
benefits that the committee is looking
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
for for electronic monitoring I agree
 
01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
and um we are going to put that in there
 
01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
that's why I want to craft the
 
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
definition of electronic monitoring so
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
broadly that the court can use and
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
request funding for um any type of
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
technology that appears that's
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
successful to to help ensure people's
 
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
appearance and and their good
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
behavior thank you um you lied didn't
 
01:03:55.589 --> 01:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
you I did lie but well I didn't lie I'm
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
a law professor so I have the right to
 
01:03:59.950 --> 01:03:59.960 align:start position:0%
go on
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
forever he made it funny you
 
01:04:03.359 --> 01:04:08.190 align:start position:0%
forever he made it funny you
did

01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
um a reference to mobile crisis units
 
01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
I'm very familiar with mobile crisis
 
01:04:14.829 --> 01:04:14.839 align:start position:0%
units because we've been working very
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
closely um in psmith the police
 
01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
commission of which I'm a member has
 
01:04:20.549 --> 01:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
been working very closely with seos
 
01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
mental health and uh members of the
 
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
police department and others uh to
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
facilitate the use of seos the seos
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
mental health uh Coss mobile crisis unit
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
what they're for is they're
 
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
not really
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
for somebody's in court and the judge
 
01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
can refer them to the mobile crisis unit
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
what they're for is to be way too acute
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
they're for crisis yeah um that is uh
 
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
either the mobile pric unit or the
 
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
dispatcher for the police department
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
gets a call saying
 
01:04:58.349 --> 01:04:58.359 align:start position:0%
from uh say a family member that my uh
 
01:05:00.670 --> 01:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
spouse is in seems to be in a mental
 
01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
health crisis uh there'll be an initial
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh back and forth questioning uh of the
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
person calling in to determine whether
 
01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
there is uh a realistic uh possibility
 
01:05:17.269 --> 01:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
of danger to uh anyone um whether
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
weapons are involved or anything like
 
01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
that if not then in the first instance
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
uh the dispatch
 
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
will send uh uh will contact the mobile
 
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
crisis unit to go to that location which
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
involves mental health professionals it
 
01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't involve uniform police officers
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
showing up the point is they're not a
 
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
service that you refer they're not a
 
01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
service uh that the court can refer
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
people to gotcha I think that um it'll
 
01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:46.839 align:start position:0%
behoove the court to um to put out the
 
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
word that if you would like to have your
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
services offered to um defend ants
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
please let us know and we will pop
 
01:05:56.269 --> 01:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
related a sheet of people who can be
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
contacted and I think that'll be an
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
excellent exercise with the courts
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you representative uh
 
01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
Muse as we write the legislation one of
 
01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
the things that may be important is
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
making sure
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
that we put some guard rails around the
 
01:06:15.549 --> 01:06:15.559 align:start position:0%
use of the electronic monitoring data
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
and and the reason that I say that is it
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
because uh in Massachusetts there's
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
already been uh there's there's actually
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
already been a case where where the
 
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court there has ruled that um uh
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
essentially what the case involved was
 
01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
um the police looking at monitoring data
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
across a large number of people who had
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
monitoring bracelets to see if any of
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
the people being monitored were in were
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
in the vicinity of a robbery that took
 
01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
place uh as it turns out yes one of them
 
01:06:52.029 --> 01:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
was in the v was in the vicinity uh and
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
was arrested and they actually
 
01:06:53.359 --> 01:06:54.789 align:start position:0%
was arrested and they actually
disallowed

01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
disallowed
 
01:06:59.230 --> 01:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
that uh that uh uh particular arrest and
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh and the reason uh they said is that
 
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
going forward um the Commonwealth has to
 
01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
demonstrate on the particular facts of
 
01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
each individual case that warrantless
 
01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
monitoring is reasonable to justify the
 
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
attachment of a GPS ankle bracelet so
 
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:23.799 align:start position:0%
know one one of the things I think that
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
we that we need to consider is um in
 
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
this state we have a court system that's
 
01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
especially um I think that probably
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
guards privacy rights uh maybe even more
 
01:07:38.589 --> 01:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
carefully than Massachusetts does uh and
 
01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
it's just something I think that we need
 
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
to be aware of as we put this put this
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
together that um that
 
01:07:50.589 --> 01:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
establishing a blanket requirement
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
um may get us into legal and
 
01:07:56.109 --> 01:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues down the road I
 
01:07:58.029 --> 01:07:58.039 align:start position:0%
don't know what what would your opinion
 
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
be on that um
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
you're you know you're going to get me
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
going again but
 
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
um I apologize representative roades um
 
01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
in 2018 the New Hampshire legislature
 
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
and the voting public passed a new
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment that said uh uh
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh an an individual's right to be free
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
from government that an individual's
 
01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
right to be free from governmental
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
intrusion on personal and private
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
information is natural essential uh and
 
01:08:32.829 --> 01:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
inherent that is basically an
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
information privacy Constitutional
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
Amendment Massachusetts doesn't even
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
have that and there that opinion came
 
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
out that way it's a new Constitutional
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment that is still early and courts
 
01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:46.759 align:start position:0%
haven't been interpreting it but having
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
been the author of that Constitutional
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh you know I think it's a
 
01:08:54.269 --> 01:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
very expansive language and and it's
 
01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
going to protect privacy rights in New
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as to personal or private
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
information more than any other state
 
01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
does I mean it there's no other state
 
01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
that has that so I think you know
 
01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
the the electronic monitoring issue and
 
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
police having access even through a
 
01:09:17.349 --> 01:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
search warrant to that data is is going
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
to be a a big issue um and I just I
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
don't intend to right um that they can
 
01:09:27.309 --> 01:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
have access to a search warrant I
 
01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
anticipate at some point someone is
 
01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:30.759 align:start position:0%
going to apply for a search warrant and
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
try to get it and we will leave it up to
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
the courts to interpret the the um
 
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
constitutionality that in light of the
 
01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
new Amendment so I think that they um
 
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
they need to tell us what they think of
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
it and but as far as um letting that
 
01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
information representative Muse and your
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
point is is well taken and I don't
 
01:09:52.269 --> 01:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
anticipate allowing broad access I think
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
only notifications will be be violations
 
01:09:56.910 --> 01:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
of bail conditions that were set and
 
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
that should suffice for what we're
 
01:09:59.950 --> 01:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
remember we have to keep in mind what
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
our goal is to ensure that someone
 
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
complies with the conditions of their
 
01:10:06.189 --> 01:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
bail since they apparently didn't to be
 
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
arrested yet again so the only
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
information that should be shared is
 
01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
when there is a violation of the bail
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
and specifically that information only
 
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
and they it's not mandated they do have
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
the choice to say I don't want it and
 
01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
stay in jail and I would specifically uh
 
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
ask that in in the legislation in that
 
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
regard the only information being shared
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
is the location of the violation rather
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
than broadly anything more broad oh yeah
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I well I couldn't see there'd be no
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh probative value in giving them the
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
whole days worth all they need to know
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
is when the violation occurred and where
 
01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
yep agreed representative Pratt we went
 
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
over texting the person that uh a court
 
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
date is curring ing I've never been
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
arrested so I don't know do they get a
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
letter that says they have a court
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
date uh they are no in the better courts
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
told when their court date is uh
 
01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
depending uh a lot of people don't hear
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
that given the stress that they're under
 
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
circumstance um uh and and and I believe
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
they I'm not the best person to talk to
 
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
but I believe they are uh provided with
 
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
a letter but there's some people who
 
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
don't don't
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
have an address at which they pick up
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
mail okay I'd be in favor of the text in
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
addition to a letter but not in place of
 
01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.110 align:start position:0%
addition to a letter but not in place of
a

01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
letter yeah the second part of my
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't a test for indigen CB they
 
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
can afford a phone and service I know
 
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
people that work for a living that can't
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
afford a phone and but they're not
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
injured in let me just answer that if I
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
could um the federal government now
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
gives away phones um so um I don't know
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
that your friends would qualify because
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
they do work so that's that's a bigger
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
discussion for another body I think um
 
01:12:12.669 --> 01:12:12.679 align:start position:0%
but yeah they all have phones um and if
 
01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:14.679 align:start position:0%
they don't it's probably because they
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
need um other services because they are
 
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
not aware of the fact that the
 
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
government is giving away phones um I
 
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
was not aware of that the government oh
 
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah they do um any any further no
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you okay oh you I'm sorry did
 
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
you oh hello did you want to say
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
space good morning good morning um so
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
I'm Sarah Rothman I'm the executive
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire public
 
01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
defender um I just wanted to to make sh
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
two short points one is um I and I don't
 
01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
hear that this is being said today but I
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
just moving forward I I with regard to
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring sometimes as these
 
01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
programs evolve it requires the
 
01:13:04.629 --> 01:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
defendant to have an address um that you
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
you won't qualify for electronic
 
01:13:08.629 --> 01:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
monitoring unless you have a home
 
01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
address um and so I would like to urge
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
the committee not to adopt any
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that would exclude probably
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
the very people that were trying to
 
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
capture um the people who struggle with
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
homelessness um maybe not a lot of them
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
full on homelessness but some of them
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
just transients um you know staying here
 
01:13:27.790 --> 01:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
for a few weeks and there for a few
 
01:13:30.669 --> 01:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
weeks um and so I I just don't want to
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
go down that slippery slope that we
 
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
often see with electronic monitoring um
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
that the very people who would benefit
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
most for it end up not qualifying for it
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
um the the other point I wanted to make
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
um is to urge the committee to consider
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the sort of outline that
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
that you've presented with you know if
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
the first time you were arrested while
 
01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
out on bail you get this choice for
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring or hold I would
 
01:13:58.189 --> 01:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to consider um kind
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
of saying that that is for if you're
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
rearrested for you know a felony um
 
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
offense um to kind of craft it more
 
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
specifically than just any offense while
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
you're out on bail and potentially if
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
there are you know misdemeanor level
 
01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
offenses particularly domestic violence
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
related offenses that you did want to
 
01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
enumerate that you be more specific than
 
01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
just kind of any arrest um while you're
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
out on bail um because the volume and I
 
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
I know kind of here and lies the point
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
right like that that this is a large
 
01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
volume of people and that is what the
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
committee is is hoping to address um so
 
01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
I am cognizant of that but at the same
 
01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:35.080 align:start position:0%
time it's a large volume of people that
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
you are talking about like it is it is a
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
large volume of people um and I think as
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
Professor Sher has indicated not all of
 
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
those people even law enforcement would
 
01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
agree you know would benefit from
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring um and so as you
 
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
draft legislation I would urge you to
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
consider you know being specific about
 
01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
what level of offense or what categories
 
01:14:59.470 --> 01:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
of offenses um this would trigger and
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
and to your point here in Eli the
 
01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
problem the the the reason we're
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
actually here in my opinion more so than
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
all these serious crimes is these
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
repetitive crimes um that are low-level
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
um trespass trespass trespass um
 
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
shoplift shoplift shoplift and if we say
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
okay only felonies they're going to keep
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
walking out the door um and some point
 
01:15:25.629 --> 01:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
and and maybe more than anything we're
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
trying to force the court to address
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
this and say you know fix this we we
 
01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
cannot just keep turning these people
 
01:15:34.189 --> 01:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
loose to come back come back before you
 
01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
the um police departments aren't goalies
 
01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
just kicking people back into play we
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
have to find a way to address it um and
 
01:15:43.629 --> 01:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
as much as I I would like to narrow it
 
01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
and I will contemplate and take your
 
01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
your um testimony under advis and I just
 
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
we we're struggling with a way to do
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
that which still does what the public is
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
demand we do it's we're kind of caught
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
between a rock and a hard place but
 
01:16:00.629 --> 01:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
we're still we're still thinking and if
 
01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
you have ideas yeah I'm happy to hear
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
them representative Reed thank you just
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
a basically a comment um I we were on
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
the um adult uh parole board study
 
01:16:11.709 --> 01:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
committee and they found that you know
 
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
the high utilizers were the ones that
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
were two and a half times more likely to
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
be booked for for you know infractions
 
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
um and five or more entrances on average
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
beside the nonh high utilizer so I think
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
this would really impact that the people
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
were trying to to reach the
 
01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
most so I think at the end of the day
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
and I can speak for just about everyone
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
in here the the problem is the lack of
 
01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:41.149 align:start position:0%
in here the the problem is the lack of
of

01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:16:41.159 --> 01:16:42.750 align:start position:0%
of
resources

01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
that address what is causing these
 
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
people to offend defend defend um and
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
the only way we're going to get there is
 
01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
to take a Step In One Direction and um
 
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to revitalize that study
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
committee commission and mandate that
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
they find an answer to that um be it
 
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide pre-trial something so that we
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
can intervene before these patterns of
 
01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
arrest keep
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
continuing anything else any questions
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
just briefly kind of on that point in
 
01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
terms of creating a flyer of sorts to be
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
handed out by bail Commissioners um the
 
01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
public defender is more than happy to be
 
01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
involved in that process we have social
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
workers on staff who already have those
 
01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
kinds of materials you know that we give
 
01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
to our clients and so we're happy to
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
share and collaborate on that excellent
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you we will um we will U
 
01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
look at putting that in there that
 
01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
entities representative rhods thank you
 
01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.709 align:start position:0%
entities representative rhods thank you
Mr

01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
chairman the this is probably not going
 
01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
to be a very popular thing and I
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
apologize upfront but
 
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.709 align:start position:0%
apologize upfront but
listen

01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
listen
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
we are not going to be able to make
 
01:17:58.830 --> 01:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
everybody happy you know I don't I don't
 
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
agree with my husband 100% of the time
 
01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
is if you are rearrested while you're
 
01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
already on bail that that itself is a
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
crime and we're trying really hard to
 
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
keep people out of jail but we we can't
 
01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
want to keep people out of jail more
 
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
than they want to be kept out of jail
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
and you know there's a difference
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
between an excuse and a reason and has
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
to be some accountability right and we
 
01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
as a society are taking a lot of
 
01:18:30.910 --> 01:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
accountability with all the programs
 
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to do with coming up
 
01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
with this you know this option other
 
01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.350 align:start position:0%
with this you know this option other
than

01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:38.990 align:start position:0%
than
incarceration

01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
incarceration
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
and we can't we can't fix every social
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
problem right that these are things that
 
01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
are starting in the
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
home and you know here we are trying to
 
01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
deal with it so I think everybody what I
 
01:18:52.629 --> 01:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
would like is everybody to take a step
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
back and realize we're we're we're not
 
01:18:57.310 --> 01:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
all going to be happy and what we've
 
01:18:59.070 --> 01:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
come up with in this committee is more
 
01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
than anything anybody else
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
has and I I think we just all need to
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
focus on
 
01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
that thank you I think it's worth noting
 
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
um that that that that's very accurate
 
01:19:15.149 --> 01:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
but at the same time um people in this
 
01:19:18.189 --> 01:19:18.199 align:start position:0%
room know that they're there's two
 
01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
societies and most people don't realize
 
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
it but there are two societies there's
 
01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:23.629 align:start position:0%
it but there are two societies there's
us

01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
um who are here functioning and and
 
01:19:27.870 --> 01:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
rational and we we plan vacations and we
 
01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
plan for our retirement and there's
 
01:19:32.629 --> 01:19:32.639 align:start position:0%
another Society within our society that
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
lives minute to minute dayto Day meal to
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
meal and they just don't have the
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
ability or capability to to understand
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
and make those kind of decisions so when
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
you and I are faced with a choice of
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
should I do this or should I not we
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
think out the ramifications whereas they
 
01:19:52.590 --> 01:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
think well I'll still get the meal and
 
01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
I'll deal with that later so I think
 
01:19:56.910 --> 01:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
that we have to always keep in mind that
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
not everyone operates on the same plane
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
of um
 
01:20:05.229 --> 01:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
of responsibility as they should just to
 
01:20:08.669 --> 01:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
to oh sorry go ahead represent
 
01:20:08.679 --> 01:20:10.189 align:start position:0%
to oh sorry go ahead represent
Murray

01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
Murray
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
um I I definitely agree we're not going
 
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
to come up with something that
 
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to be 100% on and I
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
think we're doing a good job
 
01:20:19.149 --> 01:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
compromising so far and I appreciate all
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
of you in in this process um I did want
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
um I think one misdemeanor in particular
 
01:20:29.709 --> 01:20:29.719 align:start position:0%
that I have a hard time like seeing
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
being impacted by this is trespassing
 
01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
because of the amount of houseless
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
people that have no option but to
 
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
trespass um you know whether that's
 
01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
staying in a public park over the night
 
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
or you know being on a sidewalk um and I
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
just don't think that you know holding
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
those people and jail or giving them
 
01:20:49.229 --> 01:20:49.239 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring is going to stop
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
them from something that they're doing
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
because of their circumstances that
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
they're in so maybe if there's like
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
maybe if we're not um you know saying
 
01:21:03.629 --> 01:21:03.639 align:start position:0%
specific um offenses that are going to
 
01:21:05.709 --> 01:21:05.719 align:start position:0%
be that this is going to apply to then
 
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
maybe we can say certain offenses that
 
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
this is not going to apply to um I know
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
maybe not everyone will feel the same
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
way but it feels like difficult to
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
punish people for something that they
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
don't really have a choice in especially
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
if you know it's in an area where there
 
01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
isn't a shelter or any place for them to
 
01:21:22.239 --> 01:21:23.310 align:start position:0%
isn't a shelter or any place for them to
stay

01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
stay
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's just a concern of mine
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and that's that's a worthy
 
01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.229 align:start position:0%
thank you and that's that's a worthy
concern

01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:21:33.149 --> 01:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
um at the same time those are the the
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
the the store owners who are calling
 
01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
saying you know this person's back in my
 
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
doorway again because there might be
 
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
heat coming up from the sidewalk there
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's difficult um I think we
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
have to ensure that where there are
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
services available for people shelters
 
01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
Etc that the the they're made aware of
 
01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
it and perhaps even you know given
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation there if possible um
 
01:21:59.310 --> 01:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
versus just cut loose again and say now
 
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
don't trespass again um and I'm not
 
01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
without although I I wonder with winter
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
coming if there some of them aren't
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
better off being able to have a place to
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
stay then then being sent back out into
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
the cold representative Stone thank you
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that we always seem
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
to forget to mention is the victims and
 
01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of these crimes do have victims uh
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
some of them do not but a majority of
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
them do and we we very rarely speak of
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
victims in this committee and one of the
 
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
things we're trying to balance out I
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
think is weighing out do process uh
 
01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
presumption and innocence while also
 
01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
respecting the victim's rights
 
01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
trespassing can have a victim or cannot
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
have a victim I think it's injurious if
 
01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
we decide to say well for trespassing
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to skip it all together but
 
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to go to uh shoplifting uh
 
01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
some other minor misdemeanor offenses
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor offenses felony offenses are
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
classified for a reason I don't think we
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
should pick and choose choose which ones
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to enforce which ones we're
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
not going to enforce no I I think that
 
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
first of all to to your first comment um
 
01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
the reason that we have narrowed it down
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
to these things and we've said okay we
 
01:23:07.629 --> 01:23:07.639 align:start position:0%
have no tolerance on after your second
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
arrest um and and frankly that you have
 
01:23:12.669 --> 01:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
a choice to wear the monitor or be
 
01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
incarcerated is because of the victims
 
01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
that's why we're doing this um in
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
trespassing as I said with regard to the
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
store owner generally does have a victim
 
01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not it impacts them you know
 
01:23:26.430 --> 01:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
someone who has a a storage facility
 
01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
isn't as impacted as someone who's
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
trying to run a business but they're
 
01:23:31.470 --> 01:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
still a victim and it's their privacy
 
01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
and their property so I I I think that
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to balance that um
 
01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm putting such an emphasis
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
on making sure that people are connected
 
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
with services at the time of the first
 
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
arrest so if they say hey I'm homeless
 
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
well we have a shelter here um that's
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
available and you can stay there um
 
01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
versus verus just saying okay we'll back
 
01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
outside don't go back there again um but
 
01:23:59.870 --> 01:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
I agree about not picking offenses
 
01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you we've all
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
society's always had the marginal um
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
people that that struggled with things
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
um it just seems to have exploded
 
01:24:13.709 --> 01:24:13.719 align:start position:0%
exponentially so back in the the day we
 
01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
used to have higher standards you know
 
01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
that PE and people you set the bar High
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
people will try to achieve it you set
 
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
limits people will try and I think we
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
need to get back to that for Public
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
Safety we need to set the bar higher for
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
people to meet um and not just uh you
 
01:24:34.110 --> 01:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
know give them a free run all the time I
 
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
I agree um and I'd agree wholeheartedly
 
01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
if we could reach into society and take
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
all the fenel out um but until we can
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
we're not dealing with um people who are
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
able to set a higher standard for
 
01:24:48.030 --> 01:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
themselves because they're addicted and
 
01:24:52.109 --> 01:24:52.119 align:start position:0%
and to Sure join the conversation um to
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
with apologies to representative roads
 
01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.990 align:start position:0%
with apologies to representative roads
um

01:24:58.990 --> 01:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:03.149 --> 01:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
the I always kind of seiz up when we
 
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
talk about the way things used to be
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
Grime rate in New Hampshire is
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
significantly lower after baill reform
 
01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
than it was before baill reform so I I I
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
just want to put this in context this is
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
not this is not a matter of this never
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
seen before crime wave taking over New
 
01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of Bale reform I know
 
01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
this committee by and large understands
 
01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
that uh but I think the general public
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't understand it and I think what's
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
good about where we are now is in
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
addition to crafting domestic violence
 
01:25:48.189 --> 01:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
laws and other uh other laws that pay
 
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
attention to uh the victims or the
 
01:25:53.790 --> 01:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
alleged victims in cases we also looking
 
01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
at the people in that second society
 
01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
that the chair refers to who in in many
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
ways are as much victims uh uh as uh the
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
victims of a specific crime in terms
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
of um the failures of society to create
 
01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
the set of Social Services that can that
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
can that can uh address the issues and
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
you know the the challenge for this
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
committee which fortunately I don't have
 
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
but the challenge for this committee is
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
to not impose too many of the
 
01:26:29.550 --> 01:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
imperfections of this two Society world
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
not impose responsibility for those too
 
01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
much of it on uh criminal defendants and
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh make us feel better that we're
 
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
dealing with the problem but we're not
 
01:26:43.109 --> 01:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
actually uh dealing with those people
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
were imposing uh things on them so
 
01:26:49.390 --> 01:26:49.400 align:start position:0%
that's you know I in deference to
 
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative Rosel shut up now thank
 
01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:53.750 align:start position:0%
representative Rosel shut up now thank
you

01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
um representative wheeler you Mr
 
01:26:57.870 --> 01:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
chairman I just want to say I'm
 
01:26:59.590 --> 01:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
surprised to hear you paraphrasing
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
Martin Luther King and talking about two
 
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
Americas but it's true there's America
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
of wealth and prosperity and opportunity
 
01:27:08.669 --> 01:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
and there's an America of living minute
 
01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
to minute and and on the street and and
 
01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
without and uh I think that problem is
 
01:27:16.629 --> 01:27:16.639 align:start position:0%
much larger and much steeper than the
 
01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire criminal justice and
 
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
Public Safety Committee can necessarily
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
deal with um and as much as we
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
as legislators in a broader sense should
 
01:27:26.430 --> 01:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely try to push for those more
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
Social Services I think what we can do
 
01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
in this committee is just ensure that
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice system is actually
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
a system uh and functions in a in a
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
proper way and I think the compromise of
 
01:27:39.390 --> 01:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring in a
 
01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional way that appropriately uh
 
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
addresses what we're seeing here in
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
people being rearrested on bail without
 
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
throwing them and locking away the key
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
in the prison is an appropriate
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
compromise and I'm appreciative of your
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
work and representative goth right's
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
work on this end and getting us to this
 
01:28:00.430 --> 01:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
point and emphasizing that we need and
 
01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:03.669 align:start position:0%
point and emphasizing that we need and
representative

01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:05.470 --> 01:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
roads I
 
01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.390 align:start position:0%
roads I
[Laughter]

01:28:07.390 --> 01:28:07.400 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
am I am and getting us to this point and
 
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
I and I appreciate your emphasis on the
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
social services as well I am because I
 
01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
think that's where we need to be going
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
and and the criminal justice committee
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that we can't deal with
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
every issue I I think has done a really
 
01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
uh decent job in ensuring that we take a
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
huge step forward and getting us to
 
01:28:32.189 --> 01:28:32.199 align:start position:0%
solving some of these issues so I
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you um I I you
 
01:28:37.149 --> 01:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
should not be surprised however I uh I
 
01:28:39.229 --> 01:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
have read Dr King and I have my great
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
respect for his work um I I I think that
 
01:28:45.149 --> 01:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
you know there's an old saying every
 
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
when you're a hammer everything is a
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
nail and we are a criminal justice
 
01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
committee not a social services
 
01:28:53.950 --> 01:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
committee and we are trying to deal with
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
um issues that really um a lot of them
 
01:28:58.830 --> 01:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
are social issues and not criminal
 
01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
justice issues so we have to be very
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
careful to try and not deal with social
 
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
issues as crimes so we're it's it's it's
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
a very fine line we're walking to try
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
and at keep the public safe um ensure
 
01:29:15.629 --> 01:29:15.639 align:start position:0%
that victims of crime are see Justice at
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
the same time not punish people for the
 
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
the society that we created for them to
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
live in so um we're working on it one
 
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
day at a time representative Stone thank
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
you one of the questions I have is you
 
01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:35.480 align:start position:0%
bring up your data from 2018 and how we
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
have reduction in crime does any of that
 
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
studies indicate the deficiencies of law
 
01:29:42.109 --> 01:29:42.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies been able to
 
01:29:44.109 --> 01:29:44.119 align:start position:0%
recruit hire and retain police officers
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
obviously less police officers means
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
less on the roadless uh crime that
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
they're actually arresting on the the
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
data I I'm referring to is FBI data
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
um which is accessible on uh crime data
 
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
Explorer famar thank you um and um uh it
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh reflect that my experience in
 
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth on the police commission
 
01:30:12.109 --> 01:30:12.119 align:start position:0%
is uh there is we are we are down at
 
01:30:15.149 --> 01:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
this point uh we're we're slotted for 70
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
officers budgeted for 70 officers we uh
 
01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
last check we had 64 and you know we had
 
01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:22.510 align:start position:0%
last check we had 64 and you know we had
another

01:30:22.510 --> 01:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
a number in the hiring pipeline the
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
conversations I've had with the uh Chief
 
01:30:29.229 --> 01:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
the deputy chief and and the captains do
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
not indicate that uh they're unable to
 
01:30:37.870 --> 01:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh investigate crimes or arrest
 
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
people because of the uh the the the six
 
01:30:45.310 --> 01:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
people who aren't there it hasn't
 
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
affected uh those kind of services it
 
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
affects other kinds of services it means
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
that the department is spending way more
 
01:30:56.109 --> 01:30:56.119 align:start position:0%
money uh much to the displeasure of the
 
01:30:59.109 --> 01:30:59.119 align:start position:0%
city council on overtime so the shifts
 
01:31:01.629 --> 01:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
are being covered uh the jobs are being
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
done but we're we're uh working our
 
01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:07.639 align:start position:0%
officers to the bone with and they're
 
01:31:11.229 --> 01:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
doing overtime that's the experience in
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
Portsmith I can't speak for any other
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
police department representative Stone
 
01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
though I think that there probably is an
 
01:31:18.910 --> 01:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
aspect of that in other areas where
 
01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
there are significant um significant um
 
01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
Staffing show problems that being said I
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
I do think that what we are dealing with
 
01:31:33.109 --> 01:31:33.119 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily A Statewide spiking
 
01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
crime but a very focused area in
 
01:31:39.109 --> 01:31:39.119 align:start position:0%
particularly highly populated areas
 
01:31:42.189 --> 01:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
where there are a need for services and
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of people that um are
 
01:31:47.709 --> 01:31:47.719 align:start position:0%
ryant on public services where you are
 
01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
seeing these spike in these nuisance
 
01:31:51.709 --> 01:31:51.719 align:start position:0%
crimes I'm talking about with the the TR
 
01:31:53.149 --> 01:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
trespassing the shoplifting the things
 
01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
of that nature and that's why you're
 
01:31:58.430 --> 01:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
seeing uh actually um the prime sponsor
 
01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
of the bill in the Senate was from
 
01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester so I I think that it it's
 
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
evident that while there may not be a
 
01:32:06.510 --> 01:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
spike in crime there's a there's a
 
01:32:08.669 --> 01:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
there's a spike in in in the clash
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
between the two societies I spoke of
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
that um needs addressing and
 
01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we won't be able to
 
01:32:18.030 --> 01:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
address it fully with criminal justice
 
01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
because that's not what we should do um
 
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't want to start a
 
01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
whole back and forth on this because I
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
don't know you know how productive it is
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
and I know we're all trying our best to
 
01:32:33.149 --> 01:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
come up with Solutions here but I'm I'm
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
really just stuck on this houseless
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
people and the trespassing thing even if
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
we made it like trespassing on public
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
property instead of private property or
 
01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
something like that but I think when
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about victims like these
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
people are are victims too they're
 
01:32:49.109 --> 01:32:49.119 align:start position:0%
victims of society I've had um I was
 
01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
lucky enough to buy my first house with
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
my husband last last year and since that
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
time I've had three different friends
 
01:32:58.030 --> 01:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
stay with me who because they became
 
01:32:59.470 --> 01:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
houseless who had never experienced
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
houselessness before because the state
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
of our economy is just crazy right now
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know people can't afford to live and
 
01:33:07.149 --> 01:33:07.159 align:start position:0%
people who have never been in these
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
situations before are now becoming
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
houseless and I think that's why we're
 
01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
seeing you know an expanse in this area
 
01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
if anything is because people simply
 
01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
can't afford to live so for example one
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
of my friends had a child and was living
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
in her car you know to arrest her and
 
01:33:24.189 --> 01:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
you know charge her with trespassing put
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
her on electronic monitoring all the
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
stuff like how is that going to solve
 
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
anything with a young mom trying to take
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
care of her and her child and I know we
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
can't as a committee address um all the
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
social side and like Services side of
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
these things but I also want to keep us
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
from making the situation worse for some
 
01:33:45.149 --> 01:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
of these people and I think we should
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
try as hard as we can to like thread the
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
needle and figure out you know the
 
01:33:52.510 --> 01:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
issues where like shoplifting there's a
 
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
clear you know victim that someone is
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
being you know harmed in that case um
 
01:33:59.629 --> 01:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
with uh trespassing and no there
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
definitely can be too but I just think
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
it's either not as severe or not like as
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
often like in Manchester it's often
 
01:34:07.229 --> 01:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
people staying in the park you know and
 
01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
that's yeah and that's not harming
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
anyone and I also you know am the reper
 
01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
who lives in Manchester I also work
 
01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
downtown in Manchester I bartend at
 
01:34:18.990 --> 01:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
night it's not a problem for me to come
 
01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
into my shift and be like persons you
 
01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
know who spent the night in the doorway
 
01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
please move we're opening now no big
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
deal here's some water get on your way
 
01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
at the end of the night give them
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
leftover food move on with my day like
 
01:34:33.189 --> 01:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
that's not I'm not a victim in that
 
01:34:35.790 --> 01:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
situation because someone the you know
 
01:34:37.149 --> 01:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
best way they can get out of the cold to
 
01:34:39.149 --> 01:34:39.159 align:start position:0%
sleep in our doorway at night and so I
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
just really want us to like think about
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
how we cannot make the situation worse
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
in the way we're trying to address this
 
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that we can't actually
 
01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
always provide the solution in this
 
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
committee and I know it's a tricky B
 
01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
balance but I'm just trying to bring
 
01:34:55.709 --> 01:34:55.719 align:start position:0%
like that human centered approach here
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
someone who has again like a lot of
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
friends who have become houseless over
 
01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
the past year thank you I think that's a
 
01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
very good point to oh and I was about to
 
01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
ask the captain but he left um the
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
number of arrests that are rearrests for
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
um trespassing did you want to add not
 
01:35:14.189 --> 01:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
to that point actually something that's
 
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
occurred to me as I've been sitting here
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of the legislation I think that
 
01:35:20.430 --> 01:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
we talked about or you've talked about
 
01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
you know providing them with information
 
01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
about Services I think also though I
 
01:35:25.870 --> 01:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
think they're going to have to be
 
01:35:27.070 --> 01:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
defendants are going to need to be
 
01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
provided with information about
 
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring before they make
 
01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
that decision and so I do think that
 
01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
that should be part of the legislation
 
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
that they'll be required to be informed
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh what the expectations are if there's
 
01:35:42.990 --> 01:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
potential costs associated and then you
 
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
know I certainly agree with Professor
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
sher's thoughts about the availability
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
of this data to law enforcement um and
 
01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
you know if that's potentially going to
 
01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
be subject to a search warrant which I I
 
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
don't agree with but if that would
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
happen then I think they need to be
 
01:35:58.709 --> 01:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
notified of that before they make the
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
decision so I I think that should be
 
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
required that they are informed of those
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
rights and and sign off on it I I agree
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
that there will be a uh some type of a
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
form that says if by accepting this I
 
01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
understand ABC D D um and as I told the
 
01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
professor I'm have no contemplation of
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
putting in there that this is accessible
 
01:36:20.229 --> 01:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
by search warrants one way or the other
 
01:36:22.030 --> 01:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
but like any data that's available
 
01:36:24.030 --> 01:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
anywhere the police can apply for a
 
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
search warrant whether or not the court
 
01:36:28.030 --> 01:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
grants it is a decision up to the court
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
I could we could say we're going to Bar
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
it um but in that case I could be
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
causing another harm later where it
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
could end up being the key to a murder
 
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
case that I don't I don't want to get
 
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
into that right now um and I would
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
rather let the courts decide whether or
 
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
not that's properly accessible or not
 
01:36:47.109 --> 01:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
sure but in terms of notification to the
 
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
defendant I think he would need to be
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
notified that that's at least a
 
01:36:53.709 --> 01:36:53.719 align:start position:0%
potential yeah um before he agrees yeah
 
01:36:58.270 --> 01:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
I agree yeah okay so at this point I
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
think we've discussed this um enough and
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask for again like I did
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday an informal vote so that we
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
can send this language um May I address
 
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%
the committee very shortly yes okay um
 
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
first representative uh prad when
 
01:37:17.709 --> 01:37:17.719 align:start position:0%
someone is arrested they're giving uh
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
please stick around I have a question
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
for um
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
you get something called what you need
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
to know and it lists the charge the your
 
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
court date Court location gives you
 
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
information about a bail commissioner
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
your and your right to an attorney in
 
01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
addition you're given a copy of the bail
 
01:37:40.830 --> 01:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
order which is your legal promise to
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
show up your legal promise to abide by
 
01:37:46.270 --> 01:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
the conditions of bail and it is your
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
release document okay so the people when
 
01:37:52.510 --> 01:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
they leave they'll sometimes ask am I
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
going to get a notification here it is
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
they're they are
 
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
informed it seems to me uh that we have
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
this elaborate
 
01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
Machinery uh that is
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
unnecessary uh as before I develop that
 
01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
point uh there's a huge difference
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
between electronic monitoring for
 
01:38:21.669 --> 01:38:21.679 align:start position:0%
um misdemeanor and for an aggravated
 
01:38:24.669 --> 01:38:24.679 align:start position:0%
felonius assault I think we you need to
 
01:38:28.270 --> 01:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
separate here's why this Machinery
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
sounds good so did felonies first and we
 
01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
know what happened to it I live in the
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:40.910 align:start position:0%
 
particularly

01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:51.229 --> 01:38:51.239 align:start position:0%
the right now I signed arrest warrant
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
for people who bail jump okay when do
 
01:38:57.790 --> 01:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
they get picked up there's the people
 
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
live in town they live neighboring
 
01:39:02.669 --> 01:39:02.679 align:start position:0%
communities there some of them athu and
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
we can't reach them and the police sort
 
01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
of I I they're they're loaded with work
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
they don't go after these people the way
 
01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
they usually get pulled in is if they
 
01:39:17.790 --> 01:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
have another they're
 
01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
caught speeding and they run the car
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
then they see they out a bail J then
 
01:39:26.229 --> 01:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
they bring them in but it's it's I can't
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
say they never go to the house to get
 
01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
them but it's
 
01:39:33.669 --> 01:39:33.679 align:start position:0%
exceptional so what I'm S I believe this
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
is a problem that needs to be handled at
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
a higher level mainly post trial not
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
pre-trial as important and essential as
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
pre-trial is I'm wholeheartedly for that
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm a narrowing and here's where I'm
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
going with why I want to ask uh
 
01:39:55.870 --> 01:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
Professor sherff my uh understanding is
 
01:39:59.950 --> 01:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
correct if you are arrested and on this
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
what you need to know there's an RSA I
 
01:40:04.669 --> 01:40:04.679 align:start position:0%
wish I had one with it's in the car it
 
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
says if you're arrested on a a second
 
01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
time when you're on bail they don't need
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner they Polie have the
 
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
the unilateral right to take you to jail
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
period and you see a judge so my
 
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
solution is I don't understand I really
 
01:40:25.589 --> 01:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
I don't see it in my jurisdiction the
 
01:40:28.669 --> 01:40:28.679 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in which I work of this one
 
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
after the the I don't get that I don't
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
see it and it's up the second time they
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
go to jail period well obviously that's
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
not correct we heard the testimony from
 
01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
the Manchester police chief we heard the
 
01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
testimony from uh several Chiefs who
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
said that they have a revolving door of
 
01:40:47.790 --> 01:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
people coming in getting arrested be
 
01:40:51.229 --> 01:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
released res so Salem may be different
 
01:40:53.229 --> 01:40:53.239 align:start position:0%
but Manchester certainly not I'm going
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
hold on when this revolving door it's
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
not being done by bail commission why
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
aren't they being seen by a judge and
 
01:41:03.629 --> 01:41:03.639 align:start position:0%
moved up in the process there's
 
01:41:06.430 --> 01:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
something very loose about the way all
 
01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
of this is being portrayed and I
 
01:41:11.589 --> 01:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
challenge you to think about this in
 
01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
revolving door who's doing this
 
01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
revolving door why don't they see it the
 
01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
second time if I see somebody if I as if
 
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
it's a completely different crime which
 
01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
I almost never see if it's a second time
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have to call me if you want me
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
to come in I can set a bail on this
 
01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
person it's your option but you don't
 
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
and the police know it at least my
 
01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
police know they can go so there's
 
01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
something very um how can I deny their
 
01:41:42.189 --> 01:41:42.199 align:start position:0%
experience but there's something IL
 
01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
defined ill administered here because
 
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
they should be before a judge and maybe
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
the judge is the revolving door I don't
 
01:41:54.189 --> 01:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
know but I see this as an elaborate
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
Machinery that's unnecessary and that's
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
where I am thank you um to be clear the
 
01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
statute allows for people to be released
 
01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
um innumerable times on on personal
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
recognizance well I would well almost I
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't put it that way uh the the the
 
01:42:16.669 --> 01:42:16.679 align:start position:0%
statute that's in place now RSA
 
01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
5972 Roman numeral 3C reads like this
 
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
if there is probable cause to believe
 
01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
it's entitled failure of a person to
 
01:42:27.950 --> 01:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
abide by previous bail conditions
 
01:42:30.669 --> 01:42:30.679 align:start position:0%
getting arrested again is that failure
 
01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
if there is probable cause to believe
 
01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
that while on release pending resolution
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
of a previous offense the person
 
01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
committed a felony a Class A misdemeanor
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
or driving or operating while impaired
 
01:42:45.589 --> 01:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
there shall be a rebuttable presumption
 
01:42:47.629 --> 01:42:47.639 align:start position:0%
that the person will not abide by a
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
condition that the person not commit a
 
01:42:51.790 --> 01:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
new offense uh the court shall not
 
01:42:53.470 --> 01:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
impose a financial condition that will
 
01:42:55.589 --> 01:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
result in the pre-trial Detention of the
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
person so as a result of that Financial
 
01:43:00.990 --> 01:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
condition unless the court determines by
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence after a
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
hearing that no reasonable alternative
 
01:43:09.070 --> 01:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
or combination of conditions will assure
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
that the person will not commit a new
 
01:43:13.709 --> 01:43:13.719 align:start position:0%
offense so therein I think is the
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
problem well not the problem but what
 
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
the Gap we're talking about is that that
 
01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
all contemplates once you get to the
 
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
judge that does not contemplate what the
 
01:43:24.149 --> 01:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner should do it says the
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
court shall assume well my understanding
 
01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
of the bail commissioner statute it
 
01:43:32.430 --> 01:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
gives the bail commissioner all the
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
authority a judge has in terms of
 
01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
setting bail so this applies to a bail
 
01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner now in terms of improvement
 
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
you know uh then uh it uh instead of
 
01:43:49.629 --> 01:43:49.639 align:start position:0%
saying the court shall not impose and
 
01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
and talking about the court the court or
 
01:43:53.229 --> 01:43:53.239 align:start position:0%
bail you know it could be more explicit
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
the court or bail commissioner if we add
 
01:43:57.629 --> 01:43:57.639 align:start position:0%
magistrates to this the court or bail
 
01:43:59.870 --> 01:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner or magistrate that would
 
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
make it more clear uh and I think that's
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
part of the issue with some bail
 
01:44:07.229 --> 01:44:07.239 align:start position:0%
Commissioners in terms of training I
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a full appreciation
 
01:44:13.870 --> 01:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
of the scope of their powers um and
 
01:44:16.629 --> 01:44:16.639 align:start position:0%
that's a a training issue I think that
 
01:44:18.589 --> 01:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
this committee has talked about yeah
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay okay um that
 
01:44:24.910 --> 01:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
concludes discussion um at this point I
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
would ask for a um for a non-binding
 
01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
just is just a vote to send this
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
language over to OS um everyone in favor
 
01:44:37.470 --> 01:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
of the following if someone is arrested
 
01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
while on bail the first time they have
 
01:44:40.990 --> 01:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
an option to wear uh electronic
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
monitoring or they are held on the
 
01:44:45.229 --> 01:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
second time they are arrested while on
 
01:44:48.510 --> 01:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
bail they are held um to see the judge
 
01:44:50.109 --> 01:44:50.119 align:start position:0%
is could I see a hands of everyone in
 
01:44:53.709 --> 01:44:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:57.950 --> 01:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
please with with the exception of
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
possibly homeless
 
01:45:05.310 --> 01:45:05.320 align:start position:0%
people on certain properties thank thank
 
01:45:11.229 --> 01:45:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
right what I feel like d weigi that was
 
01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
it seems like we talked awful lot about
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
yes sir one of the things I thought did
 
01:45:25.709 --> 01:45:25.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:28.870 --> 01:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
what that one of the options also would
 
01:45:33.550 --> 01:45:33.560 align:start position:0%
be releasing someone under PR bail um
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
with the pre-trial Intervention Program
 
01:45:38.430 --> 01:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
being required as a baill uh as a
 
01:45:40.030 --> 01:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
condition of Bill we talked about it but
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
there was no pre-trial Intervention
 
01:45:44.229 --> 01:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
Program available that's if Bill if
 
01:45:46.510 --> 01:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
Avail where they are available
 
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
or um I don't believe that we discussed
 
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
it yeah it would be the funding of that
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
um go ahead representative I definitely
 
01:45:55.390 --> 01:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
think that would money the waters and
 
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to accomplish here you
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
can't really mandate something that
 
01:46:00.030 --> 01:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist in a particular County and
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
we don't know exactly what services they
 
01:46:03.589 --> 01:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
have I think that would be something
 
01:46:05.550 --> 01:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
properly addressed in the in the
 
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
commission when they form the Statewide
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
I don't see how how um we could well if
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
you if you have a county you know like
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
Treasure County where they actually do
 
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
have you know pretty involved um pre-out
 
01:46:20.830 --> 01:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
programs that are available I mean one
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
of the ways we could write it is just
 
01:46:25.470 --> 01:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
say if if available so it would be an
 
01:46:28.270 --> 01:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
option if the programs are available if
 
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
they are not available it wouldn't be an
 
01:46:32.830 --> 01:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
option what would be the yeah but I
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm asking is what would be
 
01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
the you'd have to be much more narrow
 
01:46:38.430 --> 01:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
okay pre-trial Services what will they
 
01:46:41.070 --> 01:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
contain what what this is in the
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
situation you know again of um I know
 
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
we're kind of combining things but the
 
01:46:48.750 --> 01:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
again a nuisance arrest so you've got
 
01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:51.719 align:start position:0%
somebody who has an obvious problem you
 
01:46:55.470 --> 01:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
know whether it's um it's uh it's drug
 
01:46:58.390 --> 01:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
addition addiction mental health issues
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
um chronic
 
01:47:03.310 --> 01:47:03.320 align:start position:0%
homelessness uh and they are arrested
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
twice let's say for criminal trespassing
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
or shouting at people on the street or
 
01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that they get arrested
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
for um it would it would provide the
 
01:47:17.149 --> 01:47:17.159 align:start position:0%
option to divert them to some type of a
 
01:47:19.950 --> 01:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
program if I would agree that the that
 
01:47:22.990 --> 01:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
the Court we can say that the court has
 
01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
the option but I want them to see the
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
judge so if if the judge says okay you
 
01:47:31.149 --> 01:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
may be released um if you go to
 
01:47:31.159 --> 01:47:32.910 align:start position:0%
may be released um if you go to
pre-trial

01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
pre-trial
 
01:47:35.709 --> 01:47:35.719 align:start position:0%
services that that would be fine but to
 
01:47:37.229 --> 01:47:37.239 align:start position:0%
put that on the baill commissioner say
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
okay you have to hook up with free-
 
01:47:42.510 --> 01:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
trial Services somehow um it's just it
 
01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's there's too many moving parts that
 
01:47:46.350 --> 01:47:46.360 align:start position:0%
I can think of that how we would ensure
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
that representative Stone yeah just a
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
followup if the individual de Clines to
 
01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
be released that individual still has to
 
01:47:56.189 --> 01:47:56.199 align:start position:0%
be seen before a judge yeah so it's not
 
01:47:58.350 --> 01:47:58.360 align:start position:0%
a long span of time I would imagine it
 
01:48:00.990 --> 01:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
be 24 hours if they're held in no one
 
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking about would be held longer
 
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
than that short period of time anyway so
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
at which point the judge could say I'm
 
01:48:07.870 --> 01:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
going to release you to pre-trial
 
01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
Services we're not mandating they the
 
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
judge hold people just the bail
 
01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner till they get to the judge
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
which can be no more than 24 hours so
 
01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
keeping that simple I think is the best
 
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
way to go instead of trying to add all
 
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
this extra language and possibly
 
01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
programs don't exist in certain areas
 
01:48:23.709 --> 01:48:23.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I I just think that it's too much
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
to happen in the short period of time
 
01:48:26.950 --> 01:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
until looking to see the judge anyway
 
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
that where the judge would actually send
 
01:48:31.950 --> 01:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
them to pre trial if it exists okay um
 
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
but we're going to continue um some of
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
the discussions as we craft the langage
 
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
to send over to OS the next time we meet
 
01:48:40.189 --> 01:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
we were going to have language on what
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
we discussed yesterday and what we
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
discussed today to have a formal vote of
 
01:48:46.229 --> 01:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
the subcomittee and we will promptly
 
01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
move into the main meet of the matter um
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
with regard to the
 
01:48:53.950 --> 01:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
um the magistrate issue we've discussed
 
01:48:55.950 --> 01:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
and the crimes that the Senate wants
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
included in how we are going to about
 
01:48:59.790 --> 01:48:59.800 align:start position:0%
addressing that so next week is going to
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
be very busy um watch we may have to add
 
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
a day I'm not sure yet I know nobody
 
01:49:06.709 --> 01:49:06.719 align:start position:0%
likes that but we're coming up on the
 
01:49:08.510 --> 01:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
deadline to get this stuff over to the
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
clerk's office so weay today I'm not
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
prepared to do any of that um but I do I
 
01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
am going to stay today just to type this
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
and send it over to LS so that's going
 
01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
to be enough okay yes sir if uh we added
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
a day would that be Wednesday do you
 
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
think I'm not sure yet um did you have a
 
01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:29.639 align:start position:0%
conflict uh not necessarily but as far
 
01:49:31.629 --> 01:49:31.639 align:start position:0%
back as we could know the day that great
 
01:49:32.750 --> 01:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
I I'm probably going to end up ending
 
01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
I'll probably be out of state on Monday
 
01:49:35.550 --> 01:49:35.560 align:start position:0%
that's I'm probably going to end adding
 
01:49:37.870 --> 01:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
a day the following week as we come into
 
01:49:39.629 --> 01:49:39.639 align:start position:0%
the final week okay rather than next
 
01:49:41.709 --> 01:49:41.719 align:start position:0%
week so U matter of fact is everyone is
 
01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
available I'm thinking about changing
 
01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
Wednesday Thursday for Wednesday next
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
week because I have another uh U
 
01:49:50.270 --> 01:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
commitment for the legislature is anyone
 
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
available next Wednesday or not
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
available next Wednesday we do have
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
another uh we have the 470 subcommittee
 
01:49:59.229 --> 01:49:59.239 align:start position:0%
meeting at 10 o'cl on Wednesday how long
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
does that usually last um that's
 
01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
probably going to go about an hour and a
 
01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
half okay so we may I may end up having
 
01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:10.040 align:start position:0%

01:50:14.189 --> 01:50:14.199 align:start position:0%
