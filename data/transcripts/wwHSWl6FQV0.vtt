00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
this isn't shaped
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
but you can go through it and shade it
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%

by holding it we had an opportunity to
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
get our questions answered
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
and the house will accede to section 23.
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%

00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%

00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
i i'd like to start out by saying
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
that i've been asked by 128
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
of our fellow house representatives to
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
um introduce this amendment um
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
what we're wanting to do is to drive
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
the financial and physical separation
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
of abortion services from the state
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
family planning money and in discussions
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
a week or two ago with senator bradley
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
it was our understanding or my
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
understanding rather
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
that the issue that the senate had
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
primarily with what we had
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
done in hb2 was that we didn't
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
do enough to ensure a graceful
 
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.150 align:start position:0%
do enough to ensure a graceful
transition

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
transition
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
between the status quo and the future
 
00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.310 align:start position:0%
between the status quo and the future
state

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
of physical and financial separation so
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
senator um this this amendment is meant
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
to address what i thought i heard um
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
that day uh if you if you have it
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
do you see that sir okay okay so lines
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh one through two or one through five
 
00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
is really just
 
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
statement of intent that we're we're
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
physical and financial separation
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
and and then lines 6 through 15
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
are the language that talks about
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
which monies would still be permitted
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
despite this
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
bill and uh and it also
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
ends by talking about the physical and
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
financial separation of reproductive
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
health facilities from
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
our fam state family planning programs
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh lines 16 and 17
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
are really there to give a graceful
 
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.589 align:start position:0%
are really there to give a graceful
closure

00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
closure
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
to contracts by saying that any contract
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's in place
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
i want to say natural life but that
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't really fit i want that it wants
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
to go to
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
its term of contract
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
lines 18 through 21 are intended to
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
create a 10
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
000 incentive um for up to
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
seven clinics to have an incentive for
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
new awardees to come in and compete um
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
so we we do want competition we we have
 
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:44.710 align:start position:0%
so we we do want competition we we have
heard

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
that in the past when these went up for
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
bid that there wasn't enough competition
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
so in order to get the competition we're
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh sweetening the pot with a ten
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar incentive
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
and then in the possibility
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
that there may not be
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
a new awardee in a particular area
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
then this bill would authorize the
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
extension for the current contract
 
00:40:12.079 --> 00:40:13.109 align:start position:0%
extension for the current contract
awarder

00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
awarder
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
awardee for up to three extensions
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
so we do not want to create
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
a lack of continuity of care and so
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
um we put all of this in effect on one
 
00:40:25.839 --> 00:40:26.710 align:start position:0%
um we put all of this in effect on one
october

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
october
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
2021 so that uh dhhs has an opportunity
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
to put rfps together
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
and go get solicitations and do some
 
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.109 align:start position:0%
and go get solicitations and do some
evaluations

00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
evaluations
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
so so so we've attempted to create a
 
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
graceful transition from where we're at
 
00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.589 align:start position:0%
graceful transition from where we're at
to

00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
where 128 house republicans are asking
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
us to go
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
so if you're watching at home the house
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
had a position
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
it is not what you just heard but it was
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
similar and the senate had a position
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
they modified the house
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
representative edwards has gone over an
 
00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:03.349 align:start position:0%
representative edwards has gone over an
expanded

00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
expanded
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
house position we thank him for that
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding senator bradley
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
that you have an amendment on this same
 
00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.470 align:start position:0%
that you have an amendment on this same
section

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
and if you are ready to discuss it at
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
this time we could have
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
lba pass that out all right thank you
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
very much madam chair it's amendment
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
1929 okay if you're at home 2021-1929-h
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
is what we're going to be looking at
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
so thank you madam chair this takes a um
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat different approach than my
 
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:42.710 align:start position:0%
somewhat different approach than my
friend

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
friend
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative edwards and i would
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
say this i appreciate the
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
um willingness to try to make sure that
 
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
reproductive health care services
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
separate from abortion
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
force can continue to be
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
provided for low-income women i think we
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
would all agree or i hope we would that
 
00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.109 align:start position:0%
would all agree or i hope we would that
that's

00:42:05.109 --> 00:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
important um to make sure that those
 
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.510 align:start position:0%
important um to make sure that those
services

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
are available to people but at the same
 
00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:12.870 align:start position:0%
are available to people but at the same
time

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
i think many of us believe
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
that there should not be public funding
 
00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:19.349 align:start position:0%
that there should not be public funding
uh

00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
for the provision of an actual abortion
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
so we build upon the language that was
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
in the senate bill
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
starting i believe it's on line seven
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
of amendment 1929 that says
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
every family planning project will
 
00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.589 align:start position:0%
every family planning project will
contain

00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
contain
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
the following provisions number one
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
no funds to subsidize abortion directly
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
or indirectly
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
two that there will be um
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
any an inspection either by the
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
department or a delegated agent to
 
00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
inspect the financial records of family
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
planning project
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
to monitor compliance with us so those
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
are things that
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
i believe are being done now so this is
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
not new and different
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
but it goes on to say that at the end of
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
each fiscal year the commissioner shall
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
certify in writing
 
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
to the governor and council that they
 
00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:21.750 align:start position:0%
to the governor and council that they
have

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
either themselves or through a
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
designated agent reviewed the
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
expenditure of funds
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
and they certify that no state funds
 
00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.349 align:start position:0%
and they certify that no state funds
awarded

00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
awarded
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
by the department could be used to
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
actually provide
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
abortion services and if the
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
for commissioner fails to make such
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
a certification
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
then the governor and council based on
 
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
that evidence
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
would find that abortion services have
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
been provided with the funds then there
 
00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
is a choice for the provider
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
they're either in breach and this is a
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
on line 18
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
in breach of the terms of the contract
 
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.589 align:start position:0%
in breach of the terms of the contract
or

00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
b they would have to suspend all
 
00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.630 align:start position:0%
b they would have to suspend all
operations

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
at that point until they were
 
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
physically and financially separate so
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
basically what it's saying is
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
if this inspection reveals there's
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
commingling of funds for the provision
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
of abortion services
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
at that point in time either
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
the grant would be suspended or the
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
physical separation would occur
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
and i think that that is a better way to
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
that um these funds are not co-mingled
 
00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
i do recall it was probably in the
 
00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.780 align:start position:0%
i do recall it was probably in the
2011

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:47.790 align:start position:0%
2011
 
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:49.510 align:start position:0%
2011
[Music]

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
budget that we had it wasn't in the
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
budget was a separate bill the same
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
discussion about the provision of these
 
00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:59.030 align:start position:0%
discussion about the provision of these
services

00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
at the time i think i received four
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
very comprehensive letters from then
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner tumpus
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
that basically were certifying at that
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
point in time that funds were not being
 
00:45:11.359 --> 00:45:12.550 align:start position:0%
point in time that funds were not being
commingled

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
commingled
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
um i hope that is still the case this is
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
one of those
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
trust but verify moments and if
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
it's not verified then the consequences
 
00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:23.109 align:start position:0%
it's not verified then the consequences
that

00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
i think you representative edwards led
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
on in the house
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
would take effect but before that the
 
00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.190 align:start position:0%
would take effect but before that the
provision

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
provision
 
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully of these services could go
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
unimpeded and a clear recognition
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
by any provider they would know that if
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
there was a co-mingling
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
at that point in time the separation
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
would occur or the program suspended
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you madam chair questions or
 
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:54.550 align:start position:0%
so thank you madam chair questions or

representative edwards has your hand up
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
i i do have a question for the senator
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
senator first thank you very much
 
00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:08.630 align:start position:0%
senator first thank you very much
for

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank thank you very much for including
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
the the term physically and financially
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
separate in your language i think that's
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
a a recognition of of what's really
 
00:46:18.319 --> 00:46:19.349 align:start position:0%
a a recognition of of what's really
important

00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i'm leading as much as
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
i'm listening to 128
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
people who are very passionate about
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
this and one of the beliefs
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
is that no audit will ever be able to
 
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.030 align:start position:0%
is that no audit will ever be able to
reveal

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
reveal
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
the extent to which the money is
 
00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:34.390 align:start position:0%
the extent to which the money is
fungible

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
fungible
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
and the money going in to help one side
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
clinic isn't it's just no way to keep
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
that money from
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
helping the other side um but i do
 
00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:46.550 align:start position:0%
helping the other side um but i do
appreciate

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
um your language in here i i just wonder
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
you come very close
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
to the word audit and and don't use the
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
word audit i'm just curious what you're
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
thinking on that yes sir
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
well i i think certainly the way that
 
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
this is written
 
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
inspect the financial records that could
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
be an audit
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
it would be at the discretion obviously
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
of whoever the commissioner was
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
but um and where it says
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
um his or her designated agent or
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
delegate again that could well be an
 
00:47:18.319 --> 00:47:20.549 align:start position:0%
delegate again that could well be an
auditor

00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
auditor
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
a follow-up thank you man i'm sure um
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
so so i i've been requested to
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
try to make sure that any audit or any
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
investigation that's done
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
is something that could be publicly
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
shared on a website do you have any
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
thoughts about that sir
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
i would believe
 
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
based on my understanding of the right
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
to know law
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
and how we work here that the department
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
would be under an obligation to reveal
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
because it would have to go to the
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
governor council the
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
um findings of whatever
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
inspection audit whatever we want to
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
call it
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
but that's my belief but i do
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
i mean i do believe that that would be
 
00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:10.950 align:start position:0%
i mean i do believe that that would be
required

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
for either a or b
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
to go into effect it has to go to the
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
governor council
 
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
so i think it would be a fully public
 
00:48:20.079 --> 00:48:20.870 align:start position:0%
so i think it would be a fully public
process

00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
aren't those documents to the governor
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
and council now available online
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
for every meeting i believe they are i
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
believe that's the case
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
that's what i thought that's all of my
 
00:48:32.559 --> 00:48:32.950 align:start position:0%
that's what i thought that's all of my
questions

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
senator bradley moves amendment
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
2021-1929-s and i think
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald is your hand up to
 
00:48:46.839 --> 00:48:51.510 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald is your hand up to
second

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
okay let me see if i can get a second
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
senator morris
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:00.839 --> 00:49:02.630 align:start position:0%
 
recognized

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
one is that state funds
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
are not used to take proportions
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
and that means that the patient
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
so generally i think as a legislature
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
we believe that the legislature should
 
00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:25.109 align:start position:0%
we believe that the legislature should
not

00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
meddle in the affairs of private
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
organizations so i'm wondering
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
because that looks like a departure from
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
that but i
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
also questioned
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
the language online where he
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if there are other
 
00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:50.549 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if there are other
examples

00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
examples
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
of the state telling medical providers
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
to suspend their operations when their
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
license and their scope of practice
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
allows them to
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
deliver that care of that people
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
sandra bradley can you answer those well
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
i'll do my best i mean i think that this
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
language is consistent with the hyde
 
00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:15.589 align:start position:0%
language is consistent with the hyde
amendment

00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
which has long been the law of the land
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
for federal funding
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
that there should not be public dollars
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
federally used for the provision of
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
abortion services so i would agree with
 
00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:31.589 align:start position:0%
abortion services so i would agree with
my

00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
normally i don't think government gets
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
in between
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
these services but we do have a federal
 
00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:43.430 align:start position:0%
these services but we do have a federal
law

00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
we have long had a state prohibition
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's usually been
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
re-upped in every succeeding trailer
 
00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:51.510 align:start position:0%
re-upped in every succeeding trailer
bill

00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
of one kind or another that prohibits
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
and that's consistent with
 
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
the hyde amendment so
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
while it it would not be
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
treated the same as say a cancer
 
00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:12.790 align:start position:0%
treated the same as say a cancer
screening

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
screening
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
um or treatment or something like that i
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
agree with you
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
but we have a in this country
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
under the hyde amendment and you know
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's adoption of the hyde
 
00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:25.030 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's adoption of the hyde
amendment

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
um specific prohibitions on
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
the use of public funding for abortion
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
so i think that it's
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
um while it's a different category it's
 
00:51:35.359 --> 00:51:35.990 align:start position:0%
um while it's a different category it's
appropriate

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
because you have these family planning
 
00:51:38.319 --> 00:51:39.270 align:start position:0%
because you have these family planning
dollars

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
that have that prohibition on it both in
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
federal and
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up representative
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
rosenwald thank you i'm sorry senator
 
00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:51.910 align:start position:0%
rosenwald thank you i'm sorry senator
roosevelt

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
roosevelt
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
cindy and i served together on house
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
finance and i know
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
she's moved on to the senate and
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes my brain knows that sometimes
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
that's okay i was just wondering if you
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
could respond to my second question
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
i think i could repeat it yes so you
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
said that
 
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
b would direct um
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
the private medical providers to suspend
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
all operations and i'm wondering
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
what other examples the state has done
 
00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:23.750 align:start position:0%
what other examples the state has done
that

00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
when they're practicing medical care
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
within their license and their scope of
 
00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.750 align:start position:0%
within their license and their scope of
practice

00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
well i think i just gave a
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
probably a rather long explanation of
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
the hyde amendment
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire's efforts so obviously
 
00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:42.790 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire's efforts so obviously
um

00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
if there is a prohibition on
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
use of these funds for abortion
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
the provision of abortion this
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
if somebody violated that law this is a
 
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
penalty for violating
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
that law in fact it's just following
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
funds forward
 
00:53:07.349 --> 00:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
so you'd be expanding
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
the cease and desist beyond
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
stop providing abortions with state
 
00:53:13.839 --> 00:53:14.470 align:start position:0%
stop providing abortions with state
money

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
which they don't do to suspend
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
all operations cancer screenings
 
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
pap smears breast exams
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh routine primary care you would be
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
telling a licensed medical provider to
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
stop practicing medicine if they were
 
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.829 align:start position:0%
stop practicing medicine if they were
utilizing

00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
utilizing
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
yes if they were utilizing
 
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
the dollars that are in the family
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
planning contract for the provision of
 
00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.470 align:start position:0%
planning contract for the provision of
abortion

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
which they're not supposed to do and i
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
would agree with you
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it happens in new
 
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire so this is
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
as much as anything an insurance policy
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
to ensure that it doesn't happen
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
i agree i don't believe it is happening
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
the research that i did in 2011 now
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
that was 10 years ago but i think it's
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
still the same that being said
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
there are a number of questions that
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
people raise
 
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
and if there was a violation of that
 
00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:21.750 align:start position:0%
and if there was a violation of that
then

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
um there has to be some consequence and
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's what
 
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
um this calls for as opposed to
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
the house language that would require
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
the separation immediately
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
and and that could lead as we found
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
um several years ago when i think
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
governor sununu put out
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
the family contracts for bid and there
 
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
were no bidders
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
um that would lead to a an immediate
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
cessation of those services which
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
you and i would not want i think
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
representative edwards has a question
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair i i just uh for
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
people who are watching this i i just
 
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:02.710 align:start position:0%
people who are watching this i i just
think

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
something's really important to keep in
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
mind that we're talking about
 
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
state money that's going to family
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
planning services
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
and the house has shown strong support
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
for the family planning program
 
00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
three years ago the funding level was at
 
00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.549 align:start position:0%
three years ago the funding level was at
596

00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
596
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
000 we've raised it 10 percent each year
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
to this year where we've accepted the
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal of 812
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
000 so so we are fully in support
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
of having a very strong family planning
 
00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:35.589 align:start position:0%
of having a very strong family planning
program

00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's well resourced and is protected
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
so that it's
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
continuous and it can provide service to
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
everyone who needs it regardless of
 
00:55:44.079 --> 00:55:44.870 align:start position:0%
everyone who needs it regardless of
income

00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
so so there is absolutely no dispute
 
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
all all we're trying to do is to make
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
sure that when people go into a family
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
planning clinic
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
that they're going in there to plan a
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
family and not to be seeking an abortion
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
or to have the hidden indicators of
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
the clinic or the room across the
 
00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:07.190 align:start position:0%
the clinic or the room across the
hallway

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
hallway
 
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
being used to provide those abortions
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
just trying to keep
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
family planning separate from
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
the constitutionally protected right
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
women have to an abortion but just keep
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald thank you i would just
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
comment that i think this amendment goes
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
way beyond that
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
by allowing the state to
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
essentially hold health care
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
hostage for up to 15 000 people
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
if by some
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
stroke of lba's pen or whoever's doing
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
the audit
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
some state funds were
 
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
shown to be going to an abortion
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
which doesn't happen that would suspend
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
possibly all operations
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
including things that are not abortion
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
related and i fear
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
that some patients
 
00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
might develop cancer and that would be
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
on us
 
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
i am not i can't go there but thank you
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.839 --> 00:57:26.710 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
judging from some of the correspondence
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
we've had saying
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
don't stop abortions don't prevent me
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
from getting an abortion
 
00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
we are here doing a budget we are
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
determining how
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
federal house how state monies get spent
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
how the taxpayers monies get spent
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's our responsibility
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
and this state has decided they do not
 
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
want to spend money for abortions
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
we're not stopping abortions we're just
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
stopping funding of them i want to make
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
that point
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
very clear thank you representative
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
weiler okay on the motion to adopt
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
amendment 2021-1929-s
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
if the house is in favor of adoption
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
senator morse science
 
00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:21.040 align:start position:0%

00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
with one senator opposed
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%

00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
nice of you
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
this point of order man uh what do we do
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%

00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
you for the clarification
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
i would like to say that we propose to
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
make it a house bill next year
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
the next section we have not agreed on
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
is found on page 51 and it was actually
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
a house section that
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
the senate did not move on it was at the
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
house section 58
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
however yesterday we agreed with the
 
00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.589 align:start position:0%
however yesterday we agreed with the
senate

00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
on language that would not only resolve
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
this problem for doc
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
but for every agency so the house is in
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
total agreement of
 
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
getting rid of this section mr cain
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
and i think we were just on the topic of
 
00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:18.470 align:start position:0%
and i think we were just on the topic of
audits

00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
audits
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
don't i have an amendment for an audit
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
a fund in das sure we have
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
an amendment for a comprehensive review
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
of the medical trust
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
subsidy which we can hand out if you'd
 
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.839 --> 00:59:46.069 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
this is amendment 2021-1967-h
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
it actually relates to work we did
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday on sections 14 and 15
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
that we either agreed with and or
 
01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:25.910 align:start position:0%
that we either agreed with and or
amended

01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
amended
 
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
and this will have the office of the
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant conducting
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive review
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
of the medical insurance subsidy trust
 
01:00:34.079 --> 01:00:34.789 align:start position:0%
of the medical insurance subsidy trust
account

01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to the
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
transfer funds to and from the new
 
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire retirement system
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
and the state and other former employees
 
01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
rate setting trust account record
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
keeping and reporting
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
this is in compliance with state and
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
federal legislation and
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
other relevant factors as determined by
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
the lba
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
the reason we have that is that we have
 
01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:57.270 align:start position:0%
the reason we have that is that we have
two

01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
sections concerning this medical
 
01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
insurance subsidy trust
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
that while we're working on it we also
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
think it is time to have a complete stop
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
and do a review and make sure that
 
01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
everybody is being protected we are
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
senator bradley uh question so will this
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
replace section 14 and 15.
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
no sir it is in addition we agreed with
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
14 in the amendment yesterday so this is

of highlights i think
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
yesterday the house intended
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
on page 98 to agree
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
that we were no longer needed house
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
section 141 i'm afraid i wasn't very
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
clear on that
 
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
the reason we agreed to that is that
 
01:02:18.789 --> 01:02:18.799 align:start position:0%
money has been paid by arpa funds
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%

01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%

something that relates to this
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh yes but that was funded in hb1
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
yes but it's relative to that to give
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
them time to get where they need to be
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%

questions
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
senator bradley so this was a request of
 
01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
doj and
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%

the house this way
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
that because there was a new program in
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%

01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
they should have time to work on it come
 
01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.270 align:start position:0%
they should have time to work on it come
together

01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%

01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
early not giving them time to make that
 
01:05:18.079 --> 01:05:18.630 align:start position:0%

or is this something that we normally
would

01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
move that lba does technical and
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%

01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
what is the best way to proceed with
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
this section so
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
for on page 137 of the side by side
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
senate section 193 you remember the
 
01:06:36.799 --> 01:06:37.829 align:start position:0%
senate section 193 you remember the
discussion

01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh the department of energy whereas the
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner appointing the commissioner
 
01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:41.750 align:start position:0%
commissioner appointing the commissioner
yes

01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
so the committee made a motion to remove
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh the establishment of that
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner position is necessary in
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
statute so we do need an amendment which
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
we can hand out
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
in addition we do outline we use the
 
01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
governor's language fulfilling those
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
positions which is actually outlined in
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
the department of energy amendment so
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
some positions are appointed by governor
 
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
and council
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
some are purely by commissioner but we
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
make a reference to that
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
so if we can hand that amendment out
 
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
relative to that please do it will you
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
also make sure the governor's budget
 
01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119 align:start position:0%

01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
however with that appointment that
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
committee now had an even number
 
01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
and the house was afraid with a
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
committee with an even number
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
would consistently vote eight to eight
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
with no way to
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
break the tie so we had made one minor
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
change in order to
 
01:09:17.349 --> 01:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
accommodate the adding the addition of
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the department of
 
01:09:18.799 --> 01:09:19.590 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the department of
energy

01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
i think the governor and his staff and
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
man i'm going to ask you
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
for sure but i believe the decision was
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
to leave the site evaluation committee
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
as it was without the addition of the
 
01:09:31.759 --> 01:09:32.550 align:start position:0%
as it was without the addition of the
department

01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
of commission commissioner of department
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
of energy on it
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
is that correct ma'am that's correct and
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
the thinking there was osi did not
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
sit on that committee there was no need
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
for the department
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
of energy's commissioners so the house
 
01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
is succeeding to
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.950 align:start position:0%
 
228

01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
228
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
the house had no comparable section
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm again going to ask matt now that
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
he's here
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
we held on to that i assume this is
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
something that came up after this pass
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
the house because i know everybody was
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
working on this
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
correct we think there are a lot of
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
conversations that are worth
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
while having on the site evaluation
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
committee those are best done outside
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
at the request of uh leadership
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
of science technology and energy this
 
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
commission has a very aggressive
 
01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.510 align:start position:0%
commission has a very aggressive
deadline

01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
i believe with their recommendations due
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
october 1st of this year
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
so certainly in the intent is to clean
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
up the site evaluation committee with
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
any necessary changes
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the next session thank you the house
 
01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
will exceed to the senate position
 
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
mr kane on page 168 section 240 do we
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
we do there was an amendment handed out
 
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
by representative ober and then senator
 
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
bradley had us drafted an amendment
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
which we'll hand out now
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
which addresses that i hope
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:37.430 align:start position:0%
 
2021-1951s

01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
2021-1951s
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
um line one talks about
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing special fund sorry line
 
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.189 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing special fund sorry line
three

01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
line four says it will be continually
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
appropriated to the commission to be
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
expended in accordance with this section
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
provided that at the start of the period
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
in which there is no adopted state
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
operating budget which we hope happens
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
very rarely
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
the commission shall in a timely manner
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
seek the approval of the fiscal
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
committee of the general court
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
to continue using monies from the
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
to support renewable energy rebate and
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
grant programs
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure that there are no
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
interruptions in the programs
 
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
i'm good senator bradley moves amendment
 
01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.350 align:start position:0%
i'm good senator bradley moves amendment
2021-1951

01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
2021-1951
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
s represent wyler's seconds
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
the house is in favor please raise your
 
01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:27.750 align:start position:0%
the house is in favor please raise your
hand

01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
all righty
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
all right and i think there's another
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
one we kind of held till matt came back
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
matt's so glad he came back matt we're
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
on page 177
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
um the house
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
senate section 251 the house did not
 
01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
have the repeal
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
of rsa 374-f cohen four
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
could you just talk to us a little bit
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
about that sure so
 
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
roman one in house section 242
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
was determined that it should stay so
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
there's no repeal there's no
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
reenactment that lie will just stay on
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
the books
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
roman 2 in house section 242
 
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
is the same as what you see in roman 1
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
and section
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
251 of the senate version roman 2 in the
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
senate version
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
is new and i would say there's plenty of
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
other statutes
 
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
in the energy law that could be cleaned
 
01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
up in a subsequent bill next section
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
our next session this was a one-time
 
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
requirement from 1997
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
for restructuring to have the utilities
 
01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:49.110 align:start position:0%
for restructuring to have the utilities
file

01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
file
 
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
a single report one time that's still on
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
the books today and it made sense to
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
clean it up here
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
okay in that case the house is going to
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to turn to page 199.
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
i think we needed some details on this
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
but i can't remember exactly where we
 
01:14:18.719 --> 01:14:19.669 align:start position:0%
but i can't remember exactly where we
were

01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
we are looking at section 272
 
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
we would like some details the house had
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
no comparable section here
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
sure this is another area of the law
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
that is from
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
the way the energy sector worked prior
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
to restructuring
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
i believe these lots have been in the
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
book since the 50s and have not been
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
used since that time
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
and in the restructured wholesale market
 
01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:01.270 align:start position:0%
and in the restructured wholesale market
that

01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire operates under iceland new
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
england there's no real
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
mechanism for these sections of law to
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
become operable
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
and given that they haven't been used in
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
my lifetime
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
much less other people's lifetimes again
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
made sense to clean that up here
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
okay we're okay with that right
 
01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
all right the house succeeds to the
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
we are on page 230
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
the house had asked to retain
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
the single sales factor
 
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
of the business profits tax chairman
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
major of the house ways and means
 
01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.229 align:start position:0%
major of the house ways and means
committee

01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to do some research into that
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
he has done that and i think i'm
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
repeating this correctly
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
represent major the house will now
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
accede to the senate's position and
 
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.149 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
welcome and that is
 
01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
i think my
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
sections to a page
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
230 and again 234 there's a committee
 
01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
that we don't need
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
because we're not doing this yes to page
 
01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
236 has enactment of the single sales
 
01:16:28.159 --> 01:16:29.189 align:start position:0%
236 has enactment of the single sales
factor

01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
factor
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
and page 236 has a repeal of a
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
legislative committee
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
so all of those are included in that
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's correct sections 287 and 290
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
okay on
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
which is the page 243 and the compare
 
01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.149 align:start position:0%
which is the page 243 and the compare
report

01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
and these were house sections 303
 
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
this relates to a bill
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
that has been retained in the house
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
and the house position is we will agree
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
to remove these from hb2 and in the fall
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
we will work on our retained bill
 
01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
so we are can mike
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
mark all of those off yes section 303
 
01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:34.550 align:start position:0%
mark all of those off yes section 303
through

01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
section 321.9 we'll put as uh
 
01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
senate seating sorry how succeeding to
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
the senate yes
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to skip to page 11 i
 
01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.390 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to skip to page 11 i
think

01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
nope we didn't have any disagreement
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
there we're going to go to
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
page 12.
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
this is the sununu youth center
 
01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
i think we have an amendment and i
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
believe we would like to have a
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
discussion with the senate i'm not sure
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
if you've seen the amendment i know i
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative turkan would you yield to
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%

and can we have the amendment passed out
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment is uh currently at ols
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
being redrafted so it's not available at
 
01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
this time oops
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
okay we are currently going to hold on
 
01:18:28.159 --> 01:18:28.870 align:start position:0%
okay we are currently going to hold on
that

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
until we have the amendment so we will
 
01:18:32.229 --> 01:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
move on but why
 
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
represent edwards is here if i could
 
01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
just point out on page 273
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
senate section 325 was on hold and that
 
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
has to do with child care services
 
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
okay let's do that one thank you mike
 
01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
jeff sorry i didn't know that amendment
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to turn to page 273 if
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
you're chugging along with us at home
 
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at senate pass section
 
01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:58.630 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at senate pass section
325

01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
325
 
01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
representative edwards would you like to
 
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
this is department of health yes ma'am
 
01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
no i i know i'm just uh
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
trying to get my my eyes and thinking uh
 
01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:13.110 align:start position:0%
trying to get my my eyes and thinking uh
aligned

01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
aligned
 
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
child care services i was trying to talk
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
no i gotta
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
fill the dead air so um
 
01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
we believe that this would have been
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
better going through a policy committee
 
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:24.550 align:start position:0%
better going through a policy committee
than

01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
they come into the finance committee
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
directly in the hb2 process
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
but um as it stands uh
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
we are willing to proceed to the senate
 
01:19:36.159 --> 01:19:39.510 align:start position:0%
we are willing to proceed to the senate
position

01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:44.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
the house will exceed to the senate
 
01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.750 align:start position:0%
the house will exceed to the senate
position

01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
and we still don't have the sununu
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
center because so we will
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
move on i'm sorry can i have a
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
a second shot at this i i had my book
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
upside down
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
and i read the wrong thing we are not
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
exceeding to this
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
to the center position we're having a
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
second shot try to
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so much the book is written
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
where you have to go back and forth and
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
i just made a mistake i apologize
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
the book did not for people who are at
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
home or
 
01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
in the audience the book did not get
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
printed so like a page where you turn it
 
01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
up and you read the next one
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
so you have to pick up your book and you
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
have to switch it because the print's
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
upside down
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
said remorse i think we informed advent
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
services we're not paying for the books
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
so but we're getting so much exercise
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
out of it it's good for our weight
 
01:20:43.199 --> 01:20:44.470 align:start position:0%
out of it it's good for our weight
program

01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
all right so so the essence of the
 
01:20:52.629 --> 01:20:52.639 align:start position:0%
of the senate position in um section 357
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
is that they uh show a preference for
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
we're on section 325
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
i am on that number it is 325. thank you
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh and it's um a preference for
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
attendance-based payment
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
for child care is that right
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
good uh so um the the current
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
the status quo now is that uh payments
 
01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:19.270 align:start position:0%
the status quo now is that uh payments
are

01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
are made on uh on an attendance basis
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
um and not an enrollment basis
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
and so rather than moving to an
 
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
enrollment basis in hb2
 
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
we'd like to put this into a house bill
 
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
and have the policy committee look at it
 
01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:37.030 align:start position:0%
and have the policy committee look at it
next

01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
year in talking with the department
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
this morning and last night they would
 
01:21:43.679 --> 01:21:44.070 align:start position:0%
this morning and last night they would
need

01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
time to make plans to
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
to support a policy shift from
 
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:50.870 align:start position:0%
to support a policy shift from
attendance

01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
to enrollment they would need new rules
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
and procedures
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
they would have some issues with their
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
i.t system only being able to access one
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
source of funds and
 
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
not multiple for different things so
 
01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:04.950 align:start position:0%
not multiple for different things so
what

01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
what i have agreed to with the
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
department is that i would recommend
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
that we take this section
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
roll it into a house bill let a policy
 
01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
committee look at it
 
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
um the the it reprogramming alone could
 
01:22:18.639 --> 01:22:19.270 align:start position:0%
um the the it reprogramming alone could
take

01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
many many months so so that's that's
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
what i would
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
ask us to do so it is your position
 
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
if i could to leave this on hold we do
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
not have an amendment to delete this
 
01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
section we would just leave it on hold
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
and it would be addressed in the bill is
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
that where we are
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
comments senator bradley so would it be
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
possible to ask representative walner a
 
01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:47.669 align:start position:0%
possible to ask representative walner a
question

01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely um
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative walner and i
 
01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
had a um
 
01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
brief conversation in the hall before we
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
got here i just wanted to confirm that
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
you are in support
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
of representative edward's position that
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
this would be better deleted from hb2
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
we can hear you but nobody else can hear
 
01:23:24.239 --> 01:23:27.830 align:start position:0%
we can hear you but nobody else can hear
you

01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um there are a couple of
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
things about this that concern me
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
about um the way the enrollment based
 
01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:50.149 align:start position:0%
about um the way the enrollment based
amen

01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
amen
 
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
part of the amendment is written and the
 
01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.510 align:start position:0%
part of the amendment is written and the
one

01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
most concerning is that we can use no
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
state general funds
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that will be very
 
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
problematic for the department
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
and for child care providers because the
 
01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:05.910 align:start position:0%
and for child care providers because the
reason

01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
there are general funds in the state
 
01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:10.310 align:start position:0%
there are general funds in the state
budget

01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
are for the payment to providers for the
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
provision of child care
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
so if we're no longer able to use those
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
we will not spend down our general funds
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that will
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
um be problematic for us present in the
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
next year
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
but also into the future
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
and so if i could please so you're in
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
agreement with representative edwards
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
that this needs a
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
separate bill that goes through the
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
policy committees in both the house and
 
01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
senate next year
 
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
yes and i think that the senate may
 
01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:42.629 align:start position:0%
yes and i think that the senate may
actually

01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
have an enrollment-based bill
 
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
in your we do that we re-referred that
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
you re-referred
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
so there is already a bill that could be
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
um used in january
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
you're correct in that thank you senator
 
01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:01.189 align:start position:0%
you're correct in that thank you senator
rosenwald

01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
rosenwald
 
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
oops i'm sorry senator bradley follow up
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
could i ask
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
a question of representatives you could
 
01:25:07.199 --> 01:25:07.830 align:start position:0%
a question of representatives you could
okay

01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
i just want to be clear you're not
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
recommending we take the house
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
version out just the
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
senate's edition just
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
the senate edition the house the house
 
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
piece was
 
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
in there in both the house and the
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
senate um
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
i'm just suggesting that we take out the
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
um what the senate added
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
thank you could we identify those
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
because we need to yeah sure on page
 
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
274 uh you'll see highlighted
 
01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
at the top of the page where it begins
 
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
the department shall provide
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
enrollment based reimbursement uh rep
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative wallner is stating
 
01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
that um not to agree with that language
 
01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
so it would be basically
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
the senator seating to the house if the
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
senate agrees
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
okay the senate will see to the house's
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
position on this section and
 
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
we will still have it marked as done
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to hold on let's see
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
all right yesterday we had held page 315
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
section 384
 
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
section because representative umberger
 
01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk to senator
 
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
hennessey who had originated this
 
01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.030 align:start position:0%
hennessey who had originated this
language

01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:26:59.830 --> 01:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative omburger where are we
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
now i am fine with this uh
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
amendment the senate amendment so i
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
would recommend that we a seat
 
01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
okay so the house will accede to the
 
01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:14.229 align:start position:0%
okay so the house will accede to the
senate

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
on section 384 on page 3
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
15. if the house members are in favor
 
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
oh well we don't have to do that we're
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
just that wasn't emotion we exceed
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
we're done duh there just
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
isn't enough wine to keep my brain going
 
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
all right representative edwards
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
on page 319 we had held
 
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
i think at your request
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:31.510 align:start position:0%
 
when

01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you madam chair i apologize for
 
01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
the delay there
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
but uh we're on page 319 and it runs on
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
to 320
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
sections 399 and 400 on the senate
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
and um essentially um
 
01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
what the senate is requesting is um
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
a report with some very specific
 
01:28:58.060 --> 01:28:58.070 align:start position:0%
things in it related to
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:59.669 align:start position:0%
things in it related to
[Music]

01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
child behavioral health and
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
while i think we can accede to this i
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
just want to point out
 
01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
that there's some risk that this report
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
will be a little bit redundant with what
 
01:29:13.199 --> 01:29:13.590 align:start position:0%
will be a little bit redundant with what
is

01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
being done by the state health
 
01:29:17.110 --> 01:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
assessment commission
 
01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
and their publication of a state health
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
improvement or implementation plan
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
there could be a little redundancy i
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully the commissioners
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
will coordinate so that we don't have
 
01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
two conflicting reports
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
and then the other item is uh item eight
 
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
i'd want to point out where it deals
 
01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:37.110 align:start position:0%
i'd want to point out where it deals
with

01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
plans to develop and or coordinate a
 
01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:40.629 align:start position:0%
plans to develop and or coordinate a
cross

01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0%
cross
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
system assessment tool and it goes on
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
from there
 
01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
um i uh am concerned that we're
 
01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
reaching out to a population that's
 
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
beyond the medicaid population
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
to the general population and that we're
 
01:29:56.239 --> 01:29:57.510 align:start position:0%
to the general population and that we're
collecting

01:29:57.510 --> 01:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of data and i'm concerned that
 
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.669 align:start position:0%
a lot of data and i'm concerned that
dhhs

01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
01:30:03.970 --> 01:30:03.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the necessary
 
01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:05.669 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the necessary
[Music]

01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719 align:start position:0%
privacy and security protections uh in
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
place to be
 
01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh bringing in all this data and doing
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
the analysis so
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
so i will just say that as a long-term
 
01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:16.790 align:start position:0%
so i will just say that as a long-term
concern

01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
but other than that i i do believe the
 
01:30:19.679 --> 01:30:20.149 align:start position:0%
but other than that i i do believe the
house

01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
all right so we will the house will
 
01:30:28.750 --> 01:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
accede to sections
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
399 and 400
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:42.430 --> 01:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
and just that brings us to sections
 
01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:46.719 align:start position:0%
401 and 402
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
on page 321 which
 
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
we can accede to this system of care has
 
01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:01.830 align:start position:0%
we can accede to this system of care has
been

01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
under a great deal of discussion and for
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
years i think senator bradley has been
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
pivotal in all that so i i believe we
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
can see
 
01:31:13.030 --> 01:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
the house will exceed to the senate
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
on sections 401 and 402
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday we held 403
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
and 404 there were a couple of sections
 
01:31:28.629 --> 01:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
that mr ripple looked at for us we had
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
a couple of concerns we have an hb1
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
limited hhs to a maximum of 3 000
 
01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:38.709 align:start position:0%
limited hhs to a maximum of 3 000
employees

01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
and i've forgotten the other section mr
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
ripple you will remember why we wanted
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
to do that and you researched it can you
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
tell us where we are
 
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh yes there was also another section in
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 2
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
that related to uh abolishing positions
 
01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
that had been vacant since
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
july 1 2018 so that would not apply in
 
01:31:57.669 --> 01:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
this case
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
okay so we know that in these two
 
01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:01.830 align:start position:0%
okay so we know that in these two
sections

01:32:01.830 --> 01:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
sections
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
the abolishment does not apply and the
 
01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:05.590 align:start position:0%
the abolishment does not apply and the
limit

01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
limit
 
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
that represent edwards and his team put
 
01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:09.990 align:start position:0%
that represent edwards and his team put
in

01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
does apply so are we at this point mr
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative edwards ready to
 
01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
accede to the senate
 
01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh yes madam chair uh this is very
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
similar to
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
a section that we dealt with earlier
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
dealing with the cp
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
ws positions and so both this and the
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
contracting sections are
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
fine because they uh have to be managed
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
return the page we're on page 14. we're
 
01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:50.870 align:start position:0%
on page
323

01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
323
 
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
section 408 and it doesn't matter what
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
way i want to go my book's always upside
 
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
down in the wrong
 
01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:01.430 align:start position:0%
down in the wrong
way

01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
which even when i turn the page it's
 
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
upside down
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
i could but my notes are in here i just
 
01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
want to thank lba for my new book
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much i have a new
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
book as well but my notes are in the
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
old book which i didn't have time to
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
transfer to the new book
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
so all right we are
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
at section 408 section 408 is a
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
prospective repeal regarding eligibility
 
01:33:34.830 --> 01:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
for services
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
extended representative edwards we held
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
this at your request
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am when division 3 saw this
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
it seemed like a ongoing issue where it
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
was just in every budget cycle so we
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
deleted it what we have since found
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
out is that 10 years ago this
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
allowed our child care providers
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and start to maintain wait
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
lists if we didn't have this section in
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
there that would have technically been
 
01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
an illegal act
 
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
and so we have continued to put this in
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
every two years to
 
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
protect them and allow them to keep such
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
a list so
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
at this point we should accept this
 
01:34:16.239 --> 01:34:16.950 align:start position:0%
at this point we should accept this
language

01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
and i would like us to do a simple bill
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
in january just so we don't have to do
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
this every budget cycle
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
all right the house will exceed to the
 
01:34:25.199 --> 01:34:27.590 align:start position:0%
all right the house will exceed to the
senate

01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
and maybe in the future we won't be
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
we have three sections on hold
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
starts on page 328 sections 427 to 429
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
and this looks like a fairly simple
 
01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:48.550 align:start position:0%
and this looks like a fairly simple
situation

01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
and we're gonna toss a million dollars
 
01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:51.830 align:start position:0%
and we're gonna toss a million dollars
at

01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
it so you say to yourself well what's a
 
01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars when you're working with
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
these i mean
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
the amount of money we deal with just
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
boggles the mind
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
however the house had not had
 
01:35:07.109 --> 01:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
a bill on this this had been a senate
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
bill that had then been put on the table
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
did not come to the house
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
so we were doing some research
 
01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
mr cain really did some digging in this
 
01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:19.189 align:start position:0%
mr cain really did some digging in this
morning

01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
and we discovered that for this benefit
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
there are 85 700
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
individuals eligible for this benefit
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
medicaid allows one thousand five
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
per person for the amount of the service
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
that you can receive
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
in a year some of that is a federal
 
01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:47.109 align:start position:0%
in a year some of that is a federal
share

01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
share
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately some of that is a state
 
01:35:49.679 --> 01:35:51.590 align:start position:0%
unfortunately some of that is a state
share

01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
share
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
and when the senate was looking at this
 
01:35:55.830 --> 01:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
the state share was
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
around seven million dollars
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
i had a note from mr kane
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
after that that already the medium range
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
of the cost had risen to 7.45 million
 
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
however the high range that we could
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
expect this to be on a yearly basis
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
is 11.06 million
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
this section i provided only three
 
01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.159 align:start position:0%
months of benefit
 
01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
but would greatly impact
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
legislatures going forward
 
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
did not have a hearing public hearing in
 
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
did not get seen by house hhs
 
01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
did not get referred to house finance
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
division three as a second committee to
 
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
dig into the funds
 
01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
so the house is going to continue to
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
hold on these sections
 
01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
well we think it's a good benefit when
 
01:36:58.629 --> 01:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
you look at
 
01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
committing somebody to pay 11 million
 
01:37:01.119 --> 01:37:02.149 align:start position:0%
committing somebody to pay 11 million
dollars

01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
when you haven't dug into all the
 
01:37:04.719 --> 01:37:05.830 align:start position:0%
when you haven't dug into all the
details

01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
details
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult so we're continuing
 
01:37:09.109 --> 01:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
to work
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
but we are not going to be at this time
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
able to move forward on that section
 
01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
that brings us to
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
page 332
 
01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
i skipped one i certainly did and i
 
01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:32.550 align:start position:0%
i skipped one i certainly did and i
apologize

01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
my apologies to the senators and
 
01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
representative edwards who was about to
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
leave his seat
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh we're on page 331
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
where people have it one way and we're
 
01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
sections 433 and 434
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
and i think we were going to ask lba
 
01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
if he could if they could dig into some
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
sections representative edwards says i
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
understand this
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
we just don't have any details how this
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
would be sent
 
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
etc do you want to talk about that uh
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh i've i've had
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
an opportunity
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
since uh this morning's meeting with you
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
to speak with the governor's
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
team and and while the governor's team
 
01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
still supports this 1.5 million
 
01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
i i think there's no argument to the
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
idea that
 
01:38:29.830 --> 01:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly small amount of money
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
without a particularly well-defined
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
statement of scope of what we would be
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
going out to buy
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
the senior centers there's approximately
 
01:38:41.590 --> 01:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
800 of them in the state that could
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
potentially compete for one and a half
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
and so this this program has sort of the
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
look and feel of something that had a
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
good intent but uh isn't set up for
 
01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:54.229 align:start position:0%
good intent but uh isn't set up for
success

01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
success
 
01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
and i i would i would ask us to hold it
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
and if we wanted to bring it back
 
01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
does the senate wish to speak
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
i mean again this is part of our ongoing
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
efforts to
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
try to deal with mental health um
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
obviously it targets seniors
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
um so that's why the senate
 
01:39:26.229 --> 01:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
you know voted for this and i think
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
there was a corresponding
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh 1.5 million dollar appropriation that
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
we've acceded to um
 
01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
for veterans so it's in the same
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
mental health problems that we're trying
 
01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:45.030 align:start position:0%
mental health problems that we're trying
to

01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
resolve we um you're correct
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
we did agree yesterday you had the 1.5
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
million for the veterans we had some
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
language that went together we merged
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
them together
 
01:39:59.350 --> 01:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
and we voted the new amendment in
 
01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:00.709 align:start position:0%
and we voted the new amendment in
yesterday

01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
so you're correct senator rosenwald did
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
i see you put your hand up
 
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair the senate
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
worked with the
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
advocates for seniors on this language
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
this was an item they had worked with
 
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
the governor's office on
 
01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
and they came to us and we agreed to
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
narrow the scope
 
01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
of what the appropriation could be used
 
01:40:25.119 --> 01:40:25.910 align:start position:0%
of what the appropriation could be used
for

01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
in the budget it's introduced it could
 
01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
be also
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
used for capital projects
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
and we didn't think there was enough
 
01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:36.159 align:start position:0%
money for that so
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
we limited the scope but found that
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
senior seniors in new hampshire were
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
particularly isolated and we were
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
concerned about their
 
01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
access to programs that would benefit
 
01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
their mental health
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
outside of uh traditional
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
please so i i agree
 
01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
and embrace the concern about our senior
 
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
citizens uh mental health after this
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
long pandemic and
 
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
long periods of uh of imposed isolation
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
i um i i think the issue remains that
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's only a million and a half dollars
 
01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
to be spread around
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh 800 senior centers
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
and uh the scope on this
 
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
in the bill simply says supporting
 
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
services to combat struggles with mental
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
health and social isolation
 
01:41:42.590 --> 01:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
and so that's not a a particularly
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
identifiable scope of work i don't know
 
01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
how we could effectively issue rfps and
 
01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
do the contracting
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
that would deliver something of value
 
01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:55.189 align:start position:0%
that would deliver something of value
and

01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
and and while i agree that we have a
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
problem i
 
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see this cooked a little bit
 
01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:01.910 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see this cooked a little bit
more

01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
i may be wrong but uh we've already
 
01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:14.950 align:start position:0%
i may be wrong but uh we've already
accepted

01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 1 i believe the increase to
 
01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:18.629 align:start position:0%
house bill 1 i believe the increase to
the

01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
senior centers in the state of new
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire in there
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
but they get paid i think that message
 
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
should be pretty loud and clear having
 
01:42:29.590 --> 01:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
served in the 90s as a
 
01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
president of these one of these boards
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
they're not making money
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
um i can assure you of that
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
if this needs to be fixed then you're
 
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
willing to work with the senate in
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
january to come up with something
 
01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
um you know i can tell you the rainy day
 
01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:47.669 align:start position:0%
um you know i can tell you the rainy day
fund's

01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:47.679 align:start position:0%
fund's
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
climbing up to 165 million just with a
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
few actions we've taken
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
and the um i i think there's going to be
 
01:42:58.629 --> 01:42:58.639 align:start position:0%
revenues left over from this year beyond
 
01:42:58.639 --> 01:42:59.270 align:start position:0%
revenues left over from this year beyond
that

01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
that we should do something to help
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
these groups
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
i'd be willing to file legislation with
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
you to do
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
something and define it better because
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
our discussions in the senate we
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
realized there wasn't enough money to do
 
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
it would be an honor and i would pull in
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh the chair of hhs
 
01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0%

01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%

still keeping this or you're proposing
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
something instead of this
 
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
if i could get the senate to vote with
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
me i'd say
 
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
to the house but i'm not sure i'll move
 
01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:45.830 align:start position:0%
to the house but i'm not sure i'll move
the

01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%

01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
seat to the house okay

not

01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:08.550 align:start position:0%
 
objecting

01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
okay that brings us now where i was
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
trying to go before when i was jumping
 
01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
the gun a little bit
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
to page 332
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
where i think it was senator gaida
 
01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
put in a motion an amendment
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
to lower the license fees
 
01:44:32.229 --> 01:44:32.239 align:start position:0%
by almost all the money for keno
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
the house hasn't had a bill on this i
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
don't know did you guys have a bill or
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
did this just come in
 
01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
what this lowers keno licenses to a
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars in
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
sooner morse i think it may be more
 
01:44:48.550 --> 01:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
effective to discuss
 
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
the next item first okay
 
01:44:55.669 --> 01:44:55.679 align:start position:0%
um which is senator geider also
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity i believe in keem
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
to give them the opportunity to get
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
historical racing
 
01:45:11.590 --> 01:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
i think the senate might look favorably
 
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
on the item before that to the house's
 
01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:15.189 align:start position:0%
on the item before that to the house's
position

01:45:15.189 --> 01:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
if we could give this one group the
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get in
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
i know everyone wants to expand it
 
01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
everywhere else
 
01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
um that's not the bill that came before
 
01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
the house or the senate
 
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
the villa came for the house and the
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
senate said let's do it for a period of
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
a couple of years
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
and then we'll look to open it up to the
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
whole state of new hampshire
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're discussing we're
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
discussing the opportunity of
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
one company that started at a certain
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
they have to apply for this and they
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of a hurdle to get
 
01:45:47.590 --> 01:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
there but
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
um i i think we could give them that
 
01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:51.189 align:start position:0%
um i i think we could give them that
opportunity

01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:45:53.189 --> 01:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
um along with the fact that we just
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
passed the bill so
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
if we could do that then we could talk
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
about the one before
 
01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte i believe you
 
01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
did the research into
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
the section on perry mutual pools we're
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
looking at section 440 sir
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh i did some research on on it issue
 
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
that i was not really
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
that familiar with in speaking to a
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
couple individuals
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
it appears the only change would be to
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
the house bill that we passed and that
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
was signed by the governor would be to
 
01:46:24.149 --> 01:46:24.159 align:start position:0%
change the date
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh the purpose of the original date was
 
01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:27.750 align:start position:0%
uh the purpose of the original date was
to

01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh establish a certain number of
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh locations as
 
01:46:37.590 --> 01:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
it were the ones that were in effect and
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
in speaking with a a few individuals on
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
01:46:43.750 --> 01:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
amendment change it was highly
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
recommended that
 
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
we remain uh with the existing language
 
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
and and the date
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
i know the senator just referenced an
 
01:46:55.590 --> 01:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
individual or a location in keene and
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
that was actually part of the
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
discussion i had so i i would be opposed
 
01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:01.270 align:start position:0%
discussion i had so i i would be opposed
to

01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
actually either either the two thank you
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
let's just hold on to these for a little
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
that is going to bring us
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
okay well yesterday we had an
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
interesting situation on page 346
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
first the house held it then we
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
discovered we had voted
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
in favor of this so we said go ahead
 
01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
but there was a question about whether
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
the governor had
 
01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
signed the bill whether this should be
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
in both the bill and
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
in here and then the senate said to hold
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
mr cain do you have any idea where we
 
01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:53.830 align:start position:0%
mr cain do you have any idea where we
are

01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:47:57.189 --> 01:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
with page 346 at this time that's still
 
01:47:58.629 --> 01:47:58.639 align:start position:0%
on hold i don't believe
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong that the
 
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
governor has signed with the bill yet
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
relative to the title behavioral in the
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
woodville fire district but
 
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
he has not signed it so right now that
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
section remains on hold
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
so yesterday we were trying to decide if
 
01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
we needed it at all
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
or if we could just get an amendment to
 
01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
delete it given it had been passed and
 
01:48:21.679 --> 01:48:22.070 align:start position:0%
delete it given it had been passed and
was

01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
i think in enrolled bills do we have any
 
01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:26.790 align:start position:0%
i think in enrolled bills do we have any
idea

01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:29.679 align:start position:0%
okay i'm not sure it's going to happen
 
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair because
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
i haven't signed this yet uh-huh so this
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
hasn't even gotten to the senate
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
president yet i don't think it's gotten
 
01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
to the speaker quite honestly
 
01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:40.639 align:start position:0%
well i don't think it can get to him if
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
it hasn't gotten to you but
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
well it's the other way around because
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
this was a senate bill
 
01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:49.590 align:start position:0%
this was a senate bill
um

01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
the senate is the one who's the last put
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:06.709 --> 01:49:06.719 align:start position:0%
to put it on hold still my point is
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
the day's up on thursday at 3 o'clock
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's not going to get stuck up in his
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
is there any reason we can't put it in
 
01:49:23.109 --> 01:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
we had agreed yesterday after i found
 
01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
out that we had
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
gentlemen shall we do that because we
 
01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
did vote for his house position to pass
 
01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:38.870 align:start position:0%
did vote for his house position to pass
this

01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
is it exactly the same as the bill we
 
01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:42.470 align:start position:0%
is it exactly the same as the bill we
passed

01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:45.990 align:start position:0%
passed
yes

01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
we will the house will exceed let's get
 
01:49:48.639 --> 01:49:49.910 align:start position:0%
we will the house will exceed let's get
this

01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
we're having lots of conversation about
 
01:49:59.589 --> 01:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
sections 4 51 which starts at the bottom
 
01:50:14.229 --> 01:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
of 348 through 340
 
01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
through 460 micro enterprise relief fund
 
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
save our granite stages fund mr kane can
 
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
sure i believe this remember where we
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
were yesterday uh the item remains on
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
hold it was
 
01:50:35.030 --> 01:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
in senate bill 132 which passed the
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
senate hat
 
01:50:37.669 --> 01:50:37.679 align:start position:0%
was laid on the table so the house has
 
01:50:46.229 --> 01:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
and if i recall correctly this is only
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
to be funded with federal funds
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct only to be funded with
 
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:08.709 --> 01:51:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
yeah could correspond burger
 
01:51:15.109 --> 01:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
yeah we i was very confused about the
 
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
one dollar
 
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
i mean it says so mr kane can you walk
 
01:51:21.510 --> 01:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
us through
 
01:51:24.149 --> 01:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
section 452 which is where we see this
 
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
confusing dollar in three different
 
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.790 align:start position:0%
confusing dollar in three different
lines

01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
yes a placeholder in section 352
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
um so one dollar of any federal funds
 
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
received by the state in response to
 
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
covet will be deposited into the fund
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
and at no
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
time shall the available balance i read
 
01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
that as available balance of the fund
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
exceed one dollar in any fiscal year
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
um and then there's a free i don't find
 
01:51:51.990 --> 01:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
that confusing
 
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
um it's there won't be a dollar in there
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
and it won't exceed a dollar that could
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
that won't buy me a glass of wine to get
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
through this
 
01:52:12.629 --> 01:52:12.639 align:start position:0%
might buy a bottle of water though which
 
01:52:12.639 --> 01:52:14.149 align:start position:0%
might buy a bottle of water though which
is

01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
um i think the if i recall correctly
 
01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
the maybe senator daniels can chime in
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
here but um
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
this was a placeholder for potential use
 
01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:27.990 align:start position:0%
this was a placeholder for potential use
of

01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
our funds um so
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
but do we shoot ourselves in the foot if
 
01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719 align:start position:0%
we say the fun
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
shall never be more than a dollar i'm
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
agreeing with you
 
01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
i you don't know that that was the
 
01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:01.910 align:start position:0%
i you don't know that that was the
intent

01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
i think the intent the intent was to
 
01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
mr cain would it be possible
 
01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
to get an amendment from the lba
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
to keep put a dollar in
 
01:53:22.709 --> 01:53:22.719 align:start position:0%
and keep the account open to receive
 
01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
federal funds which i think is what we
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
sure and so what you'll see is a few
 
01:53:32.149 --> 01:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
changes to the reference to a dollar as
 
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
a placeholder we'll just ensure that the
 
01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
when that dollar is used it's to open
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
that account only
 
01:53:39.910 --> 01:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
and then we'll make sure it's limited to
 
01:53:42.070 --> 01:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
the federal funds so we can draft that
 
01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:42.629 align:start position:0%
the federal funds so we can draft that
amendment

01:53:42.629 --> 01:53:42.639 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
who would like to be the sponsor i will
 
01:53:45.669 --> 01:53:45.679 align:start position:0%
i will
 
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
do that yes absolutely uh
 
01:53:51.589 --> 01:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
before he we sent him off is there
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
in this section that you guys
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
have an issue with before we move on to
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
sections not dealing with this so let's
 
01:54:14.070 --> 01:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
cena i don't see any but mr cain if
 
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
you and your staff see something will
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
you please take care of it so we have a
 
01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
good amendment
 
01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
tomorrow yes and i think you'll see it
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
again in section 457 the dollar
 
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
placeholder for the save our granted
 
01:54:30.390 --> 01:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
stages fund we'll just make sure that um
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
it does not restrict that fund to only a
 
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
dollar okay
 
01:54:40.030 --> 01:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:44.719 align:start position:0%
461 which is
 
01:54:46.709 --> 01:54:46.719 align:start position:0%
an amendment that we talked about
 
01:54:46.719 --> 01:54:47.990 align:start position:0%
an amendment that we talked about
yesterday

01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
this is adding additional service
 
01:54:53.669 --> 01:54:53.679 align:start position:0%
additional staff in the child protective
 
01:54:53.679 --> 01:54:54.790 align:start position:0%
additional staff in the child protective
service

01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:54:58.950 --> 01:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
area of dcyf and i think we're all aware
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
if you read the newspaper watch the news
 
01:55:03.189 --> 01:55:03.199 align:start position:0%
you are aware that we have had
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
some fairly significant issues and we're
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
all worried about
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
keeping our children as safe as possible
 
01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
and especially children that get
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
put in the state care and are no longer
 
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
with their parents
 
01:55:21.669 --> 01:55:21.679 align:start position:0%
and so yesterday we were asking the same
 
01:55:21.679 --> 01:55:22.709 align:start position:0%
and so yesterday we were asking the same
questions

01:55:22.709 --> 01:55:22.719 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
about does this apply to the 3000
 
01:55:29.669 --> 01:55:29.679 align:start position:0%
employee limit that is in hb1 mr ripple
 
01:55:32.229 --> 01:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
i believe you have confirmed
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
to us that that 3 000 employee limit
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
applies here that's correct yes
 
01:55:41.350 --> 01:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative edwards
 
01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak
 
01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
at all in section 461 no ma'am i think
 
01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
he said it all i i think we're prepared
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
to accede to the
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
senate language okay so the house will
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
exceed to the senate
 
01:55:59.310 --> 01:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
462. i think we probably have some
 
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
questions we don't
 
01:56:06.149 --> 01:56:06.159 align:start position:0%
really understand what we're doing there
 
01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
representative edwards do you want to
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
speak to 462 that's also a
 
01:56:13.589 --> 01:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
dhhs thank you thank you madam chair
 
01:56:16.629 --> 01:56:16.639 align:start position:0%
um so um towards the
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
end of our hearings in division three
 
01:56:20.149 --> 01:56:20.159 align:start position:0%
well we
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
were uh basically out of money with uh
 
01:56:24.790 --> 01:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
what we had funded
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
and so when we received a list from dhhs
 
01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
on things that they would like to have
 
01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
that we had not funded this item
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
was on that list it went over to the
 
01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:37.189 align:start position:0%
was on that list it went over to the
senate

01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
um and so we we didn't we never
 
01:56:41.669 --> 01:56:41.679 align:start position:0%
considered it in division three
 
01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
so it's six hundred thousand dollars
 
01:56:45.109 --> 01:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
each of
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
each fiscal year for 1.2 million total
 
01:56:50.310 --> 01:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
it's intended to fund community
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
collaboration and parental assistance
 
01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:54.229 align:start position:0%
collaboration and parental assistance
programs

01:56:54.229 --> 01:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
i i have to admit i don't know exactly
 
01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
what that's going to do
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
but i'm i'm willing to uh trust the
 
01:57:03.669 --> 01:57:03.679 align:start position:0%
the judgment and wisdom of the senate on
 
01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
this um i'm i'm happy to accede to this
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
it would be nice to get an explanation
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
though my question
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
to represent edwards had been
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
we have a system of care we have as i
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
understand it 13 million dollars
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
that will non-lapse from this year that
 
01:57:26.070 --> 01:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
will move forward into the next biennium
 
01:57:27.910 --> 01:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's also my understanding that we put
 
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
27 million
 
01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
in this next biennium's budget into the
 
01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
system of care
 
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
which gives us a total of 40 million in
 
01:57:37.109 --> 01:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
the system of care
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
and i wondered if any of that would be
 
01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
used in
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
some of this or in collaborating with
 
01:57:44.229 --> 01:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
this and again we don't really
 
01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
understand this section so
 
01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
if somebody could speak to that senator
 
01:57:50.950 --> 01:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
roosevelt it looks like the ball fell in
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
your life i can speak to it
 
01:57:55.589 --> 01:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
from a high level that would be better
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
than what we know thank you
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
so the these are programs that are
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
primary prevention um
 
01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
to keep children and families out of
 
01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:07.990 align:start position:0%
to keep children and families out of
dcyf

01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
dcyf
 
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
this is not a division of behavioral
 
01:58:14.070 --> 01:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
it also helps

happening more often the community
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
collaboration was a competitive grant
 
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
that the state was awarded
 
01:58:43.589 --> 01:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
and i don't know the amount offhand but
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
it also brings in
 
01:58:48.390 --> 01:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
significant federal funds so it's really
 
01:58:50.070 --> 01:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
more about
 
01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%

the same between the house and senate
 
02:00:02.229 --> 02:00:02.239 align:start position:0%
we worked together well but we also came
 
02:00:03.990 --> 02:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
up independently with much of the same
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%

02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
there was a bill i think it started in
 
02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
the senate and it came to
 
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
the house about abolishing the gun line
 
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
which we both have passed
 
02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative umberger did a great deal
 
02:00:38.070 --> 02:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
of work
 
02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
and is going to talk about this
 
02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:47.669 --> 02:00:47.679 align:start position:0%
thank you uh since
 
02:00:51.470 --> 02:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
h or sb 141 and hb
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
334 have passed
 
02:00:59.109 --> 02:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
the house and the senate they basically
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
end the gun line
 
02:01:07.350 --> 02:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
we had added to the budget
 
02:01:15.189 --> 02:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
three positions for safety
 
02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
in order to improve the
 
02:01:21.669 --> 02:01:21.679 align:start position:0%
gun line since
 
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
the other two bills have passed
 
02:01:30.229 --> 02:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh we do not need these positions for
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
the gun line
 
02:01:36.229 --> 02:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
however in that in
 
02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
141 it also
 
02:01:44.070 --> 02:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
said that safety would pay for
 
02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
computer software and training for
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
the county sheriffs however there was no
 
02:01:51.119 --> 02:01:51.910 align:start position:0%
the county sheriffs however there was no
money

02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
actually appropriated and so
 
02:01:59.350 --> 02:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
this also asked for the hundred thousand
 
02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:02.070 align:start position:0%
this also asked for the hundred thousand
dollars

02:02:02.070 --> 02:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
for the counties and each county will
 
02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:06.229 align:start position:0%
for the counties and each county will
get

02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars and we
 
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
it finalizes and the contingency down at
 
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
the bottom
 
02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
because neither of these bills have been
 
02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
signed that
 
02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
if they don't become law
 
02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
then we will not delete
 
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
the three positions from safety
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:38.960 align:start position:0%

was to keep sb 85 as it was however we
 
02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:28.630 align:start position:0%
was to keep sb 85 as it was however we

by the legislature in the past instead
 
02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:56.389 align:start position:0%

02:56:56.389 --> 02:56:56.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:56:58.309 --> 02:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
messing around with effective dates but
 
02:56:59.429 --> 02:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
the language
 
02:57:02.630 --> 02:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
of senate bill 85 is included with one
 
02:57:05.750 --> 02:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
main change and that is on i believe
 
02:57:06.950 --> 02:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
beginning on line
 
02:57:10.230 --> 02:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
13 where instead of osi
 
02:57:12.070 --> 02:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's in the department of business and
 
02:57:13.910 --> 02:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
economic affairs
 
02:57:17.030 --> 02:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
as a result you'll see on row 16 it's
 
02:57:17.040 --> 02:57:18.110 align:start position:0%
as a result you'll see on row 16 it's
under

02:57:18.110 --> 02:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:57:21.349 --> 02:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
rsa-120 the broadband matching grant
 
02:57:23.110 --> 02:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
initiative is established
 
02:57:25.190 --> 02:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
in all references to strategic
 
02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:26.550 align:start position:0%
in all references to strategic
initiatives

02:57:26.550 --> 02:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
initiatives
 
02:57:28.630 --> 02:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
should have been removed and replaced
 
02:57:32.950 --> 02:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:35.830 --> 02:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
senator bradley um could i just ask uh
 
02:57:38.070 --> 02:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
mr kane a couple of questions absolutely
 
02:57:41.910 --> 02:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
all right so um been here a long time
 
02:57:42.790 --> 02:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
but i've never
 
02:57:45.190 --> 02:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
seen a nullification of prior
 
02:57:46.469 --> 02:57:46.479 align:start position:0%
legislation so
 
02:57:50.710 --> 02:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
this is rather uncommon is that correct
 
02:57:54.469 --> 02:57:54.479 align:start position:0%
it's um since i've been here it's
 
02:57:56.790 --> 02:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
uncommon it has occurred a few times
 
02:57:59.510 --> 02:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
when you do have when house bill 2 is
 
02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:00.309 align:start position:0%
when you do have when house bill 2 is
typically

02:58:00.309 --> 02:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
typically
 
02:58:02.790 --> 02:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
when you will see it where you'll have a
 
02:58:04.469 --> 02:58:04.479 align:start position:0%
bill that's passed
 
02:58:07.429 --> 02:58:07.439 align:start position:0%
and um there is a conflict that the
 
02:58:08.950 --> 02:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
committee is made aware of
 
02:58:11.110 --> 02:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh this is this i've probably seen this
 
02:58:12.790 --> 02:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
a handful of times but it's not the
 
02:58:12.800 --> 02:58:13.590 align:start position:0%
a handful of times but it's not the
regular

02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
regular
 
02:58:16.630 --> 02:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
way to do it all right so just so i'm
 
02:58:17.670 --> 02:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
really clear
 
02:58:22.790 --> 02:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
hb2 would nullify senate bill 85 the
 
02:58:27.510 --> 02:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
broadband initiative
 
02:58:32.790 --> 02:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
but if hb2 were not enacted into law
 
02:58:35.830 --> 02:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill 85 would that has been
 
02:58:35.840 --> 02:58:36.469 align:start position:0%
senate bill 85 would that has been
correct

02:58:36.469 --> 02:58:36.479 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:58:38.309 --> 02:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
that would proceed as its own path yes
 
02:58:39.830 --> 02:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
correct so either way it
 
02:58:43.269 --> 02:58:43.279 align:start position:0%
either nullifies and in
 
02:58:46.309 --> 02:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
hb2 or it's not touched
 
02:58:49.349 --> 02:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay okay
 
02:58:51.990 --> 02:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
all right i'll move the amendment
 
02:58:54.990 --> 02:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
senator bradley moves amendment
 
02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:56.150 align:start position:0%
senator bradley moves amendment
2021-1969-h

02:58:56.150 --> 02:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
2021-1969-h
 
02:59:00.950 --> 02:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
and represent weiler seconds
 
02:59:02.870 --> 02:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
if the house is in favor of adopting
 
02:59:05.590 --> 02:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
this please raise your hand
 
02:59:10.070 --> 02:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
the senate we're unanimous on that
 
02:59:12.950 --> 02:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
mr cain i think we were waiting for an
 
02:59:16.230 --> 02:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
amendment on the sununu center
 
02:59:21.990 --> 02:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
yes amendment 19 uh 2021 199918 we will
 
02:59:22.870 --> 02:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
hand out
 
02:59:33.590 --> 02:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:47.590 --> 02:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:50.469 --> 02:59:50.479 align:start position:0%
this amendment refers to sections 326
 
02:59:52.389 --> 02:59:52.399 align:start position:0%
through 330.
 
02:59:55.429 --> 02:59:55.439 align:start position:0%
represent weiler are you or
 
02:59:57.590 --> 02:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative edwards going to speak to
 
02:59:57.600 --> 02:59:58.550 align:start position:0%
representative edwards going to speak to
this

02:59:58.550 --> 02:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:00:01.910 --> 03:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
if representative edwards is prepared
 
03:00:03.910 --> 03:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative weiler moves the adoption
 
03:00:06.309 --> 03:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
of 2021-199
 
03:00:09.510 --> 03:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
h1 but why don't we hear the
 
03:00:16.469 --> 03:00:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:18.309 --> 03:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
because i think this is enough change we
 
03:00:19.750 --> 03:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
may have to hold and think on this
 
03:00:19.760 --> 03:00:21.269 align:start position:0%
may have to hold and think on this
overnight

03:00:21.269 --> 03:00:21.279 align:start position:0%
overnight
 
03:00:24.469 --> 03:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair i i agree with you um
 
03:00:28.230 --> 03:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
and i i i do think it's possible that um
 
03:00:29.990 --> 03:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's still an opportunity for
 
03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:31.269 align:start position:0%
there's still an opportunity for
wordsmithing

03:00:31.269 --> 03:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
wordsmithing
 
03:00:34.950 --> 03:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh is here but uh but this is uh this is
 
03:00:34.960 --> 03:00:36.230 align:start position:0%
uh is here but uh but this is uh this is
represents

03:00:36.230 --> 03:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
represents
 
03:00:39.670 --> 03:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
um i think a good faith effort
 
03:00:42.150 --> 03:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
to do a high bred piece of uh
 
03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:43.510 align:start position:0%
to do a high bred piece of uh
legislation

03:00:43.510 --> 03:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:00:46.710 --> 03:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
around the idea that we uh both chambers
 
03:00:47.830 --> 03:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
have committed
 
03:00:51.269 --> 03:00:51.279 align:start position:0%
to closing the sununu center in this
 
03:00:54.469 --> 03:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
budget um and so we
 
03:00:57.590 --> 03:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
with this hybrid a key thing that we've
 
03:00:59.349 --> 03:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
started out with is
 
03:01:03.510 --> 03:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
reintroducing the hb 254 language
 
03:01:05.890 --> 03:01:05.900 align:start position:0%
to reduce the
 
03:01:05.900 --> 03:01:07.670 align:start position:0%
to reduce the
[Music]

03:01:07.670 --> 03:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:01:10.309 --> 03:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
the number of potential candidates there
 
03:01:12.469 --> 03:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
might be for incarceration
 
03:01:14.870 --> 03:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
by reducing those the numbers of those
 
03:01:16.950 --> 03:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
being incarcerated
 
03:01:20.230 --> 03:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
that is obviously thought to be
 
03:01:21.269 --> 03:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
beneficial to
 
03:01:24.630 --> 03:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
the youth involved but will also serve a
 
03:01:26.790 --> 03:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
logistical advantage of just having
 
03:01:28.790 --> 03:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
fewer people to worry about
 
03:01:32.309 --> 03:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
transitioning so so you'll see on page
 
03:01:32.319 --> 03:01:33.269 align:start position:0%
transitioning so so you'll see on page
one

03:01:33.269 --> 03:01:33.279 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:01:36.070 --> 03:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
and then on page two and uh bold
 
03:01:36.080 --> 03:01:37.190 align:start position:0%
and then on page two and uh bold
highlights

03:01:37.190 --> 03:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
highlights
 
03:01:40.630 --> 03:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
the um the reintroduction of uh
 
03:01:44.150 --> 03:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
components of hb 254.
 
03:01:49.349 --> 03:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
we've added um some language to
 
03:01:52.469 --> 03:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
allow some flexibility though if the if
 
03:01:55.030 --> 03:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
there's still the possibility that uh
 
03:01:58.469 --> 03:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
youth may represent a threat to society
 
03:02:02.309 --> 03:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh this by is indicated by a substantial
 
03:02:04.309 --> 03:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
risk of harm to others
 
03:02:07.670 --> 03:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
um that it can go before court
 
03:02:10.469 --> 03:02:10.479 align:start position:0%
where the judge can do an evidentiary
 
03:02:10.479 --> 03:02:11.429 align:start position:0%
where the judge can do an evidentiary
hearing

03:02:11.429 --> 03:02:11.439 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:02:14.230 --> 03:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
and get specific case findings relative
 
03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:15.510 align:start position:0%
and get specific case findings relative
to

03:02:15.510 --> 03:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:02:18.710 --> 03:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
that child's or that that
 
03:02:21.910 --> 03:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
juvenile's threat status
 
03:02:26.070 --> 03:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
and make a determination if that
 
03:02:27.510 --> 03:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
individual should be committed or
 
03:02:27.520 --> 03:02:29.349 align:start position:0%
individual should be committed or
incarcerated

03:02:29.349 --> 03:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
incarcerated
 
03:02:33.349 --> 03:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh on the next page page four
 
03:02:36.150 --> 03:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh uh we've accepted the senate budget
 
03:02:36.160 --> 03:02:37.110 align:start position:0%
uh uh we've accepted the senate budget
numbers

03:02:37.110 --> 03:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
03:02:40.469 --> 03:02:40.479 align:start position:0%
uh and and terms so so
 
03:02:42.630 --> 03:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
the you'll see a lot of familiar stuff
 
03:02:44.469 --> 03:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
in there
 
03:02:47.990 --> 03:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
on page four
 
03:02:52.469 --> 03:02:52.479 align:start position:0%
uh down around lines 29 or so
 
03:02:55.990 --> 03:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
what we've done is we've said it's line
 
03:02:58.630 --> 03:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
24 actually the that we've we
 
03:03:00.230 --> 03:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
we would like you to consider a closure
 
03:03:03.670 --> 03:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
date of 1 october uh 2022.
 
03:03:07.110 --> 03:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh you uh had the senate had determined
 
03:03:07.120 --> 03:03:07.510 align:start position:0%
uh you uh had the senate had determined
that

03:03:07.510 --> 03:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:03:12.230 --> 03:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
um that march of 2023 would be
 
03:03:14.150 --> 03:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate to give plenty of time for
 
03:03:16.630 --> 03:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
the planning and execution
 
03:03:20.070 --> 03:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
what the concern there was is that
 
03:03:21.990 --> 03:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
we really want to make sure that
 
03:03:23.590 --> 03:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
everyone is committed
 
03:03:26.550 --> 03:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
to closing the sununu center and that
 
03:03:27.349 --> 03:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
03:03:30.309 --> 03:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
postponing actions critical actions
 
03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
until the next legislature's in session
 
03:03:36.150 --> 03:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh in other words you know this this
 
03:03:39.269 --> 03:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
this is the time we are the people let's
 
03:03:40.150 --> 03:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
get it closed
 
03:03:44.309 --> 03:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
so we we're recommending one october um
 
03:03:47.190 --> 03:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
the the number five beds do you have a
 
03:03:49.030 --> 03:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
question senator bradley or do you
 
03:03:52.230 --> 03:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
okay um so
 
03:03:55.990 --> 03:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
on line 31
 
03:03:59.190 --> 03:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
we have um inserted the number of five
 
03:03:59.200 --> 03:03:59.670 align:start position:0%
we have um inserted the number of five
beds

03:03:59.670 --> 03:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
beds
 
03:04:02.870 --> 03:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh 18 beds had been floated you know i'm
 
03:04:05.110 --> 03:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
i i don't think anyone can predict
 
03:04:07.110 --> 03:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
exactly what the number ought to be
 
03:04:08.950 --> 03:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
if if the senate were to come back with
 
03:04:10.309 --> 03:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
a different number i wouldn't be
 
03:04:13.429 --> 03:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
surprised we
 
03:04:16.710 --> 03:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
then at the bottom of that page prohibit
 
03:04:19.510 --> 03:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
any external funds being used by the
 
03:04:21.670 --> 03:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
joint fiscal committee to
 
03:04:24.389 --> 03:04:24.399 align:start position:0%
continue the operation of the sununu
 
03:04:24.399 --> 03:04:24.950 align:start position:0%
continue the operation of the sununu
center

03:04:24.950 --> 03:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
center
 
03:04:26.790 --> 03:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
beyond its closure date there's a
 
03:04:29.030 --> 03:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
prohibition on use of funds
 
03:04:31.830 --> 03:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
we we do limit the use of funds though
 
03:04:31.840 --> 03:04:32.230 align:start position:0%
we we do limit the use of funds though
to

03:04:32.230 --> 03:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:04:33.990 --> 03:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
weatherproofing and i don't see a
 
03:04:35.910 --> 03:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
definition of weatherproofing i would i
 
03:04:35.920 --> 03:04:36.550 align:start position:0%
definition of weatherproofing i would i
would

03:04:36.550 --> 03:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:04:38.469 --> 03:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
think that that may include a more
 
03:04:39.990 --> 03:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
generic set of
 
03:04:41.830 --> 03:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
building and infrastructure maintenance
 
03:04:43.030 --> 03:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
so that
 
03:04:45.670 --> 03:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't fall into such disrepair that
 
03:04:47.750 --> 03:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
it becomes a negative asset but
 
03:04:50.070 --> 03:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
but the term weatherproofing is is used
 
03:04:52.230 --> 03:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
in the current version
 
03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh on page five um
 
03:05:00.469 --> 03:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
rounds line nine through eleven uh we've
 
03:05:04.389 --> 03:05:04.399 align:start position:0%
we've established the committee um and
 
03:05:07.429 --> 03:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
we've specifically intended to insert
 
03:05:09.830 --> 03:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
the possibility that the committee would
 
03:05:12.230 --> 03:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
come up with a repurposing
 
03:05:15.349 --> 03:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
of the sununu center and and not
 
03:05:18.230 --> 03:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
be locked into the idea that they have
 
03:05:20.550 --> 03:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
to build a new facility
 
03:05:22.790 --> 03:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's a relatively new set of
 
03:05:24.469 --> 03:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
facilities out there
 
03:05:27.190 --> 03:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
and given that we just want fewer kids
 
03:05:28.389 --> 03:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
in there
 
03:05:29.910 --> 03:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
there ought to be a way to do a
 
03:05:32.150 --> 03:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
renovation and leverage that
 
03:05:35.670 --> 03:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
asset so so we don't we don't we're not
 
03:05:37.830 --> 03:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
requiring a repurposing but we're saying
 
03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
that repurposing as a potential
 
03:05:44.790 --> 03:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
committee outcome then
 
03:05:48.870 --> 03:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
when we get down to lines
 
03:05:52.150 --> 03:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
22 through 25
 
03:05:55.190 --> 03:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
um i i i think we may want to
 
03:05:58.150 --> 03:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
take a look at this language um you know
 
03:05:59.510 --> 03:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
senator bradley i know
 
03:06:02.070 --> 03:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
you're good at reading these things it
 
03:06:02.080 --> 03:06:02.710 align:start position:0%
you're good at reading these things it
says

03:06:02.710 --> 03:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
says
 
03:06:05.190 --> 03:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
that the committee plans shall consider
 
03:06:06.469 --> 03:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
the following
 
03:06:09.030 --> 03:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
but then in the very next line it says
 
03:06:11.269 --> 03:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
it shall be operated by the department
 
03:06:13.030 --> 03:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
of health and human services
 
03:06:16.070 --> 03:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
so if that's a consideration of a shall
 
03:06:18.230 --> 03:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's one thing but if the shall
 
03:06:20.070 --> 03:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
overcomes the consideration and it
 
03:06:23.429 --> 03:06:23.439 align:start position:0%
becomes it must be operated by dhhs
 
03:06:25.349 --> 03:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how the lingual legal
 
03:06:27.510 --> 03:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
language works there
 
03:06:31.110 --> 03:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
but i i i don't want to forestall
 
03:06:34.790 --> 03:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
or require a particular recommendation
 
03:06:36.309 --> 03:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
to come from this committee they should
 
03:06:36.319 --> 03:06:38.389 align:start position:0%
to come from this committee they should
have

03:06:38.389 --> 03:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:06:40.870 --> 03:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
freedom of thought and flexibility and
 
03:06:43.030 --> 03:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation i believe
 
03:06:46.550 --> 03:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
and from there um
 
03:06:49.349 --> 03:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
i i'll admit that i just got this
 
03:06:49.359 --> 03:06:49.910 align:start position:0%
i i'll admit that i just got this
version

03:06:49.910 --> 03:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
version
 
03:06:52.230 --> 03:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh moments before it got handed out to
 
03:06:53.030 --> 03:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
you so
 
03:06:55.110 --> 03:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
at that point i've actually stopped
 
03:06:56.309 --> 03:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
reading and i don't have an
 
03:06:59.590 --> 03:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
analysis for you but in summary i i
 
03:07:02.870 --> 03:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
i'd say i i i think we're i think we're
 
03:07:03.510 --> 03:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
03:07:05.349 --> 03:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
agree figure out how to agree with the
 
03:07:07.349 --> 03:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
senate on this and just get it done
 
03:07:09.590 --> 03:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's our goal thank you
 
03:07:11.030 --> 03:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
03:07:14.710 --> 03:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
mr kane i just got this amendment as it
 
03:07:16.070 --> 03:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
was handed down
 
03:07:18.150 --> 03:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
yes and representative edwards did a
 
03:07:20.469 --> 03:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
good job of summarizing but he went from
 
03:07:22.790 --> 03:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
page one to page four could you just for
 
03:07:24.150 --> 03:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
my simple mind
 
03:07:26.309 --> 03:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
run us through all the sections
 
03:07:28.950 --> 03:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
including what we didn't because i
 
03:07:30.710 --> 03:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
was listening to him i can't read and
 
03:07:32.150 --> 03:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
listen at the same time
 
03:07:34.309 --> 03:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
if you could please yes kevin would love
 
03:07:35.670 --> 03:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
to oh kevin
 
03:07:38.870 --> 03:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay kevin you're up
 
03:07:40.950 --> 03:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh to be honest i'm not the best person
 
03:07:43.110 --> 03:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
either to discuss the uh content of
 
03:07:44.790 --> 03:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
these changes all i can tell you is that
 
03:07:46.790 --> 03:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
broadly speaking they incorporate
 
03:07:49.349 --> 03:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 254 which changes the
 
03:07:51.190 --> 03:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
criteria for detention and commitment of
 
03:07:51.200 --> 03:07:51.990 align:start position:0%
criteria for detention and commitment of
minors

03:07:51.990 --> 03:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
minors
 
03:07:53.190 --> 03:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
but even then there are a few
 
03:07:55.349 --> 03:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
modifications in here to the house bill
 
03:07:57.670 --> 03:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
254 language but again i'm not the best
 
03:07:58.790 --> 03:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
person to speak to that
 
03:08:02.950 --> 03:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
where is house bill 254
 
03:08:13.110 --> 03:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:15.269 --> 03:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
so as you know madam chair 254's
 
03:08:17.349 --> 03:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
language was incorporated in house bill
 
03:08:17.359 --> 03:08:17.830 align:start position:0%
language was incorporated in house bill
2

03:08:17.830 --> 03:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
2
 
03:08:20.550 --> 03:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
and was removed by the senate but where
 
03:08:22.790 --> 03:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
is house bill 254
 
03:08:25.030 --> 03:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
did we pass it it was retained by the
 
03:08:27.429 --> 03:08:27.439 align:start position:0%
house it was retained by the house in
 
03:08:27.439 --> 03:08:28.710 align:start position:0%
house it was retained by the house in
committee

03:08:28.710 --> 03:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:08:30.870 --> 03:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh yes actually it's retained in house
 
03:08:30.880 --> 03:08:32.870 align:start position:0%
uh yes actually it's retained in house
finance

03:08:32.870 --> 03:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
finance
 
03:08:35.750 --> 03:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay in division three must have 254 is
 
03:08:37.990 --> 03:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
that correct representative edward
 
03:08:43.750 --> 03:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:45.670 --> 03:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
okay well i'm still back too i don't
 
03:08:47.590 --> 03:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
know what these sections say because i
 
03:08:51.030 --> 03:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:53.750 --> 03:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
and not all this is bolded so i don't
 
03:08:56.150 --> 03:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
really know how much is new language and
 
03:08:57.190 --> 03:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
how much is not
 
03:09:00.309 --> 03:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
new language since i don't
 
03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
haven't seen 254 ma'am yeah
 
03:09:06.790 --> 03:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
sooner morse yeah well the senate would
 
03:09:07.990 --> 03:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
like to discuss
 
03:09:10.230 --> 03:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
what they have in the budget because i'm
 
03:09:11.429 --> 03:09:11.439 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
03:09:14.950 --> 03:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
we're that far off and the um i
 
03:09:16.630 --> 03:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
i think when the senate received the
 
03:09:18.150 --> 03:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
budget from the house
 
03:09:21.190 --> 03:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
it basically was we fund year one and
 
03:09:21.200 --> 03:09:21.990 align:start position:0%
it basically was we fund year one and
nothing

03:09:21.990 --> 03:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
03:09:24.790 --> 03:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
nothing that's what we received okay so
 
03:09:27.030 --> 03:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
when we received it we said well
 
03:09:30.309 --> 03:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
we got to find a solution because you
 
03:09:32.070 --> 03:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
can't just drop it
 
03:09:33.590 --> 03:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
i know some people would like to see
 
03:09:36.150 --> 03:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
that happen but there's realities out
 
03:09:37.590 --> 03:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
here and i think you could probably go
 
03:09:40.870 --> 03:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
out and talk to law enforcement
 
03:09:42.469 --> 03:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
about the fact that there are some
 
03:09:44.389 --> 03:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
realities about
 
03:09:47.590 --> 03:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
you know the sununu center but the when
 
03:09:50.389 --> 03:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
we decided to do this we put in
 
03:09:53.349 --> 03:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
um this finding because we like the
 
03:09:54.710 --> 03:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
house said
 
03:09:56.550 --> 03:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
we don't want this to be decided by the
 
03:09:58.070 --> 03:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
next legislature
 
03:10:01.349 --> 03:10:01.359 align:start position:0%
so we basically said that
 
03:10:04.150 --> 03:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
it needs to be closed by march 1st and
 
03:10:05.990 --> 03:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
the replacement needs to be open by
 
03:10:07.110 --> 03:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
march 1st
 
03:10:09.910 --> 03:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
anyone that's looking at construction
 
03:10:12.150 --> 03:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
realizes that that construction has to
 
03:10:15.110 --> 03:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
start under this legislature
 
03:10:18.150 --> 03:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
so we went one step further when we put
 
03:10:19.670 --> 03:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
the committee together
 
03:10:22.389 --> 03:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
we said they had to report to kenny by
 
03:10:23.510 --> 03:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
november 1st
 
03:10:26.950 --> 03:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
of this fall so that he could
 
03:10:30.229 --> 03:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
if he had to propose language
 
03:10:33.030 --> 03:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
that we take up in january if there were
 
03:10:35.429 --> 03:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
to be a change to where we are today
 
03:10:38.550 --> 03:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
18 is a good example um running it with
 
03:10:39.349 --> 03:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
the department
 
03:10:42.389 --> 03:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
is a good example but the reality of
 
03:10:44.309 --> 03:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
where we were trying to get to
 
03:10:49.030 --> 03:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
was how do we function in 22 and 23.
 
03:10:51.190 --> 03:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's where we're trying to get to so
 
03:10:52.950 --> 03:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
we agree with the house
 
03:10:55.110 --> 03:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
that closure's going to happen there's
 
03:10:56.790 --> 03:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
no one backing off on that
 
03:10:59.190 --> 03:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
we agree that these five members will
 
03:11:00.630 --> 03:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
work this summer
 
03:11:04.710 --> 03:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
report to kenny and when they report
 
03:11:06.870 --> 03:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
basically we figured if legislation was
 
03:11:08.309 --> 03:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
needed in january
 
03:11:10.550 --> 03:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
it would be this legislature that either
 
03:11:12.309 --> 03:11:12.319 align:start position:0%
has to appropriate because remember
 
03:11:14.150 --> 03:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's no money in here to build
 
03:11:17.190 --> 03:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
anything or to repurpose the current
 
03:11:18.790 --> 03:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
building which
 
03:11:20.469 --> 03:11:20.479 align:start position:0%
i'm probably more in favor of that than
 
03:11:22.710 --> 03:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
anything but i'm not sure
 
03:11:24.389 --> 03:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
that you're going to get that support
 
03:11:26.229 --> 03:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
from anybody in the public to be honest
 
03:11:27.830 --> 03:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
with you
 
03:11:29.830 --> 03:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
but there's a whole bunch of things that
 
03:11:31.590 --> 03:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
are going to happen along the way
 
03:11:33.990 --> 03:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
the senate was basically just picking up
 
03:11:35.269 --> 03:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
03:11:37.510 --> 03:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have a way to function after
 
03:11:39.510 --> 03:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
this budget year coming up
 
03:11:42.389 --> 03:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
that's what we were doing um if we were
 
03:11:43.510 --> 03:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
to go through this
 
03:11:46.950 --> 03:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
and make things happen um quicker
 
03:11:49.030 --> 03:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the proposal would be
 
03:11:49.040 --> 03:11:49.990 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the proposal would be
but

03:11:49.990 --> 03:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:11:51.429 --> 03:11:51.439 align:start position:0%
i don't think it would break the center
 
03:11:53.590 --> 03:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
tire to come back in january and say
 
03:11:55.750 --> 03:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
take back the 9 million that we have in
 
03:11:58.309 --> 03:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
here too because we got a solution
 
03:12:00.870 --> 03:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
but i think we're beating a horse here
 
03:12:02.630 --> 03:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
that we don't have to beat
 
03:12:05.830 --> 03:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
because everybody's in agreement i mean
 
03:12:07.510 --> 03:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
there is no way something's not going to
 
03:12:10.550 --> 03:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
start next year under this legislature
 
03:12:14.389 --> 03:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
and you know using 23 or october is the
 
03:12:14.399 --> 03:12:15.030 align:start position:0%
and you know using 23 or october is the
date

03:12:15.030 --> 03:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
date
 
03:12:16.710 --> 03:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's physically possible
 
03:12:18.630 --> 03:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
to have it open in october
 
03:12:21.429 --> 03:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
if if we're building something um if
 
03:12:22.870 --> 03:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to repurpose
 
03:12:26.790 --> 03:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
maybe but i the reality is
 
03:12:28.950 --> 03:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
this group of five needs to get together
 
03:12:30.070 --> 03:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
and get going
 
03:12:31.670 --> 03:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
i mean it's stated right in here it's
 
03:12:33.590 --> 03:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
going to be closed and it's going to be
 
03:12:33.600 --> 03:12:34.950 align:start position:0%
going to be closed and it's going to be
closed

03:12:34.950 --> 03:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
closed
 
03:12:38.309 --> 03:12:38.319 align:start position:0%
under our guidelines so i'm not sure
 
03:12:40.150 --> 03:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
what we're arguing about on this
 
03:12:42.309 --> 03:12:42.319 align:start position:0%
um and i'm not sure we're not trying to
 
03:12:43.190 --> 03:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
i agree with
 
03:12:45.910 --> 03:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative edwards there's probably
 
03:12:47.510 --> 03:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
things i want to change right now
 
03:12:49.670 --> 03:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
so if that if that had to happen when we
 
03:12:52.870 --> 03:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:55.590 --> 03:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
that we can change things i i don't care
 
03:12:57.030 --> 03:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
but the only change that the senate
 
03:12:58.070 --> 03:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
won't accept is
 
03:13:01.110 --> 03:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
that we're closing it okay i i tell you
 
03:13:01.120 --> 03:13:01.510 align:start position:0%
that we're closing it okay i i tell you
what

03:13:01.510 --> 03:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:13:02.790 --> 03:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
let's go back to your very first
 
03:13:05.590 --> 03:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
statement mr kane
 
03:13:08.469 --> 03:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
maybe this will be more up your alley
 
03:13:10.469 --> 03:13:10.479 align:start position:0%
can i ask you because senator moore
 
03:13:11.349 --> 03:13:11.359 align:start position:0%
started with
 
03:13:12.870 --> 03:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
i think we should run through the
 
03:13:15.670 --> 03:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
senate's proposal on the sununu center
 
03:13:18.950 --> 03:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay why don't we run through that a
 
03:13:21.269 --> 03:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
section at a time
 
03:13:24.309 --> 03:13:24.319 align:start position:0%
and we have representative edwards and
 
03:13:26.150 --> 03:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
senator morris
 
03:13:29.030 --> 03:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
who both know if it's in the senate if
 
03:13:29.670 --> 03:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
it's in
 
03:13:31.910 --> 03:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment we were just handed and
 
03:13:34.309 --> 03:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
so we can start to identify where we
 
03:13:34.319 --> 03:13:35.429 align:start position:0%
so we can start to identify where we
have

03:13:35.429 --> 03:13:35.439 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:13:37.590 --> 03:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
similar things based on the amendment
 
03:13:38.790 --> 03:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
because i still haven't been through
 
03:13:38.800 --> 03:13:39.590 align:start position:0%
because i still haven't been through
pages

03:13:39.590 --> 03:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
pages
 
03:13:41.590 --> 03:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
most of page one and all page two and
 
03:13:43.910 --> 03:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
three because we zip right to page four
 
03:13:46.309 --> 03:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
so tell me what page you're on and what
 
03:13:47.830 --> 03:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
section you're going to start with for
 
03:13:50.790 --> 03:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:53.910 --> 03:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
sure let's see here i i would
 
03:13:55.830 --> 03:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair if i could just address one
 
03:13:57.510 --> 03:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
point that senator morris made
 
03:13:59.750 --> 03:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
we could could i please understand
 
03:14:01.510 --> 03:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what the differences are between
 
03:14:03.670 --> 03:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
the two things you did not cover it
 
03:14:05.590 --> 03:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
mr ripple does not want to cover it i
 
03:14:07.349 --> 03:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
really would like to understand this
 
03:14:09.110 --> 03:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
document we just passed out before we
 
03:14:11.670 --> 03:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
discuss if you don't mind
 
03:14:13.830 --> 03:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
sure uh senator raleigh stand up um i
 
03:14:17.269 --> 03:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:18.790 --> 03:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
senator bradley if i give you one minute
 
03:14:20.790 --> 03:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
i have to give representative edwards
 
03:14:22.870 --> 03:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
one minute and represent first one man i
 
03:14:24.550 --> 03:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
have to be fair here and i really would
 
03:14:26.070 --> 03:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
like to know what i have if you don't
 
03:14:26.080 --> 03:14:27.510 align:start position:0%
like to know what i have if you don't
mind

03:14:27.510 --> 03:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
mind
 
03:14:30.790 --> 03:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
okay sure i'll be very quick um on page
 
03:14:33.990 --> 03:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
274 on the side by side
 
03:14:35.830 --> 03:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
the statement of findings between the
 
03:14:38.389 --> 03:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
house and the senate house section 358
 
03:14:38.399 --> 03:14:38.710 align:start position:0%
house and the senate house section 358
in

03:14:38.710 --> 03:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:14:41.830 --> 03:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
senate section 326 are identical
 
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
um you'll see on page 274 where the
 
03:14:47.590 --> 03:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
senate had deleted some sections
 
03:14:49.590 --> 03:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
of these sections related to the sununu
 
03:14:51.110 --> 03:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
center and that takes you all the way up
 
03:14:51.990 --> 03:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
to section
 
03:14:57.110 --> 03:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
page 280 which is senate section 327
 
03:14:59.990 --> 03:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
senate section 327 is the appropriation
 
03:15:02.389 --> 03:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
for the operation of the sununu center
 
03:15:05.670 --> 03:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh for the biennium so 10.4 million for
 
03:15:05.680 --> 03:15:06.630 align:start position:0%
uh for the biennium so 10.4 million for
22

03:15:06.630 --> 03:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
22
 
03:15:10.790 --> 03:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
and 9.922 for 23 appropriated to hhs for
 
03:15:12.550 --> 03:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
operation of the suny news center
 
03:15:14.229 --> 03:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
and then the source of funds are
 
03:15:14.239 --> 03:15:15.750 align:start position:0%
and then the source of funds are
identified

03:15:15.750 --> 03:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
identified
 
03:15:17.510 --> 03:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the amendment that was just passed
 
03:15:21.750 --> 03:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
out um amendment 1991
 
03:15:26.550 --> 03:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
h on page four of the amendments
 
03:15:29.830 --> 03:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
section 334 is identical
 
03:15:32.790 --> 03:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
to the uh senate so the same
 
03:15:34.070 --> 03:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation amount
 
03:15:40.309 --> 03:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:43.349 --> 03:15:43.359 align:start position:0%
on the side-by-side section 328 is
 
03:15:45.349 --> 03:15:45.359 align:start position:0%

new youth services center
 
03:16:02.229 --> 03:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
um and the house is prohibiting that as

03:16:06.309 --> 03:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
explained they'll the house on the
 
03:16:06.319 --> 03:16:09.269 align:start position:0%

03:16:19.349 --> 03:16:19.359 align:start position:0%
916 a and c
 
03:16:21.269 --> 03:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
from the effective date of this section
 
03:16:23.110 --> 03:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
which is july 1st until the closure of
 
03:16:24.229 --> 03:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
the sununu center
 
03:16:26.070 --> 03:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
so not the entire biennium but through
 
03:16:27.590 --> 03:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
october 1st 22
 
03:16:29.590 --> 03:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
prior approval of fiscal the general

operation at the center but on october
 
03:16:39.110 --> 03:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
2nd uh 2022 their authority to transfer
 
03:16:39.120 --> 03:16:39.990 align:start position:0%
2nd uh 2022 their authority to transfer
ceases

03:16:39.990 --> 03:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
ceases
 
03:16:41.510 --> 03:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay so the house shortened the
 
03:16:43.349 --> 03:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
authority to transfer this
 
03:16:46.630 --> 03:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
based on the closure correct and then
 
03:16:46.640 --> 03:16:47.110 align:start position:0%
based on the closure correct and then
the

03:16:47.110 --> 03:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:16:50.790 --> 03:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
committee let me just turn real quick
 
03:16:53.830 --> 03:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
if we go to page on the side by side the
 
03:16:56.469 --> 03:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
next section on page 281
 
03:17:00.070 --> 03:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh section 329 is where the senate
 
03:17:01.750 --> 03:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
states the general court finds the
 
03:17:03.030 --> 03:17:03.040 align:start position:0%

shall occur no later than march 1st 2023
 
03:17:17.349 --> 03:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
what the um house is proposing
 
03:17:19.910 --> 03:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
is that that date of the sununu center
 
03:17:22.790 --> 03:17:22.800 align:start position:0%

03:17:22.800 --> 03:17:23.429 align:start position:0%
be closed not on march by march 1st 2023
but

03:17:23.429 --> 03:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:17:25.190 --> 03:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
several months earlier on october 1st
 
03:17:25.200 --> 03:17:26.870 align:start position:0%
several months earlier on october 1st
2022

03:17:26.870 --> 03:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
2022
 
03:17:29.150 --> 03:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
so that's you know in the senate section
 
03:17:29.160 --> 03:17:30.309 align:start position:0%
so that's you know in the senate section
4329

beginning of 281
 
03:17:44.309 --> 03:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
in its place i believe let me just look
 
03:17:46.710 --> 03:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
on amendment 1991
 
03:17:46.720 --> 03:17:52.309 align:start position:0%

03:18:44.389 --> 03:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
if we go back to page five on the
 
03:18:46.389 --> 03:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
amendment in addition to the same

seek the advice of whoever they deem
 
03:19:01.429 --> 03:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
will be helpful
 
03:19:04.309 --> 03:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
um can i ask you to address
 
03:19:05.750 --> 03:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
03:19:09.670 --> 03:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
question which was first came up in 25
 
03:19:11.590 --> 03:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
with the shall be operated by the
 
03:19:13.349 --> 03:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
03:19:13.359 --> 03:19:13.910 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
but

03:19:13.910 --> 03:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:19:17.349 --> 03:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
25 26 30 33
 
03:19:20.710 --> 03:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
35 36 all have shells in them
 
03:19:22.950 --> 03:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
the interesting thing is the senate
 
03:19:24.630 --> 03:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
version has several shells
 
03:19:27.750 --> 03:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
is that the equivalent of must
 
03:19:30.229 --> 03:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
yes so that's must that's what the
 
03:19:31.349 --> 03:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
committee must do
 
03:19:34.469 --> 03:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
correct okay all right please continue
 
03:19:37.830 --> 03:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
um so if we look at the after the
 
03:19:37.840 --> 03:19:39.269 align:start position:0%
um so if we look at the after the
establishment

03:19:39.269 --> 03:19:39.279 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
03:19:41.349 --> 03:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
of the committee on page 281 on roman
 
03:19:42.550 --> 03:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
numeral four
 
03:19:43.990 --> 03:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
committee shall develop a plan for the
 
03:19:45.750 --> 03:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
closure and replacement of the sununu
 
03:19:46.790 --> 03:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
services center
 
03:19:48.309 --> 03:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
including cost estimates for the
 
03:19:49.910 --> 03:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
construction and operation of a new
 
03:19:49.920 --> 03:19:51.510 align:start position:0%
construction and operation of a new
facility

03:19:51.510 --> 03:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:19:53.830 --> 03:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
so that is what the senate is requiring
 
03:19:57.030 --> 03:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:59.670 --> 03:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
the committee for the the representative
 
03:20:01.110 --> 03:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
weiler representative edwards had gone
 
03:20:02.389 --> 03:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
over the committee shell to develop a
 
03:20:04.070 --> 03:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
plan for the closure and replacement
 
03:20:06.070 --> 03:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
or repurposing of the sununu youth
 
03:20:07.349 --> 03:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
services center
 
03:20:09.830 --> 03:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
so instead of the closure and
 
03:20:11.510 --> 03:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
replacement is maintained by the house
 
03:20:13.190 --> 03:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
but they also add the repurposing of the
 
03:20:13.200 --> 03:20:13.590 align:start position:0%
but they also add the repurposing of the
suny

03:20:13.590 --> 03:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
suny
 
03:20:16.150 --> 03:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
youth service center um also including

operation of a new facility
 
03:20:22.070 --> 03:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh which is an extension it's similar to
 
03:20:23.510 --> 03:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
what the
 
03:20:27.030 --> 03:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
senate had as far as the shells
 
03:20:30.229 --> 03:20:30.239 align:start position:0%

and the speaker by november 1st 2021
 
03:21:49.510 --> 03:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
and that would require fiscal committee
 
03:21:49.520 --> 03:21:51.110 align:start position:0%
and that would require fiscal committee
approval

03:21:51.110 --> 03:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
approval
 
03:21:55.030 --> 03:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
if we go back to the house amendment on
 
03:22:00.950 --> 03:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:04.790 --> 03:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
row 25 like the senate it shall be
 
03:22:06.389 --> 03:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
operated by the department of health and
 
03:22:07.990 --> 03:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
human services
 
03:22:11.190 --> 03:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
um separate or different from the senate
 
03:22:12.469 --> 03:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
on line 26
 
03:22:14.070 --> 03:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
it shall be designed to meet the unique
 
03:22:15.830 --> 03:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
needs of up to five youth at a time
 
03:22:16.469 --> 03:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:22:19.030 --> 03:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative edwards had explained
 
03:22:20.630 --> 03:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
and it does go over the various
 
03:22:22.550 --> 03:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh reasons why uh youth would be
 
03:22:23.990 --> 03:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
detained or committed
 
03:22:27.429 --> 03:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
to this facility it shall it does
 
03:22:27.439 --> 03:22:28.150 align:start position:0%
to this facility it shall it does
requirement

03:22:28.150 --> 03:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
03:22:30.229 --> 03:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
separate youth by gender treatment needs
 
03:22:31.990 --> 03:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
and other relevant factors
 
03:22:34.630 --> 03:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
it does uh require like the senate three
 
03:22:36.309 --> 03:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
separate residential spaces and
 
03:22:38.630 --> 03:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate common spaces it does not
 
03:22:38.640 --> 03:22:39.030 align:start position:0%
appropriate common spaces it does not
say

03:22:39.030 --> 03:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:22:42.229 --> 03:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
how many beds each one shall have
 
03:22:44.710 --> 03:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
provide services as the senate does for
 
03:22:46.150 --> 03:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
medical physical behavioral health
 
03:22:48.070 --> 03:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
nutritional educational needs
 
03:22:50.469 --> 03:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
indoor and outdoor recreation
 
03:22:52.309 --> 03:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
architecturally secure as the senate
 
03:22:54.950 --> 03:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
does the big difference on row 37 the
 
03:22:55.590 --> 03:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
opening of
 
03:22:57.269 --> 03:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
replacement facilities shall be no later
 
03:23:01.590 --> 03:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:04.550 --> 03:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
moving over to page six on the amendment
 
03:23:06.070 --> 03:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh the committee shall also
 
03:23:07.830 --> 03:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh will also prepare necessary
 
03:23:09.830 --> 03:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
legislation for the 22
 
03:23:11.750 --> 03:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
legislative session and then it goes
 
03:23:13.750 --> 03:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
over how the chairperson of that
 
03:23:14.950 --> 03:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
committee would be named which is
 
03:23:16.229 --> 03:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
similar to
 
03:23:19.110 --> 03:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
what the senate has a final report also
 
03:23:20.150 --> 03:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
to be issued
 
03:23:23.670 --> 03:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
on november 1st 2021 and require
 
03:23:25.910 --> 03:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
joint fiscal approval as the senate does
 
03:23:25.920 --> 03:23:27.670 align:start position:0%
joint fiscal approval as the senate does
require

03:23:27.670 --> 03:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
require
 
03:23:30.229 --> 03:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr kane okay i know at least
 
03:23:31.670 --> 03:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
four people have had their hands up
 
03:23:34.070 --> 03:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
senator bradley senator moore senator
 
03:23:35.750 --> 03:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative edwards and
 
03:23:37.830 --> 03:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative irf welcome to the table
 
03:23:42.830 --> 03:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
who wants to go first gentlemen you'll
 
03:23:42.840 --> 03:23:45.670 align:start position:0%
who wants to go first gentlemen you'll
wait

03:23:45.670 --> 03:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
wait
 
03:23:47.670 --> 03:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay why don't you go next because
 
03:23:54.550 --> 03:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:57.990 --> 03:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
turn your mic on
 
03:24:02.309 --> 03:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
your mind up and talk into it yes
 
03:24:04.870 --> 03:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
is that laughing on if you press the red
 
03:24:06.550 --> 03:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
one down it's locked and on
 
03:24:10.309 --> 03:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
okay so i agree with
 
03:24:13.269 --> 03:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
much of what uh senator morse was was
 
03:24:14.950 --> 03:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
saying and senator edwards
 
03:24:16.870 --> 03:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
um but i'll note that we've glossed over
 
03:24:18.870 --> 03:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
the probably the most important
 
03:24:22.710 --> 03:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
change to the senate version which was
 
03:24:24.790 --> 03:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
a critical part of the house version
 
03:24:25.990 --> 03:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's actually the first part of the
 
03:24:27.910 --> 03:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
house version as well
 
03:24:32.070 --> 03:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
and that's the 254 uh hb 254 which
 
03:24:33.990 --> 03:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
essentially is now
 
03:24:35.349 --> 03:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
in the start of this amendment and was
 
03:24:38.389 --> 03:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
also in the start of the house
 
03:24:41.830 --> 03:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
version and hb 254
 
03:24:45.990 --> 03:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
is really the linchpin of the system
 
03:24:50.309 --> 03:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
since this is what divides
 
03:24:53.030 --> 03:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
and reduces the the headcount of
 
03:24:55.429 --> 03:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
children that would need to go into
 
03:24:58.469 --> 03:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
a system such as this so it changes
 
03:25:01.510 --> 03:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
the offenses that permit incarceration
 
03:25:05.190 --> 03:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
at the center it only incarcerates
 
03:25:08.710 --> 03:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
serious violent offenders and utilize
 
03:25:09.830 --> 03:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
the system of care
 
03:25:11.910 --> 03:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
that we've all developed or been
 
03:25:13.910 --> 03:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
developing with dhhs
 
03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
for those convicted of lesser offenses
 
03:25:16.319 --> 03:25:17.190 align:start position:0%
for those convicted of lesser offenses
and

03:25:17.190 --> 03:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:25:21.110 --> 03:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:22.469 --> 03:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
if you're looking so there's basically
 
03:25:25.030 --> 03:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
several places where
 
03:25:28.389 --> 03:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
serious def offenses are defined
 
03:25:31.510 --> 03:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
hey this is now in the amendment page
 
03:25:31.520 --> 03:25:32.309 align:start position:0%
hey this is now in the amendment page
two

03:25:32.309 --> 03:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:25:35.590 --> 03:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
in bold lays down
 
03:25:39.590 --> 03:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
a whole series of offenses um
 
03:25:41.990 --> 03:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
currently even there are even some
 
03:25:43.750 --> 03:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor offenses for which you can
 
03:25:44.950 --> 03:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
be incarcerated
 
03:25:47.190 --> 03:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
at the sununu center as well as a number
 
03:25:49.030 --> 03:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
of other lesser offenses not less than a
 
03:25:50.710 --> 03:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor but lesser than
 
03:25:52.469 --> 03:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
very serious offenses that get you
 
03:25:55.110 --> 03:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
incarcerated there
 
03:25:56.950 --> 03:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
so and there's more there's more to that
 
03:25:58.389 --> 03:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
i won't go into all the details of that
 
03:25:59.190 --> 03:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
but there's a
 
03:26:01.030 --> 03:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
whole series i mean so basically that is
 
03:26:02.830 --> 03:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
the first one two
 
03:26:02.840 --> 03:26:05.670 align:start position:0%
the first one two
three

03:26:05.670 --> 03:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:26:08.870 --> 03:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
and almost a half pages that outlines
 
03:26:11.429 --> 03:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
the the process by which we're going to
 
03:26:12.870 --> 03:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
limit the number of
 
03:26:15.910 --> 03:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
children that judges can have the option
 
03:26:15.920 --> 03:26:16.229 align:start position:0%
children that judges can have the option
to

03:26:16.229 --> 03:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:26:19.590 --> 03:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
incarcerate there however because we are
 
03:26:22.550 --> 03:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
making some dramatic changes to the
 
03:26:24.229 --> 03:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
specific offenses
 
03:26:26.389 --> 03:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
we also as representative edwards
 
03:26:28.389 --> 03:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned and this is in
 
03:26:31.510 --> 03:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
the section j starting on line 28 of
 
03:26:33.030 --> 03:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
page two
 
03:26:35.830 --> 03:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
we do allow an out for a judge through a
 
03:26:37.910 --> 03:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
hearing a full hearing full evidentiary
 
03:26:37.920 --> 03:26:38.790 align:start position:0%
hearing a full hearing full evidentiary
hearing

03:26:38.790 --> 03:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:26:41.830 --> 03:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
to make an exception so that somebody
 
03:26:41.840 --> 03:26:42.550 align:start position:0%
to make an exception so that somebody
that's

03:26:42.550 --> 03:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:26:44.229 --> 03:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
that doesn't qualify under the offenses
 
03:26:46.070 --> 03:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
but that a judge feels
 
03:26:48.070 --> 03:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
is appropriate to a center such as
 
03:26:49.990 --> 03:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions such as sununu
 
03:26:53.510 --> 03:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
could go ahead with that so
 
03:26:56.229 --> 03:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
that's the 254 replacement and that is a
 
03:26:58.309 --> 03:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
big part of the improvement to the
 
03:27:00.150 --> 03:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
overall system since it reduces
 
03:27:02.469 --> 03:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
the head count and allows for a smaller
 
03:27:02.479 --> 03:27:03.429 align:start position:0%
the head count and allows for a smaller
facility

03:27:03.429 --> 03:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:27:05.990 --> 03:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
on the one hand on the other hand going
 
03:27:07.429 --> 03:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
to the system of care i think this was
 
03:27:09.030 --> 03:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier by i believe as
 
03:27:10.630 --> 03:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative over pointed out
 
03:27:13.590 --> 03:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
that the senate appropriate
 
03:27:15.429 --> 03:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
approximately 40 million dollars
 
03:27:18.950 --> 03:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
for the behavioral youth pro
 
03:27:21.750 --> 03:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
system of care program which essentially
 
03:27:22.950 --> 03:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
is this
 
03:27:24.550 --> 03:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
the intense ni from what i also
 
03:27:26.070 --> 03:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
understand dhhs is already in the
 
03:27:26.870 --> 03:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
process of
 
03:27:30.550 --> 03:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
letting contracts for these systems
 
03:27:32.630 --> 03:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
which involve intensive care with the
 
03:27:33.750 --> 03:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
action say care
 
03:27:36.229 --> 03:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
intensive handling of individual youth
 
03:27:37.510 --> 03:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
with their family
 
03:27:40.070 --> 03:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
over a three to six month period and all
 
03:27:40.080 --> 03:27:40.710 align:start position:0%
over a three to six month period and all
that

03:27:40.710 --> 03:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:27:44.630 --> 03:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
funding and all that setup in my opinion
 
03:27:46.229 --> 03:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
is intended to handle exactly this kind
 
03:27:48.790 --> 03:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
of situation so you have these children
 
03:27:50.710 --> 03:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
that are not the murderers that can't be
 
03:27:52.469 --> 03:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
helped but rather the kids that we
 
03:27:53.510 --> 03:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
really hope we can
 
03:27:57.030 --> 03:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
reform and bring back into uh
 
03:28:01.030 --> 03:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
society um so that's that's critical to
 
03:28:02.309 --> 03:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
on the one hand it saves us money
 
03:28:03.190 --> 03:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
because we can
 
03:28:04.630 --> 03:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
they can federal match those with
 
03:28:06.389 --> 03:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
children on the other hand it helps the
 
03:28:07.750 --> 03:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
children which is really what this is
 
03:28:09.190 --> 03:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
all about
 
03:28:12.630 --> 03:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
um okay so let me just look at my nose
 
03:28:13.670 --> 03:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry not to
 
03:28:15.510 --> 03:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
can i ask the senate a question while
 
03:28:17.269 --> 03:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
you're looking of course ma'am
 
03:28:20.469 --> 03:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
okay as i understand this house bill 254
 
03:28:22.309 --> 03:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
must have been a second committee bill
 
03:28:25.590 --> 03:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
to house financial went directly to
 
03:28:27.349 --> 03:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
division three without a
 
03:28:29.429 --> 03:28:29.439 align:start position:0%
public hearing in-house finance and has
 
03:28:30.469 --> 03:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
been retained
 
03:28:32.630 --> 03:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
that means it went through probably
 
03:28:35.510 --> 03:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
children and family law chaired by
 
03:28:38.950 --> 03:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative rice has the senate
 
03:28:42.309 --> 03:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to have
 
03:28:45.110 --> 03:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
a public hearing on these provisions
 
03:28:47.590 --> 03:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
that represent earth was talking about
 
03:28:49.750 --> 03:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
found on page two that are bold or is
 
03:28:49.760 --> 03:28:50.630 align:start position:0%
found on page two that are bold or is
this

03:28:50.630 --> 03:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:28:53.830 --> 03:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
language that you guys haven't worked on
 
03:28:56.389 --> 03:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
at all i don't know where we are
 
03:29:00.630 --> 03:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
um so um you're right madam chair
 
03:29:02.469 --> 03:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
this bill to go through children and
 
03:29:04.070 --> 03:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
family law
 
03:29:07.510 --> 03:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh the vote was 14-1 and then it was
 
03:29:10.790 --> 03:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
retained in committee um i
 
03:29:14.550 --> 03:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
find that i i'm
 
03:29:16.870 --> 03:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
not necessarily opposed to the changes
 
03:29:16.880 --> 03:29:17.670 align:start position:0%
not necessarily opposed to the changes
that

03:29:17.670 --> 03:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:29:20.469 --> 03:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh representative earth just outlined
 
03:29:20.479 --> 03:29:21.190 align:start position:0%
uh representative earth just outlined
i've

03:29:21.190 --> 03:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
i've
 
03:29:23.110 --> 03:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
long been a supporter i think i was a
 
03:29:23.120 --> 03:29:24.710 align:start position:0%
long been a supporter i think i was a
co-sponsor

03:29:24.710 --> 03:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor
 
03:29:28.710 --> 03:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
of the system of care bill in
 
03:29:32.469 --> 03:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
the last session it
 
03:29:35.030 --> 03:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
is the way to go there is no question
 
03:29:36.950 --> 03:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
about that in my mind
 
03:29:41.990 --> 03:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:45.429 --> 03:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
we're looking at it um as if it's all
 
03:29:46.150 --> 03:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
03:29:49.990 --> 03:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
smooth and no problem and
 
03:29:53.910 --> 03:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
that we just adjudicate
 
03:29:57.349 --> 03:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
the most serious youth offenses in these
 
03:29:57.359 --> 03:29:58.309 align:start position:0%
the most serious youth offenses in these
changes

03:29:58.309 --> 03:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
changes
 
03:30:01.750 --> 03:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
under house bill 254 we've been down
 
03:30:01.760 --> 03:30:01.990 align:start position:0%
under house bill 254 we've been down
this

03:30:01.990 --> 03:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:30:04.389 --> 03:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
road before unfortunately several years
 
03:30:06.229 --> 03:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
ago with efforts for
 
03:30:09.590 --> 03:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
bail reform and i think
 
03:30:12.790 --> 03:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
that having gone through that and having
 
03:30:17.910 --> 03:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
seen people that should have been
 
03:30:21.349 --> 03:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
retained in custody who are a danger to
 
03:30:24.550 --> 03:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
themselves or a danger to society
 
03:30:28.309 --> 03:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
and being released and
 
03:30:31.590 --> 03:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
reoffending in a violent way
 
03:30:34.630 --> 03:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
concerns me mightily with the provisions
 
03:30:36.150 --> 03:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
03:30:40.229 --> 03:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
that may well be good but need
 
03:30:43.349 --> 03:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
certainly more scrutiny by our side
 
03:30:45.830 --> 03:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
um because it never they never did have
 
03:30:46.790 --> 03:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
a hearing in the
 
03:30:48.870 --> 03:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
in the judiciary committee and senator
 
03:30:51.349 --> 03:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
carson who i would note i believe was
 
03:30:52.550 --> 03:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of
 
03:30:55.750 --> 03:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
254. having said that
 
03:31:01.349 --> 03:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:03.830 --> 03:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're in agreement that the sununu
 
03:31:05.349 --> 03:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
center should be closed
 
03:31:07.910 --> 03:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay we have a slightly different
 
03:31:08.950 --> 03:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
approach than
 
03:31:12.070 --> 03:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
you folks do a little bit more time and
 
03:31:14.150 --> 03:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit more flexibility in terms
 
03:31:15.110 --> 03:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
of the number
 
03:31:19.030 --> 03:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
of kids but i i would go back to when we
 
03:31:19.040 --> 03:31:19.830 align:start position:0%
of kids but i i would go back to when we
first

03:31:19.830 --> 03:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:31:24.229 --> 03:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
i think it was in the 2017 budget when
 
03:31:28.229 --> 03:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
senator carson and i were tasked with
 
03:31:31.269 --> 03:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
working with you folks and division
 
03:31:31.279 --> 03:31:32.070 align:start position:0%
working with you folks and division
three

03:31:32.070 --> 03:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:31:36.309 --> 03:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
on um changes to the sununu center
 
03:31:39.429 --> 03:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
the attendance was 70 kids roughly if i
 
03:31:39.439 --> 03:31:39.990 align:start position:0%
the attendance was 70 kids roughly if i
remember

03:31:39.990 --> 03:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
remember
 
03:31:42.389 --> 03:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
and now the average attendance is about
 
03:31:43.670 --> 03:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
12. so we've made
 
03:31:46.550 --> 03:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
remarkable changes but i want to know
 
03:31:48.309 --> 03:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
before we make the changes
 
03:31:52.469 --> 03:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
in 254 that the system of care is up and
 
03:31:52.479 --> 03:31:53.510 align:start position:0%
in 254 that the system of care is up and
operable

03:31:53.510 --> 03:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
operable
 
03:31:58.070 --> 03:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
that it's diverting the misdemeanor
 
03:32:00.389 --> 03:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
type offenses that you listed that
 
03:32:02.309 --> 03:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
should be diverted into the system of
 
03:32:02.319 --> 03:32:03.269 align:start position:0%
should be diverted into the system of
care

03:32:03.269 --> 03:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:32:05.830 --> 03:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
that they're not going from misdemeanor
 
03:32:08.469 --> 03:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
level offenses to violent offenses
 
03:32:11.190 --> 03:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
that we don't have you know an outbreak
 
03:32:11.200 --> 03:32:11.990 align:start position:0%
that we don't have you know an outbreak
of

03:32:11.990 --> 03:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:32:16.070 --> 03:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
youth crime that we have no um
 
03:32:19.030 --> 03:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to curtail because these
 
03:32:19.830 --> 03:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
things are now
 
03:32:22.550 --> 03:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
in law and having been burned by bail
 
03:32:22.560 --> 03:32:23.190 align:start position:0%
in law and having been burned by bail
reform

03:32:23.190 --> 03:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
reform
 
03:32:27.190 --> 03:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
i i just you know plead
 
03:32:29.910 --> 03:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
let's be cautious let's be careful let's
 
03:32:31.110 --> 03:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
do it right
 
03:32:33.030 --> 03:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
know that we have to close the sununu
 
03:32:34.870 --> 03:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
center but one of the reasons
 
03:32:38.389 --> 03:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
that i advocated for the additional time
 
03:32:40.630 --> 03:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
was so that there was full opportunity
 
03:32:42.550 --> 03:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
to discuss the
 
03:32:44.469 --> 03:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
changes that are being proposed here and
 
03:32:45.910 --> 03:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
make sure we get it right
 
03:32:47.510 --> 03:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't get it right in my opinion on
 
03:32:49.670 --> 03:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
bail reform and we're paying a price for
 
03:32:49.680 --> 03:32:50.229 align:start position:0%
bail reform and we're paying a price for
it

03:32:50.229 --> 03:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:32:53.429 --> 03:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
and god help us if
 
03:32:55.110 --> 03:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
you know some of the violent activity
 
03:32:56.790 --> 03:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
that we've seen in new hampshire from
 
03:32:57.590 --> 03:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
people that got
 
03:33:01.269 --> 03:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
pr bail now become youth being released
 
03:33:03.269 --> 03:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
because we can't detain them
 
03:33:07.269 --> 03:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
i find that to be problematic so i think
 
03:33:10.309 --> 03:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
you know we need to work on this
 
03:33:13.510 --> 03:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
work on it carefully and speed is not
 
03:33:15.030 --> 03:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
always the best issue
 
03:33:17.110 --> 03:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
when trying to work on it carefully so
 
03:33:18.389 --> 03:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:33:21.030 --> 03:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay i think what we ought to do here
 
03:33:21.590 --> 03:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
03:33:23.830 --> 03:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
representative edwards said that when
 
03:33:25.349 --> 03:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
you get something you think about
 
03:33:27.510 --> 03:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
could be some wordsmithing i think we
 
03:33:29.429 --> 03:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
ought to get our comments out here on
 
03:33:30.070 --> 03:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
the table
 
03:33:32.630 --> 03:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
so we all hear them and then we're going
 
03:33:33.990 --> 03:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
to hold this
 
03:33:37.190 --> 03:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
until we meet tomorrow rather than do it
 
03:33:38.870 --> 03:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
now so we have a con
 
03:33:40.870 --> 03:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
think about what do you think about this
 
03:33:42.309 --> 03:33:42.319 align:start position:0%
what do you think about that
 
03:33:45.429 --> 03:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
where do they mesh together so who else
 
03:33:45.439 --> 03:33:45.990 align:start position:0%
where do they mesh together so who else
would

03:33:45.990 --> 03:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:33:49.030 --> 03:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
represent i'm sorry senator rosenwald
 
03:33:50.870 --> 03:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
followed by senator morse
 
03:33:54.070 --> 03:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um i'm just
 
03:33:57.590 --> 03:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
looking at the department's
 
03:34:01.590 --> 03:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
monthly dashboard and for
 
03:34:04.950 --> 03:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
every month of this fiscal year
 
03:34:08.309 --> 03:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
we've had no more than seven
 
03:34:11.750 --> 03:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
committed youth at
 
03:34:15.190 --> 03:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
this sununu center we've had somewhere
 
03:34:15.200 --> 03:34:16.229 align:start position:0%
this sununu center we've had somewhere
between

03:34:16.229 --> 03:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
between
 
03:34:20.150 --> 03:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
four and ten detained youth
 
03:34:24.070 --> 03:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
even with a broader allowance for what
 
03:34:25.429 --> 03:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
03:34:28.469 --> 03:34:28.479 align:start position:0%
charges can get someone
 
03:34:31.830 --> 03:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:34.950 --> 03:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
so personally i think a smaller
 
03:34:37.910 --> 03:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
facility is reasonable i don't know five
 
03:34:37.920 --> 03:34:39.269 align:start position:0%
facility is reasonable i don't know five
is

03:34:39.269 --> 03:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:34:42.790 --> 03:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
right but probably smaller
 
03:34:44.550 --> 03:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
but the other thing i would just mention
 
03:34:46.389 --> 03:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
that in the
 
03:34:49.670 --> 03:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 23 appropriation that's
 
03:34:51.590 --> 03:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
in both the senate version and this
 
03:34:51.600 --> 03:34:52.870 align:start position:0%
in both the senate version and this
amendment

03:34:52.870 --> 03:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:34:56.309 --> 03:34:56.319 align:start position:0%
was based on the sununu center
 
03:34:59.670 --> 03:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
operating for eight months of fiscal
 
03:35:01.750 --> 03:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
year 23
 
03:35:04.309 --> 03:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
and the house you're talking about three
 
03:35:04.319 --> 03:35:05.190 align:start position:0%
and the house you're talking about three
months

03:35:05.190 --> 03:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
months
 
03:35:10.950 --> 03:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
so um maybe
 
03:35:15.269 --> 03:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
we could play around with that
 
03:35:16.630 --> 03:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
maybe there'd be some money for
 
03:35:18.790 --> 03:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
construction out of this
 
03:35:21.670 --> 03:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
9.9 million it could be soon remorse
 
03:35:22.469 --> 03:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
followed by
 
03:35:24.950 --> 03:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative edwards i just i just
 
03:35:27.510 --> 03:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
want to point out a few things one
 
03:35:31.990 --> 03:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
um on page 279 there's an appropriation
 
03:35:34.389 --> 03:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
from the house that's certainly
 
03:35:34.399 --> 03:35:35.590 align:start position:0%
from the house that's certainly
considered

03:35:35.590 --> 03:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
considered
 
03:35:37.590 --> 03:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
you know you close it at the end of 22
 
03:35:37.600 --> 03:35:38.630 align:start position:0%
you know you close it at the end of 22
budget

03:35:38.630 --> 03:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:35:40.710 --> 03:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
you still have all of 23 that you have
 
03:35:42.229 --> 03:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
to deal with issues so you were
 
03:35:44.070 --> 03:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
considering that anyways in the house
 
03:35:44.080 --> 03:35:44.790 align:start position:0%
considering that anyways in the house
phase

03:35:44.790 --> 03:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
phase
 
03:35:49.190 --> 03:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
so having said that i can see where
 
03:35:51.429 --> 03:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
if you take the senate's version and you
 
03:35:52.469 --> 03:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
go to page
 
03:35:56.630 --> 03:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
159 if you go down to line
 
03:35:56.640 --> 03:35:59.670 align:start position:0%
159 if you go down to line
25

03:35:59.670 --> 03:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:01.510 --> 03:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
the committee shall develop a plan for
 
03:36:03.110 --> 03:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
closure replacement of the
 
03:36:05.670 --> 03:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
new youth services center the house's
 
03:36:05.680 --> 03:36:06.550 align:start position:0%
new youth services center the house's
language

03:36:06.550 --> 03:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:36:14.070 --> 03:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:15.830 --> 03:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
the committee shall develop a plan for
 
03:36:18.229 --> 03:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
the closure and placement or repurposing
 
03:36:19.590 --> 03:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
of the similar youth center
 
03:36:21.190 --> 03:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
including cost estimates for
 
03:36:22.870 --> 03:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
construction and operation
 
03:36:25.349 --> 03:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
of the new facility the committee's plan
 
03:36:27.590 --> 03:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
shall consider the following
 
03:36:30.070 --> 03:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
that language i think meets what all of
 
03:36:31.510 --> 03:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
us are trying to do
 
03:36:35.510 --> 03:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
much better so i think the senate if
 
03:36:37.110 --> 03:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
you're drafting something tonight
 
03:36:40.229 --> 03:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
would be amenable to that
 
03:36:45.110 --> 03:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
there was also language on page 160
 
03:36:48.710 --> 03:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
the committee shall issue the final
 
03:36:48.720 --> 03:36:49.670 align:start position:0%
the committee shall issue the final
report

03:36:49.670 --> 03:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
report
 
03:36:53.190 --> 03:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
if you go to page six
 
03:36:57.349 --> 03:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
of the amendment that's being suggested
 
03:37:02.550 --> 03:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
um line number one
 
03:37:04.389 --> 03:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
of what's being suggested the committee
 
03:37:06.469 --> 03:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
shall prepare necessary legislation
 
03:37:08.309 --> 03:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
relative to implementation
 
03:37:13.030 --> 03:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
of the plan developed in paragraph four
 
03:37:15.990 --> 03:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
for the 22 legislative session i don't
 
03:37:17.349 --> 03:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
think that's anything different than
 
03:37:19.429 --> 03:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
what i explained when i first got here
 
03:37:22.790 --> 03:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
so including that in here would be fine
 
03:37:25.269 --> 03:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
taking a step in reverse i think it's
 
03:37:26.229 --> 03:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
the house that's
 
03:37:29.190 --> 03:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
suggested a couple of times in the last
 
03:37:30.070 --> 03:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
two days
 
03:37:32.229 --> 03:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
that if the legislation didn't go
 
03:37:33.670 --> 03:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
through your committee
 
03:37:35.990 --> 03:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
then it should be taken up next year
 
03:37:37.750 --> 03:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
we'd probably suggest the same thing on
 
03:37:39.110 --> 03:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
03:37:41.750 --> 03:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
because we haven't taken up that bill
 
03:37:43.750 --> 03:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
but if we could put those two amendments
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
in here i think it gets to
 
03:37:47.910 --> 03:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
where everybody's trying to get to and i
 
03:37:50.389 --> 03:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
guess my point about march first was
 
03:37:51.830 --> 03:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
we were trying to do the same thing you
 
03:37:53.910 --> 03:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
were trying to do not let it get
 
03:37:57.510 --> 03:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
into another legislature so i just don't
 
03:37:57.520 --> 03:37:58.550 align:start position:0%
into another legislature so i just don't
think

03:37:58.550 --> 03:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:38:00.309 --> 03:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to get it done before march
 
03:38:01.750 --> 03:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
1st but
 
03:38:04.710 --> 03:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
october won't work maybe january 1 works
 
03:38:05.590 --> 03:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
03:38:09.030 --> 03:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
but the reality is
 
03:38:10.550 --> 03:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
that committee that meets the summer
 
03:38:12.790 --> 03:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
could do a lot of the work if we follow
 
03:38:14.229 --> 03:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
what i just said
 
03:38:17.429 --> 03:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
and get it to us in fiscal in november
 
03:38:19.349 --> 03:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
first and then get it to legislation in
 
03:38:19.359 --> 03:38:20.229 align:start position:0%
first and then get it to legislation in
january

03:38:20.229 --> 03:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
january
 
03:38:21.670 --> 03:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
isn't that the point of everything we're
 
03:38:27.269 --> 03:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
03:38:28.870 --> 03:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative edwards you also want to
 
03:38:30.790 --> 03:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
speak it's become
 
03:38:33.510 --> 03:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
overcome by events representative morris
 
03:38:35.030 --> 03:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
has recognized
 
03:38:37.590 --> 03:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me senator morris has recognized
 
03:38:38.950 --> 03:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
that in the second year
 
03:38:41.189 --> 03:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
our appropriations were in hb2 there
 
03:38:42.550 --> 03:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
were three sections there with
 
03:38:44.070 --> 03:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
appropriations to
 
03:38:47.189 --> 03:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
handle the closure we put it into hb2
 
03:38:48.950 --> 03:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
because we thought those were one-time
 
03:38:50.550 --> 03:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
expenses and not
 
03:38:52.790 --> 03:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
the operating side so it's just a
 
03:38:54.229 --> 03:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
different approach
 
03:38:57.910 --> 03:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
and and we i your numbers are are good
 
03:39:00.309 --> 03:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
we can go with your numbers
 
03:39:01.830 --> 03:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
i think if we could make those two
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
changes to be honest with you because we
 
03:39:05.189 --> 03:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
agree with you
 
03:39:07.670 --> 03:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
that the committee's gonna here's the
 
03:39:07.680 --> 03:39:08.870 align:start position:0%
that the committee's gonna here's the
guidelines

03:39:08.870 --> 03:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
03:39:11.110 --> 03:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
we want you to come with legislation in
 
03:39:11.120 --> 03:39:11.910 align:start position:0%
we want you to come with legislation in
january

03:39:11.910 --> 03:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
january
 
03:39:14.710 --> 03:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
you have to report out november i think
 
03:39:15.510 --> 03:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
those are
 
03:39:17.510 --> 03:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
two amendments the senate could accept
 
03:39:19.910 --> 03:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
from your language
 
03:39:22.710 --> 03:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
so so division three has uh on this
 
03:39:22.720 --> 03:39:23.269 align:start position:0%
so so division three has uh on this
issue

03:39:23.269 --> 03:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:39:25.990 --> 03:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh we've been led uh by representative
 
03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:26.550 align:start position:0%
uh we've been led uh by representative
weiler

03:39:26.550 --> 03:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
weiler
 
03:39:28.630 --> 03:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
and uh representative walner if they
 
03:39:30.550 --> 03:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
have uh comments i
 
03:39:33.269 --> 03:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
i i like what you're saying but uh i'd
 
03:39:34.790 --> 03:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
like to get them involved if we can
 
03:39:37.189 --> 03:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
madam chair representative walner i know
 
03:39:38.790 --> 03:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
that representative erful
 
03:39:40.550 --> 03:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
yield a chair to you if you'd like to
 
03:39:42.950 --> 03:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
step up to make some comments
 
03:39:44.469 --> 03:39:44.479 align:start position:0%
i think we're trying to move to a place
 
03:39:46.389 --> 03:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
where we could get an amendment
 
03:39:48.870 --> 03:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
and try to get something done tomorrow
 
03:39:48.880 --> 03:39:50.389 align:start position:0%
and try to get something done tomorrow
so

03:39:50.389 --> 03:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:52.229 --> 03:39:52.239 align:start position:0%
working on this together is the way to
 
03:39:52.239 --> 03:39:57.110 align:start position:0%
working on this together is the way to
go

03:39:57.110 --> 03:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:59.990 --> 03:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
while she's moving up my one concern
 
03:40:01.510 --> 03:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
both the senate and the house want to
 
03:40:03.429 --> 03:40:03.439 align:start position:0%
have three separate areas
 
03:40:05.510 --> 03:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know how you divide five beds
 
03:40:07.750 --> 03:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
into three separate areas
 
03:40:10.070 --> 03:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
but i'm just because i have a simple
 
03:40:13.030 --> 03:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
mind with simple math i can do six and
 
03:40:15.750 --> 03:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
two bits in each of the three areas gets
 
03:40:16.550 --> 03:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
me to six
 
03:40:20.309 --> 03:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
but it's just me okay
 
03:40:22.150 --> 03:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative walner representative
 
03:40:27.269 --> 03:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:31.349 --> 03:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh representative ober
 
03:40:34.950 --> 03:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
um i guess on the number i think
 
03:40:37.189 --> 03:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
would be interesting to talk with the
 
03:40:39.110 --> 03:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
senate for us to talk me with the senate
 
03:40:40.790 --> 03:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
about coming together
 
03:40:44.150 --> 03:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
on a number that seems to work um i
 
03:40:44.160 --> 03:40:44.710 align:start position:0%
on a number that seems to work um i
would

03:40:44.710 --> 03:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:40:47.030 --> 03:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
be more than willing to to have that
 
03:40:47.040 --> 03:40:48.469 align:start position:0%
be more than willing to to have that
conversation

03:40:48.469 --> 03:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
03:40:51.590 --> 03:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
i do think that 254 is really
 
03:40:55.590 --> 03:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
important um and i also think that
 
03:40:58.790 --> 03:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
allowing for the judicial override that
 
03:41:00.309 --> 03:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
we've included in
 
03:41:03.269 --> 03:41:03.279 align:start position:0%
the house amendment makes a lot of sense
 
03:41:05.910 --> 03:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
so that if there is a child
 
03:41:09.990 --> 03:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
that um does not fit within the 254
 
03:41:13.590 --> 03:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
guidelines but does need that level of
 
03:41:13.600 --> 03:41:14.710 align:start position:0%
guidelines but does need that level of
care

03:41:14.710 --> 03:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:41:16.630 --> 03:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
that the opportunity would be there for
 
03:41:18.229 --> 03:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
a judge to have
 
03:41:21.990 --> 03:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
that child incarcerated at the new
 
03:41:25.750 --> 03:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
at the new facility and that's
 
03:41:30.229 --> 03:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
really where i am um thank you
 
03:41:34.550 --> 03:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:36.710 --> 03:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh i'd be happy to
 
03:41:38.790 --> 03:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
make the changes that uh
 
03:41:40.950 --> 03:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
senator morris mentioned just you said
 
03:41:42.870 --> 03:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
two changes go over them briefly again
 
03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
please so
 
03:41:46.070 --> 03:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
i'll be ready to make the changes i
 
03:41:47.670 --> 03:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
think just so that
 
03:41:51.269 --> 03:41:51.279 align:start position:0%
the chair realizes the house
 
03:41:54.790 --> 03:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
language allows you to change the number
 
03:41:57.030 --> 03:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
of beds to whatever because the house
 
03:41:59.189 --> 03:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
language says the committee
 
03:42:01.990 --> 03:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
shall develop a plan for closure and
 
03:42:02.000 --> 03:42:02.950 align:start position:0%
shall develop a plan for closure and
replacement

03:42:02.950 --> 03:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
03:42:05.189 --> 03:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
or repurposing of the sununu youth
 
03:42:06.870 --> 03:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
center including cost
 
03:42:09.189 --> 03:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
estimates for construction and operation
 
03:42:11.110 --> 03:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
of a new facility
 
03:42:15.189 --> 03:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
the committee's plan shall consider
 
03:42:18.150 --> 03:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
so you you basically left you can drive
 
03:42:20.950 --> 03:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
a freight train through that one
 
03:42:23.110 --> 03:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
and then the other language that i would
 
03:42:23.990 --> 03:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
put at the end
 
03:42:27.269 --> 03:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
is the committee shall report shall
 
03:42:29.750 --> 03:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
prepare necessary legislation relative
 
03:42:32.389 --> 03:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
to the implementation of the plan
 
03:42:35.590 --> 03:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
developed i think we're all in agreement
 
03:42:36.150 --> 03:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
on that
 
03:42:39.910 --> 03:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
i i so i don't think it stifles anything
 
03:42:43.189 --> 03:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
except for like 254
 
03:42:45.189 --> 03:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
in the sense that the senate's just
 
03:42:46.790 --> 03:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
asking for the same thing the house has
 
03:42:48.550 --> 03:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
been asking for all day
 
03:42:51.510 --> 03:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
that we put that through a committee and
 
03:42:53.189 --> 03:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it's going to get fast-tracked
 
03:42:53.199 --> 03:42:54.309 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it's going to get fast-tracked
because

03:42:54.309 --> 03:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:42:56.070 --> 03:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
and and fast-tracked i mean everybody in
 
03:42:57.429 --> 03:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
the audience is going to have to learn
 
03:42:58.790 --> 03:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
to agree that whatever
 
03:43:00.630 --> 03:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
senate in the house comes because they
 
03:43:02.790 --> 03:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
all have different opinions
 
03:43:06.309 --> 03:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
so i think the fact is the senate's
 
03:43:08.710 --> 03:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
on the same course as the house that we
 
03:43:10.790 --> 03:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
want to get something done here
 
03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that's the problem um
 
03:43:15.830 --> 03:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
and for the purple people that wanted to
 
03:43:17.349 --> 03:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
close this place
 
03:43:19.750 --> 03:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
we agree but we just got to figure out a
 
03:43:21.269 --> 03:43:21.279 align:start position:0%
way to operate
 
03:43:22.550 --> 03:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
did you want me to tighten up the
 
03:43:24.870 --> 03:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
language of what the committee can
 
03:43:27.269 --> 03:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
suggest or i thought adding your two
 
03:43:28.870 --> 03:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
pieces are fine
 
03:43:31.189 --> 03:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
okay yeah i think you add it to what
 
03:43:32.309 --> 03:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
exists right now
 
03:43:34.070 --> 03:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
and yeah it gets to where you guys want
 
03:43:35.910 --> 03:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
to get to um
 
03:43:38.150 --> 03:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
if we can get it done earlier i'm sure
 
03:43:39.990 --> 03:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
this committee of five can figure that
 
03:43:40.000 --> 03:43:40.870 align:start position:0%
this committee of five can figure that
out

03:43:40.870 --> 03:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:43:43.590 --> 03:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
we will so i think i heard you say
 
03:43:44.950 --> 03:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
senator morris that
 
03:43:47.990 --> 03:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
the senate would like to for the purpose
 
03:43:50.950 --> 03:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
of this amendment moving forward in hb2
 
03:43:52.070 --> 03:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
remove the
 
03:43:56.070 --> 03:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
the pieces that chan that are in
 
03:43:59.990 --> 03:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 254 that deal with the legal
 
03:44:02.309 --> 03:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
changes do i have that right not sure i
 
03:44:02.319 --> 03:44:02.790 align:start position:0%
changes do i have that right not sure i
think

03:44:02.790 --> 03:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:44:06.229 --> 03:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
you'd be making a mistake trying to
 
03:44:08.309 --> 03:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
do it that way i think you could
 
03:44:10.309 --> 03:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
instruct lba
 
03:44:12.469 --> 03:44:12.479 align:start position:0%
to take what's in the budget right now
 
03:44:15.429 --> 03:44:15.439 align:start position:0%
and put the house's positions
 
03:44:19.110 --> 03:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
two areas into the budget
 
03:44:21.269 --> 03:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
and the senate would accept those
 
03:44:22.550 --> 03:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
friendly amendments
 
03:44:24.550 --> 03:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
mr cain does that make wonderful sense
 
03:44:25.670 --> 03:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
to you
 
03:44:27.910 --> 03:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
since you're the lba and you will be
 
03:44:30.550 --> 03:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
directing the work on that
 
03:44:32.229 --> 03:44:32.239 align:start position:0%
yes and so we would be making an
 
03:44:34.389 --> 03:44:34.399 align:start position:0%
amendment to the current senate sections
 
03:44:36.710 --> 03:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
as they exist in house bill 2 to include
 
03:44:39.349 --> 03:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
the repurposing provision as well as the
 
03:44:42.550 --> 03:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
um shall consider provision that kind of
 
03:44:45.189 --> 03:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
leaves it open to the committee
 
03:44:48.229 --> 03:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
to the house members who are working on
 
03:44:48.239 --> 03:44:49.110 align:start position:0%
to the house members who are working on
this

03:44:49.110 --> 03:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:44:51.830 --> 03:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
we have representative edwards walner
 
03:44:53.590 --> 03:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
and wyler
 
03:44:56.229 --> 03:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
are you understanding what he just said
 
03:44:58.070 --> 03:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
so we're in agreement so we get one
 
03:45:00.229 --> 03:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
amendment and it's right tomorrow
 
03:45:01.830 --> 03:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
that's where i'm trying to go i want to
 
03:45:03.990 --> 03:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
get this done i want everybody to be
 
03:45:04.000 --> 03:45:05.189 align:start position:0%
get this done i want everybody to be
happy

03:45:05.189 --> 03:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
happy
 
03:45:08.790 --> 03:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
if possible representative edwards
 
03:45:12.389 --> 03:45:12.399 align:start position:0%
a small comment a large yes
 
03:45:14.630 --> 03:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
i i understand i support what you're
 
03:45:15.429 --> 03:45:15.439 align:start position:0%
doing with the
 
03:45:17.510 --> 03:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
senator morris i would just point out
 
03:45:18.469 --> 03:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
that on
 
03:45:21.830 --> 03:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
page five line 25
 
03:45:23.910 --> 03:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
if you start to bring that language over
 
03:45:25.269 --> 03:45:25.279 align:start position:0%
mr kane
 
03:45:28.870 --> 03:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
um it's got a another shall
 
03:45:31.990 --> 03:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
where the word may on uh
 
03:45:34.389 --> 03:45:34.399 align:start position:0%
line 25 ought to be so that there's no
 
03:45:34.399 --> 03:45:35.030 align:start position:0%
line 25 ought to be so that there's no
con

03:45:35.030 --> 03:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
con
 
03:45:37.349 --> 03:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
confusion between what our shallows and
 
03:45:40.630 --> 03:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
our considerations
 
03:45:42.790 --> 03:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
that's why i said earlier represent
 
03:45:45.429 --> 03:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
walnut where are you
 
03:45:47.510 --> 03:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
i've been looking to the three of you i
 
03:45:56.070 --> 03:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:59.349 --> 03:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
well i i still think that 254
 
03:46:02.469 --> 03:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
is what makes this work or not work
 
03:46:02.479 --> 03:46:05.590 align:start position:0%
is what makes this work or not work
um

03:46:05.590 --> 03:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:08.229 --> 03:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
i guess i i need more time to to really
 
03:46:09.349 --> 03:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
think however
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
the division three has retained 254.
 
03:46:16.469 --> 03:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
you could work on that piece fast track
 
03:46:20.070 --> 03:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
it out in january to the senate
 
03:46:22.870 --> 03:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
right am i correct you've retained that
 
03:46:22.880 --> 03:46:23.269 align:start position:0%
right am i correct you've retained that
right

03:46:23.269 --> 03:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:46:26.550 --> 03:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
we've retained that and i i i i i if
 
03:46:28.389 --> 03:46:28.399 align:start position:0%
somebody were more creative and we could
 
03:46:29.189 --> 03:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
add it to
 
03:46:31.429 --> 03:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
the calendar on the 24th if we could
 
03:46:33.110 --> 03:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
vote it out of the house and
 
03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
give it to the senate is that yeah i've
 
03:46:36.229 --> 03:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
talked to the speaker i think we would
 
03:46:38.229 --> 03:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
take two-thirds vote to change the rules
 
03:46:39.349 --> 03:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
or something all right
 
03:46:42.550 --> 03:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
i'm just thinking i'm not sure
 
03:46:45.910 --> 03:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
most of it's right in this amendment
 
03:46:49.110 --> 03:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
i i think out of courtesy though i mean
 
03:46:51.030 --> 03:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
the senate's not going to consider that
 
03:46:53.670 --> 03:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
position in the budget
 
03:46:56.469 --> 03:46:56.479 align:start position:0%
that's that's doing something far beyond
 
03:46:58.469 --> 03:46:58.479 align:start position:0%
where we are today in the budget
 
03:46:59.910 --> 03:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
i don't understand which position you
 
03:47:02.150 --> 03:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
use the 254 which is the language you
 
03:47:04.630 --> 03:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
put in your amendment up front okay um
 
03:47:08.950 --> 03:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
i i just out of courtesy i think
 
03:47:11.429 --> 03:47:11.439 align:start position:0%
we go into january and have that debate
 
03:47:13.429 --> 03:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
so so i understand your position center
 
03:47:14.870 --> 03:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
more so
 
03:47:16.630 --> 03:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
you've not had a chance to hear it it
 
03:47:18.710 --> 03:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
makes a radical change to policy
 
03:47:20.229 --> 03:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
your committee needs to hear it and
 
03:47:21.750 --> 03:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
we've kept it in the house even though
 
03:47:22.550 --> 03:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
we've passed it
 
03:47:26.710 --> 03:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
it makes sense senator rosenwald
 
03:47:30.790 --> 03:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank you i just i'm a little confused
 
03:47:33.510 --> 03:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
because it seems like the senate
 
03:47:33.520 --> 03:47:35.189 align:start position:0%
because it seems like the senate
position

03:47:35.189 --> 03:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:47:39.429 --> 03:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
has been up to 18 children
 
03:47:41.990 --> 03:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
closed on march 1st and we'd be putting
 
03:47:43.590 --> 03:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
in this committee
 
03:47:46.790 --> 03:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's calling for a facility of five
 
03:47:50.469 --> 03:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
no we would that's open on october 1st
 
03:47:52.630 --> 03:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
we take the senate language that exists
 
03:47:52.640 --> 03:47:53.429 align:start position:0%
we take the senate language that exists
today

03:47:53.429 --> 03:47:53.439 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:47:55.750 --> 03:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
and we give them what the house has
 
03:47:57.030 --> 03:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
asked for
 
03:47:59.269 --> 03:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
that these are just guidelines they're
 
03:48:01.269 --> 03:48:01.279 align:start position:0%
not what you have to do
 
03:48:04.070 --> 03:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
so if the five-member committee meets
 
03:48:05.189 --> 03:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
and the five-minute
 
03:48:07.830 --> 03:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
member committee decides that just in
 
03:48:09.269 --> 03:48:09.279 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the state to
 
03:48:09.279 --> 03:48:10.870 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the state to
develop

03:48:10.870 --> 03:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
develop
 
03:48:13.750 --> 03:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
five coincidental then that's what we'd
 
03:48:14.550 --> 03:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
be doing
 
03:48:17.429 --> 03:48:17.439 align:start position:0%
i i we're not restricting the committee
 
03:48:18.790 --> 03:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
from doing
 
03:48:21.750 --> 03:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
anything um i suppose they ought to know
 
03:48:23.590 --> 03:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
eighteen's as big as anyone
 
03:48:26.630 --> 03:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
would accept but um
 
03:48:29.670 --> 03:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot going on here i
 
03:48:31.910 --> 03:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
i think i i've been working through this
 
03:48:34.870 --> 03:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
with people like skivy since 2011 when i
 
03:48:35.910 --> 03:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
got back here
 
03:48:38.710 --> 03:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
so for us to get to where we are today
 
03:48:41.590 --> 03:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
this is a home run to close the place
 
03:48:44.550 --> 03:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
so i i think we're okay we're debating
 
03:48:47.830 --> 03:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:49.590 --> 03:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
and you're gonna step away but you can
 
03:48:51.830 --> 03:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
live with that
 
03:48:56.150 --> 03:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank you for coming forward
 
03:48:58.950 --> 03:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
all right mr kane i think we have
 
03:48:58.960 --> 03:49:00.550 align:start position:0%
all right mr kane i think we have
actually

03:49:00.550 --> 03:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:49:04.070 --> 03:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
arrived at a an agreement
 
03:49:05.910 --> 03:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
between the house and the senate on
 
03:49:08.389 --> 03:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
another amendment that will be a hybrid
 
03:49:11.590 --> 03:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
of both bodies work
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:19.269 --> 03:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
and you can make that happen kevin um
 
03:49:21.189 --> 03:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
we'll look at these changes uh we'll
 
03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
also send
 
03:49:26.550 --> 03:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:28.790 --> 03:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
oh okay um we'll come up with a draft
 
03:49:29.670 --> 03:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to share with
 
03:49:32.389 --> 03:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
all of you just to ensure that we're
 
03:49:34.070 --> 03:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
moving in the right direction
 
03:49:37.110 --> 03:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay excellent
 
03:49:39.429 --> 03:49:39.439 align:start position:0%

03:50:04.710 --> 03:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:06.550 --> 03:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
do we have any other amendments that we
 
03:50:07.830 --> 03:50:07.840 align:start position:0%

03:50:10.389 --> 03:50:10.399 align:start position:0%

amendments as we've gone along
 
03:50:25.189 --> 03:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:46.309 --> 03:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:50.070 --> 03:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
okay mr king we've gone to page one of
 
03:50:50.080 --> 03:50:50.550 align:start position:0%
okay mr king we've gone to page one of
our

03:50:50.550 --> 03:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:50:53.990 --> 03:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
summaries side by side comparison
 
03:50:57.670 --> 03:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
and basically we have section 16 and 16
 
03:51:00.870 --> 03:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
a senate pass the senate is going to
 
03:51:02.630 --> 03:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
exceed to the house is that correct
 
03:51:02.640 --> 03:51:03.189 align:start position:0%
exceed to the house is that correct
gentlemen

03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
and lady they do it quietly yes they can
 
03:51:07.830 --> 03:51:07.840 align:start position:0%

03:51:33.110 --> 03:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:37.670 --> 03:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:43.030 --> 03:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:52.469 --> 03:51:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:57.110 --> 03:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
senate section 297 to 300.
 
03:51:57.120 --> 03:52:02.790 align:start position:0%
senate section 297 to 300.

03:52:04.870 --> 03:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
and i think we've reached a point where
 
03:52:06.150 --> 03:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
we've done what we can
 
03:52:06.160 --> 03:52:09.910 align:start position:0%

senate

03:52:32.389 --> 03:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
senate
 
03:52:35.110 --> 03:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
is not gonna proceed to any position on
 
03:52:36.710 --> 03:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
the community college system in the
 
03:52:39.830 --> 03:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
university system
 
03:52:42.070 --> 03:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
we've uh had this discussion for a month
 
03:52:42.080 --> 03:52:42.870 align:start position:0%
we've uh had this discussion for a month
now

03:52:42.870 --> 03:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:52:46.229 --> 03:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
and i i can't see the senate
 
03:52:48.469 --> 03:52:48.479 align:start position:0%
looking at anything we're just gonna
 
03:52:50.070 --> 03:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
make that happen
 
03:52:53.429 --> 03:52:53.439 align:start position:0%
before january when we file legislation
 
03:52:53.439 --> 03:52:54.229 align:start position:0%
before january when we file legislation
to

03:52:54.229 --> 03:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:52:57.269 --> 03:52:57.279 align:start position:0%
move forward with something but
 
03:53:01.429 --> 03:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
okay i there that leaves
 
03:53:03.590 --> 03:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
probably two or three major issues
 
03:53:06.389 --> 03:53:06.399 align:start position:0%
between the senate and the house
 
03:53:08.630 --> 03:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
that i think we have to come back on
 
03:53:08.640 --> 03:53:09.429 align:start position:0%
that i think we have to come back on
tomorrow

03:53:09.429 --> 03:53:09.439 align:start position:0%

family leave act that we need to talk
about

03:53:21.510 --> 03:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:23.590 --> 03:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
where if if you look at the summary
 
03:53:26.710 --> 03:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
side-by-side comparison on page five
 
03:53:31.189 --> 03:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
we're looking at house pass sections 117
 
03:53:31.199 --> 03:53:31.830 align:start position:0%
we're looking at house pass sections 117
118

03:53:31.830 --> 03:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
118
 
03:53:34.710 --> 03:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
119. i know representative umberger has
 
03:53:35.990 --> 03:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
already been talking about
 
03:53:39.030 --> 03:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
filing legislation for that in the fall
 
03:53:41.910 --> 03:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
the senate did not put anything in there
 
03:53:43.590 --> 03:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
it's on hold
 
03:53:46.150 --> 03:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
and they will not exceed is the house
 
03:53:48.150 --> 03:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
ready to accede to
 
03:53:54.070 --> 03:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:56.229 --> 03:53:56.239 align:start position:0%

03:54:40.710 --> 03:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
we don't have that
 
03:54:42.469 --> 03:54:42.479 align:start position:0%
language it's not something we can even
 
03:54:44.469 --> 03:54:44.479 align:start position:0%
discuss today senator morris
 
03:54:47.110 --> 03:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
no but i would like to speak to that
 
03:54:47.120 --> 03:54:47.830 align:start position:0%
no but i would like to speak to that
because

03:54:47.830 --> 03:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:54:51.670 --> 03:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
i i want to be clear i i have worked
 
03:54:54.950 --> 03:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
with house members the governor
 
03:54:57.990 --> 03:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
and one senate member that
 
03:55:01.110 --> 03:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
has tried to find agreement on
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
the issues in 417. i've served in this
 
03:55:06.710 --> 03:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
body now
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
for almost 20 years
 
03:55:12.150 --> 03:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
and compromise is the only way we're
 
03:55:14.229 --> 03:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
going to get things i will not vote
 
03:55:14.239 --> 03:55:15.189 align:start position:0%
going to get things i will not vote
tomorrow

03:55:15.189 --> 03:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
03:55:17.030 --> 03:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
to put in the budget anything the
 
03:55:18.870 --> 03:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
governor won't accept
 
03:55:20.870 --> 03:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
so i want to make it clear that the
 
03:55:22.710 --> 03:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
senate's not headed there
 
03:55:25.110 --> 03:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
so if there's something that can come
 
03:55:25.120 --> 03:55:25.750 align:start position:0%
so if there's something that can come
tonight

03:55:25.750 --> 03:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
tonight
 
03:55:28.070 --> 03:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
or tomorrow morning from the 417
 
03:55:28.080 --> 03:55:28.950 align:start position:0%
or tomorrow morning from the 417
committee

03:55:28.950 --> 03:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:55:31.349 --> 03:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
that the governor will accept i'll
 
03:55:32.309 --> 03:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
support it
 
03:55:34.870 --> 03:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
but i am not going to put something when
 
03:55:34.880 --> 03:55:35.590 align:start position:0%
but i am not going to put something when
there's

03:55:35.590 --> 03:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:55:39.189 --> 03:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
basically three bodies to get to speak
 
03:55:43.269 --> 03:55:43.279 align:start position:0%
in the budget um that we can't agree on
 
03:55:45.030 --> 03:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
because that's just not the right way to
 
03:55:47.030 --> 03:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
do it let them send 417 to the
 
03:55:48.389 --> 03:55:48.399 align:start position:0%
governor's desk
 
03:55:50.630 --> 03:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
and if the language doesn't work for the
 
03:55:52.150 --> 03:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
governor he can veto it
 
03:55:54.790 --> 03:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
i was all along it was my goal to put it
 
03:55:56.630 --> 03:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
03:55:59.590 --> 03:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
they are now facing two amendments one
 
03:56:01.349 --> 03:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
that's acceptable to the governor
 
03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
and one that he's made clear isn't
 
03:56:03.359 --> 03:56:05.349 align:start position:0%
and one that he's made clear isn't
acceptable

03:56:05.349 --> 03:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
03:56:06.950 --> 03:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
this has been a challenging time in the
 
03:56:08.870 --> 03:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire i probably
 
03:56:10.710 --> 03:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
debated the governor more than anyone in
 
03:56:11.830 --> 03:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
this room
 
03:56:14.229 --> 03:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
on how we've handled things in the state
 
03:56:16.550 --> 03:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire but he's the governor
 
03:56:19.990 --> 03:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
and the reality is when we were done
 
03:56:22.870 --> 03:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
i worked with him and i don't think we
 
03:56:24.150 --> 03:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
should do anything different
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
in closing this budget and we never have
 
03:56:28.070 --> 03:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
03:56:30.710 --> 03:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
because since the day i was put on as
 
03:56:32.309 --> 03:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
finance chair which was the first time
 
03:56:33.910 --> 03:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
that i ever served on a finance
 
03:56:33.920 --> 03:56:34.950 align:start position:0%
that i ever served on a finance
committee

03:56:34.950 --> 03:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:56:37.750 --> 03:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
till today that i sat on a finance
 
03:56:37.760 --> 03:56:38.630 align:start position:0%
till today that i sat on a finance
committee

03:56:38.630 --> 03:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:56:41.910 --> 03:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
i said to lynn ober i was in there with
 
03:56:44.070 --> 03:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
kirk more times than we've ever been
 
03:56:47.189 --> 03:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
this time and we were slamming heads
 
03:56:49.030 --> 03:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
until 12 o'clock at night
 
03:56:50.870 --> 03:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
to get an agreement between all the
 
03:56:52.229 --> 03:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
bodies and
 
03:56:55.110 --> 03:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
we always did it so to walk away from
 
03:56:56.790 --> 03:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
getting an agreement between
 
03:56:59.189 --> 03:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
everyone is the wrong answer in my
 
03:56:59.199 --> 03:57:00.550 align:start position:0%
everyone is the wrong answer in my
opinion

03:57:00.550 --> 03:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
03:57:02.070 --> 03:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
i'll be back here tomorrow at one
 
03:57:03.750 --> 03:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
o'clock it's
 
03:57:05.189 --> 03:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
certainly going to be something that
 
03:57:07.910 --> 03:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
i'll go watch tomorrow morning
 
03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
at the committee level because i believe
 
03:57:12.469 --> 03:57:12.479 align:start position:0%
that's when 417 is meeting but
 
03:57:14.550 --> 03:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not it goes in the budget it
 
03:57:16.550 --> 03:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
has to be acceptable to the speaker the
 
03:57:17.750 --> 03:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
senate president
 
03:57:20.870 --> 03:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
and our bodies and also to the governor
 
03:57:23.030 --> 03:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
and i i won't vote to do anything
 
03:57:23.040 --> 03:57:27.670 align:start position:0%
and i i won't vote to do anything
different

03:57:27.670 --> 03:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:29.670 --> 03:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
and i will tell you we have not been
 
03:57:31.269 --> 03:57:31.279 align:start position:0%
beating heads together
 
03:57:33.110 --> 03:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
the house and the senate were in
 
03:57:34.790 --> 03:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
agreement on more
 
03:57:37.910 --> 03:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
in hb2 this time than i have ever seen
 
03:57:39.830 --> 03:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
we work very closely together we're
 
03:57:41.990 --> 03:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to continue to do that mr kane i
 
03:57:43.910 --> 03:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
think i've made another mistake
 
03:57:45.910 --> 03:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
if you turn to page five of that
 
03:57:48.710 --> 03:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
side-by-side comparison i think when we
 
03:57:48.720 --> 03:57:49.189 align:start position:0%
side-by-side comparison i think when we
did

03:57:49.189 --> 03:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
did
 
03:57:52.309 --> 03:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
sections 117 118 119
 
03:57:54.469 --> 03:57:54.479 align:start position:0%
i should have included 120 is that
 
03:57:54.479 --> 03:57:55.349 align:start position:0%
i should have included 120 is that
correct

03:57:55.349 --> 03:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:57:57.110 --> 03:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh yes we assumed you included in that
 
03:57:59.110 --> 03:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
sense of reference doing that for me
 
03:58:00.710 --> 03:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
since i didn't say it
 
03:58:02.950 --> 03:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
covering up for me as always i
 
03:58:05.189 --> 03:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate it mr kane
 
03:58:08.790 --> 03:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
all right we are now going to be
 
03:58:11.349 --> 03:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
