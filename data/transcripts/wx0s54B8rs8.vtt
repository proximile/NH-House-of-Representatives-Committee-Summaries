00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative bernstein is a clerk he's
 
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
out today
 
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative lang is going to take
 
00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 align:start position:0%
over his court
 
00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
he asked to
 
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
delay this for about five minutes
 
00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
because he has to
 
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
present a bill and finance and he'll be
 
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
back by five after ten so we're going to
 
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're in trouble if we don't
 
00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's a good
 
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
that's a good question but the first
 
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
thing we're going to deal with is house
 
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 align:start position:0%

no is that it
 
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 align:start position:0%

00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
and we have an amendment that was put
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
together jointly by
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative aaron and representative

schomberg
and

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.750 align:start position:0%
 
whether

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
representative aaron or schomburg
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
okay represent aaron you want to explain
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair sorry i got to get
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
myself together here
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative schomburg brought an
 
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
amendment last time we met and so did i
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
and we just took those two amendments
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
and put them together
 
00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:01.519 align:start position:0%
to have a complete amendment to the
 
00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:02.389 align:start position:0%
to have a complete amendment to the
uh

00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
bill hb 1584
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
which would provide a um
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
a capital improvement program for this
 
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
the state fairs or agricultural affairs
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.190 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
and

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
basically you know we are making a
 
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
statement that it's in the public
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
interest to
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
advance encourage and protect
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
agricultural affairs including the
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
exhibition of livestock and agricultural
 
00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
produce of all kinds
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
and with these fair exhibitions as they
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
need funds to help them
 
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
maintain and upkeep their
 
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.389 align:start position:0%
maintain and upkeep their
infrastructure

00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
the barns the buildings
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
that need maintenance
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
we feel that it's important to have the
 
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.750 align:start position:0%
we feel that it's important to have the
state

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
establish a fund that the commissioner
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
of agriculture would
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
sort of have
 
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
control over that
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
to to distribute these funds
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
fairs and
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
in the places that are in need of
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
infrastructure repairs
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
we have the definitions in this
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
amendment to uh to define what we're
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
talking about when we're talking about
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
the commissioner the department the fair
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
the fund itself meaning the capital
 
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
improvement program fund for the fairs
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
established in
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
this rsa
 
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
the capital improvement program grant
 
00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:43.030 align:start position:0%
the capital improvement program grant
fund

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
would have each fiscal year
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer would transfer into
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
this capital improvement grant fund
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
the sum of 250 000 and my amendment
 
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:57.519 align:start position:0%
which was incorporated into this
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
would put a cap on that fund of a
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
so that you know at least we have
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
a fund that's not going to accrue and
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
accrue and accrue funds
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
this way we have a mechanism to say well
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
if there's a million dollars in this
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
fund then the state doesn't have to kick
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
in any more money into it
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
other parts of this here in page two
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh line three
 
00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:26.470 align:start position:0%
uh line three
and

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
all the way to uh line 24
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
gives the conditions by which
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
grants would be eligible to
 
00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:36.949 align:start position:0%
grants would be eligible to
the

00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
agricultural affair associations
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
and so those are enumerated in this
 
00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:47.590 align:start position:0%
and so those are enumerated in this
section

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:53.910 align:start position:0%
 
to

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
going on to the next page as well
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
the capital improvement grant
 
00:12:58.639 --> 00:13:00.150 align:start position:0%
the capital improvement grant
disbursements

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
disbursements
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
and how
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
that whole mechanism would work
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
the commissioner would may allocate 95
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
of the capital improvement program grant
 
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.750 align:start position:0%
of the capital improvement program grant
funds

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
including fund interest to eligible
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
applicant fares
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
and distribute those funds according to
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
merit as measured by a merit rating set
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
we have another the next section which
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
is on page three
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh also defining
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
uh how the department would develop and
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
manage appropriate contracts with the
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
selected applicants
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
provisions in the contracts
 
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.910 align:start position:0%
provisions in the contracts
and

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know just basically how this program
 
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959 align:start position:0%
would work
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
there's also a reporting mechanism that
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
was added in
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
on page 3 lines 24-30
 
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
which says that
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
annually the commissioner would compile
 
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
a report
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
detailing the number of disbursements
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
from this fund the amount of each
 
00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:02.629 align:start position:0%
from this fund the amount of each
disbursement

00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
disbursement
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
the entities that received the
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
disbursement and the purposes of the
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
disbursement and so on
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
and that report would be distributed to
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
the house of representatives as
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
the speaker of the house the president
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
of the senate
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
chairpersons of house ways and means and
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
house and senate
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
finance committees
 
00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:25.030 align:start position:0%
finance committees
and

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
house and senate committees with
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over environmental and
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
agricultural issues by november 1st of
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
each year so there's a reporting
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
mechanism that was added into this bill
 
00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:37.430 align:start position:0%
mechanism that was added into this bill
too

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
there's also an auditing
 
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.030 align:start position:0%
there's also an auditing
section

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.269 align:start position:0%
section
and

00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
and how those audits should take place
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
um also
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
on page four we talk about um you know
 
00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
what happens if there's a failure to
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
keep any kind of records or books on
 
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.670 align:start position:0%
keep any kind of records or books on
this

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
and um and that's pretty much what this
 
00:14:58.079 --> 00:14:59.430 align:start position:0%
and um and that's pretty much what this
um

00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is is really
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
kind of uh
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
get into the weeds and clarify
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
how this program will work and how the
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
funds should be set up and how the funds
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
should be dispersed from this fund so
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representation uh we
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
have the commissioner here commissioner
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
sean jasper of
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of agriculture
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
have you seen this
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and do you agree
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
yes yes i have i had um proposed a a
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
version of this late last last week
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's been much improved over what i uh
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
what i had proposed and i am in support
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
of it part of
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
what i did and the reason you'll see it
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
moves to 425 because there was already a
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
section that authorized
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
money's going to the fair it just has
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
not had money appropriated to it but it
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
went in a different way so this was the
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
audit function
 
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
is what is in current law
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
so that's already there and so this just
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
melds the proposed bill
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
together with current law and make some
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
great improvements to it in my my
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
opinion and
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate the work that went into
 
00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.949 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate the work that went into
this

00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
i hope there's a good answer to this
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
because i don't want to
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
have to redo it
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
but on page 3 line 31
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
the oh it it also is in current law but
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
it referred to on the old agricultural
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
fare support
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
program which hasn't been respected for
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
decades apparently
 
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.790 align:start position:0%
decades apparently
on

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.590 align:start position:0%
on
what

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
what does it mean now repairs
 
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
in case of partial or total destruction
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
of the building by fire or otherwise the
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner may make needed repairs or
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
replacement with the approval of
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
governor and council
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
and use proceeds of any insurance i
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
think it originally was talking about
 
00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:09.829 align:start position:0%
think it originally was talking about
the

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
new hampshire building at the newink new
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
england i forget what you call it
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
states fair
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so
 
00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:21.990 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so
the

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.990 align:start position:0%
the
425

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
425
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
19 was simply about the fairs
 
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.309 align:start position:0%
19 was simply about the fairs
the

00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
law dealing with
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
the big e is in a separate section of
 
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.190 align:start position:0%
the big e is in a separate section of
law

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
so i think this
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
really was about the case if buildings
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
were destroyed on fairgrounds
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
that rather than going through the
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
entire process we could
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
react more quickly than than normal to
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
allow those buildings to be back up and
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
running again
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
because obviously it's one thing to to
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
plan for an upgrade or a facility or a
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't impact the ongoing
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
operation but if the building is
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
destroyed by
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
by fire such as what we saw
 
00:18:11.679 --> 00:18:13.270 align:start position:0%
by fire such as what we saw
at

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
granite state which is the old rochester
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
that would impact that year's
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
fare so this section would allow that to
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
take place much more quickly i would
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
simply need to go to g and c to make
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
that happen so thank you i think i think
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
this makes sense
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
saying no further questions
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
then i
 
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:43.909 align:start position:0%
then i
uh

00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
anybody else have
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
anything to say
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything so what i'm going
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
to do is
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'm not sure if
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
this question is really aimed at
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner jasper
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
or the co-sponsors but
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of page one
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
in lines 31 and 32
 
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
a new sentence has been added to
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
create the
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
upper limit of a million dollars of the
 
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
accumulated capital
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
but if i'm reading it correctly
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
this says that in any year in in which
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
the balance is more than a million
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
dollars no transfer will be made
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
but in any year in which the
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
balance is under a million
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
a transfer would be made so my question
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
is there happens to be 999
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars in the account does
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
that mean 250 goes in and it becomes a
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
million 249
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
represent aaron do you
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
i would imagine that would be true
 
00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.390 align:start position:0%
i would imagine that would be true
um

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.390 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
i i think that the
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
particularly using the words is at least
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
implies that that is the answer but i'm
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
not sure whether it was the intended
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
answer i thought perhaps the intention
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
was to set a ceiling of a million
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
and to make a transfer
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
in the amount that would close the gap
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
but not exceed a million
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
any responses
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative chamber may i ask the
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner presently how much money is
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
that grant or that fund right now for
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
this well the fund that
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
previously in theory exists is the
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
premium fund and there is no money in
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
that that account that has been a
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
dormant account
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
since sometime in the 80s
 
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.190 align:start position:0%
since sometime in the 80s
follow-up

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.630 align:start position:0%
follow-up
follow-up

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
do you see this
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
amount of money ever reaching a million
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
dollars just theoretically
 
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
the only time i would see that is if
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
there was an extreme need on on one fare
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
and everything else was doing well so if
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
there was a we knew that there was a
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
building or an infrastructure need that
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
was going to exceed a million dollars
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
and couldn't be done in phases then i
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
could see that as a possibility i do not
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
see that as a likelihood
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
but i think the answer the question is
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
if there was 990 000 or you know
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
999 000 in there you put
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
you know went out up to
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
1.2 49 million
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
um that wouldn't
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
be a bad thing but if it stayed at that
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
level there'd be no distribution in the
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
next year so
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
um i would hope that that would not be
 
00:21:56.159 --> 00:21:57.270 align:start position:0%
um i would hope that that would not be
something

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
there could be planning ongoing
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
if not i'm coming out of the work
 
00:22:07.679 --> 00:22:09.590 align:start position:0%
if not i'm coming out of the work
session

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i do
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
okay representative romney
 
00:22:13.919 --> 00:22:14.630 align:start position:0%
okay representative romney
so

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
in hearings i was saying that not nephew
 
00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.909 align:start position:0%
in hearings i was saying that not nephew
uh

00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
mr commissioner no this is just a
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
general comment for the group
 
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.710 align:start position:0%
general comment for the group
so

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
i was the one saying that this bill was
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
really a finance bill but came to us
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
but we got word from the chair of
 
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
finance that this will be funded if we
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
pass it the 250 000 at least for next
 
00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.310 align:start position:0%
pass it the 250 000 at least for next
year

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
so i just thought you would want to know
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
just continuing on that same subject i
 
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
guess uh that
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
makes clear what i
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
is my understanding that there will need
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
to be an appropriation
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
each year
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
for each each budget year
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
for it to happen don't believe that just
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
having these words in this bill
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
mean that 250 000 is going to transfer
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
automatically right
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
right all i all we know is that in the
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
second year of this
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
this two-year budget that the second
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
year of the budget there will there will
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
be they will fund that 250 000
 
00:23:23.039 --> 00:23:23.830 align:start position:0%
be they will fund that 250 000
but

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
and going forward we have no idea it's
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
every legislature will come up with
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
just to to get that a little bit closer
 
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:38.870 align:start position:0%
just to to get that a little bit closer
uh

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.909 align:start position:0%
uh
if

00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
on the way that it would stop coming
 
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.470 align:start position:0%
on the way that it would stop coming
is

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.350 align:start position:0%
is
either

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
that they change this law or
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
that the finance committee puts into the
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
budget as they frequently do we're not
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
doing this law this year
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
in other words we're suspending this
 
00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.669 align:start position:0%
in other words we're suspending this
section

00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
and they could always do that yeah
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
any further uh representative spellsbury
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman i mean others
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
more experienced in this sort of law
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
will give me a quick answer on this in
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
in lines 28 and 29
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
the fun shall be non-lapsing and
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated does that
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
phrase refer only to those funds that
 
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
have been carried over from prior years
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative tucker well i'd just like

time on what seems to be
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
you know a small amount of money
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
relative to what we often deal with but
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
these pairs are very important
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%

we're here to look at the only the

00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
part of the bill

what we will do to raise revenues
 
00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%

representative

00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
given a lot of the discussion is going
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
to be based on an agreement that we
 
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
should all have as to what we think the
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
net revenue is going to be to the state
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
so can we have an informal conversation
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
about that and maybe an offline vote
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
because that would not be part of the
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
that would not be part of the amendment
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
it's more
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
what we think as a committee the
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
revenues will be
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
once it's up and running for a while not
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
not the first year we know it's gonna
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
it's gonna
 
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
you know we we came up with a number of
 
00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.230 align:start position:0%
you know we we came up with a number of
about

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
50 million uh but when we take out the
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh i think we talked about last time if
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
we take out the edibles
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
that would go down by 40 so whatever
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
so i i just want to make sure that
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
because someone's going to ask us that
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
what what does the
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
committee officially believe the
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
revenues are going to be
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
i can see that happening on the floor or
 
00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.029 align:start position:0%
i can see that happening on the floor or
wherever

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
wherever
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
we should at least have our official
 
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
agreement on that if we cut
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
it may not be unanimous agreement but we
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
should have a a vote on that
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
separate whether it's a straw poll or
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
however the chair wants to handle that
 
00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.310 align:start position:0%
however the chair wants to handle that
um

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%

is supposed to contain a revenue
estimate

00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
particularly if the original revenue
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
estimate was very vague because this one
 
00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:51.110 align:start position:0%
estimate was very vague because this one
was

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
let me ask representation you were
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair i apologize i am working on
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
a chart in excel to show the revenue
 
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
estimates i think we ran through it last
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
time and i gave some numbers based on
 
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
both the estimate and the cost on the
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
fact that we're doing
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better word a stagger
 
00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.310 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better word a stagger
staged

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
staged
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
rollout right that we're not going to do
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
all 10 stores on day one i can run
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
through the numbers again
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
if anybody wants and then i'll email
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
them out to everybody i honestly we're
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
expecting one more amendment to replace
 
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
the amendment that's on our table
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
because i got some conversations over
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
the weekend and i got an email from mr
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
simon up this morning that had some
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
language changes i thought were
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate we can go over those i've
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
already sent them the ols
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
but they're all still based off the
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that we have in front of us
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
which is 11.52
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
but if you want to run through the
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates for you so we have a
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
general idea what we're talking about
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
why don't you just run through them
 
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.230 align:start position:0%
why don't you just run through them
great

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
so i based all of our revenue estimates
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
off the uh the sheet given to us by the
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire liquor commission
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
on the new hampshire commission they
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
estimated our gross revenues around 250
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
million dollars however and our our net
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
revenues or i should say our our gross
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
net gross gross
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
gross net at um 50 million dollars to
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
the state so we'll sell 200 million 250
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of product out of
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
that 250 million dollars we expect will
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
generate about 50 million dollars in
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
profit for the state
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
from that profit we have we we have to
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
realize that this does not include
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
edibles right that their original
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
estimates were based on
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
selling all the products
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
we on a conservative basis chose 40
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
percent meaning that we actually i think
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
it's going to be less than that but 40
 
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
percent was the amount of revenue that
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
was generated towards edibles so from
 
00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.589 align:start position:0%
was generated towards edibles so from
that

00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars you have to subtract
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
20 20 million dollars
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
is the lost revenue because we're not
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
going to be selling edibles at on a
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
recreational side so our new uh adjusted
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
is is the gross that'll be coming into
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
the state from that and then we can so
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
that's the number that we'll be
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
receiving and then from there there's
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
some expenditures that come out of that
 
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
but 30 million is a rough estimate
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
once all the stores are up and up and
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
running based on the
 
00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.310 align:start position:0%
running based on the
testimony

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
and the stores you're talking about is
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
that 10 stores
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
right so the the basis was the revenues
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh estimates were all based off 10
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
stores um and the original 14 million
 
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
dollar ask we've decided in in
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
consultation with the laker commission
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
that we're not doing all 10 stores year
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
one the reality is they'll build three
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
to four stores which only requires a 4.6
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
million dollar ask of the state
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
so it'll be two to three years before
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
we're at a full revenue projection so in
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
the first year we can assume it's going
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
to be one-third of that 30 million
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
dollars so our profit's going to be
 
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
about 10 million dollars in the first
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
year 30 million 20 million dollars in
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
the second year and then in the third
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
year we'll be at 30 million dollars so
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
it's approximately 10 million dollars if
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
they keep adding three to four stores
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
each year it'll go up by
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
10 million each year until we get where
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
we're at
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing limiting us to 10
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
stores that's correct so again in the
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
amendment we talked about this briefly
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
in the um hearing there's no limitations
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
in the um in the bill for the number of
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
stores so to fix the fact that if we
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
need more than 10 stores um we i treated
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
this just like we do liquor stores in in
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
liquor all the revenue that comes in if
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
the if the state wants to open up
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
another store it has to come out of
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
their gross net profits their operating
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
expense so they add the cost of a new
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
store into their operating expense and
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
then subtract it from the revenue that
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
comes from that that came into the state
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
so we're doing the same exact model with
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
the cannabis stores so as the state
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
makes money they can hold back some of
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
the profits from disbursement so they
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
can open the next store
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
so it's a as they make revenue they can
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
open up more stores with the 10 million
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
dollars they'll be able to it's
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
estimated that they'll make enough money
 
00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
to open three stores in the second year
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
it does mean that we don't get as much
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
disbursement in that first year to the
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
other agencies because we're using it to
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
open up the next set of stores so it'll
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
take a while before we get to full full
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
boat so to speak and all the agencies
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
will start getting their money at a
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
higher level
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
would you say that these are
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
moderate conservative
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
estimates i believe they're extremely
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
conservative estimates i think that
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
they'll actually make more revenue than
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
we're projecting but i also don't want
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
to over project and then come up short
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
any questions representative lang
 
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
so i've been thinking about our
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
conversation last
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
friday and uh on this edibles question
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
with it out of the uh
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
picture for the liquor commission
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
what uh
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
we did on friday and what representative
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
lang and his faith
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
truly accurately uh reported is uh to
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
look at sort of the proportion
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
that edibles have uh been of
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
the total sales in other states
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
that's where the 40 percent on the
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
conservative side
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.670 align:start position:0%
comes from
but

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
if new hampshire has stores in which
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
edibles are not sold
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
won't it be the case that customers
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
near the borders on either side of the
 
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.870 align:start position:0%
near the borders on either side of the
border

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
border
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
who have stores nearby in our
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
neighboring states
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
where edibles are sold
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
that they will that customers will
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
still go to those stores if edibles are
 
00:38:50.079 --> 00:38:52.310 align:start position:0%
still go to those stores if edibles are
important

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
to their consumption pattern
 
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:55.670 align:start position:0%
to their consumption pattern
um

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
rather than across the border the liquid
 
00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:02.630 align:start position:0%
rather than across the border the liquid
commissions

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission will not be in the
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
position that it is with liquor
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
similar products on either side of the
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
border being able to
 
00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.030 align:start position:0%
border being able to
sell

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
sell
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
premier products
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
that are in direct competition with
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
products of the same
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
premier quality
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
at a lower price it will simply not have
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
the product and if it doesn't have the
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
product people will not come to the
 
00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.589 align:start position:0%
product people will not come to the
store

00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
store
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
and won't buy the products that the
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
liquor commission does have even though
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
they might be at a lower price
 
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.270 align:start position:0%
they might be at a lower price
because

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
they'll get
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
what they want which may include both
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
kinds of products
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh locally um so my sense my expectation
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
would be that the loss would be greater
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
than the proportion
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh that the sales in other states show
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
because of this phenomenon you know you
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
go to the store that has
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
all the things you want not to this
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
store and then that store unless there's
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
an extraordinary difference in price for
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
a part of the product so my expectation
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
would be we're going to lose more
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.359 --> 00:40:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll just remind the committee
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
i ran through these numbers with the
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner when they were here and
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
their anticipation is that these numbers
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
are accurate so that was there when they
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
were here and we i ran through both the
 
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
revenue side as well as the costing side
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
to see what was going to cost us to make
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
sure we had enough to roll back into the
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
program to open the next door so we
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
didn't have to do another appropriation
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
and the commissioners said that our
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
numbers were accurate and that they felt
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
that that was what they would project as
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
well on and i by no stretch know the
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
marijuana market by um and any any uh
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
provision but again i'm going to rely on
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
them they've done the they gave us the
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
first initial and i will also say
 
00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
representative ames if you
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
and again the bill that's coming out
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
based on the conversation and based on
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
what i i know what's going on is as i as
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
i the amendment that we're waiting on
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
based on our conversation around edibles
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
is basically the the amendment i ask for
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
would define edibles is basically food
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
or drink
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
right so gummies cookies brownies
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
you can't get a red bill with cannabis
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
infused right so that would be that
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
those were going to be the prohibited
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on the liquor store
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
well that's welcome news i think we
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
needed that clarification well that's
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
that's what i put in was i put in that
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
it would it would it would be food or
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
drink cannabis infused food or drink
 
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:45.829 align:start position:0%
drink cannabis infused food or drink
products

00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry which also means that
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
and originally when we talked about
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
edibles we had we also included
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
cartridges to get to that 40 percent
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
because the the real number even if you
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
look at massachusetts numbers
 
00:41:58.319 --> 00:41:59.270 align:start position:0%
look at massachusetts numbers
are

00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh the edibles as they define them which
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
includes basically the food and drink
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
products were only about 15 percent of
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
their mark of their product because the
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
the the cartridges and and the um
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
concentrates and the tinctures and the
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh the ointments or topicals um
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
would all now become
 
00:42:19.119 --> 00:42:20.150 align:start position:0%
would all now become
legally

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
legally
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
able to sell in the state stores
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
and if i may uh
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
mr chair represent
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to respond to
 
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
representative lang's response to what i
 
00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:36.230 align:start position:0%
representative lang's response to what i
said

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
i have great respect for the liquor
 
00:42:37.839 --> 00:42:39.510 align:start position:0%
i have great respect for the liquor
commissioner

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
but he is the liquor commissioner
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
and he's as new to cannabis as we are
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
well i should say as i am i know there
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
are others
 
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
in the room that are much more uh savvy
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
on this than i am
 
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:52.790 align:start position:0%
on this than i am
um

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
but i think uh common sense applies here
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
and uh if the liquor stores are narrowed
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
to selling
 
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
products that do not include edibles i
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
think the
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
impact on
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
sales and on
 
00:43:10.319 --> 00:43:11.349 align:start position:0%
sales and on
uh

00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
sort of the uh the movement of customers
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
to the our stores rather than the
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
neighboring states stores will be
 
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.829 align:start position:0%
neighboring states stores will be
um

00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
will be the impact will be greater and
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
the movement will be less to our stores
 
00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.190 align:start position:0%
the movement will be less to our stores
so

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
i would uh
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
say that although 40 seems conservative
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
at the beginning and may indeed have
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
included some items that were sold in
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
those other stores that will no longer
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
be edibles
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
under the new language
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
i still think that
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
that this model
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
with the liquor commission
 
00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.309 align:start position:0%
with the liquor commission
is

00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
likely to produce
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
more like half of what
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh it would produce but for this uh
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
exclusion of a much favored product from
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
everything we've heard
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh from the uh manual of items that the
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
followed by representative tucker
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr chair so
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
let's make sure we understand what the
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
liquor commission presented us
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
their analysis was based on a per capita
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh amount of revenue that it looks like
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
are brought in
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
so to me and you got to remember there's
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
only about 12 to 50 percent of the
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
population will partake in this
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not 50 percent it may be
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
growing a little bit but
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
it isn't like the market's going to
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
expand that much that we
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
when we legalize
 
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.270 align:start position:0%
when we legalize
so

00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh no matter how much marketing they do
 
00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:59.349 align:start position:0%
uh no matter how much marketing they do
so

00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
no 15.
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
thank you right
 
00:45:02.079 --> 00:45:03.030 align:start position:0%
thank you right
so

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
but but this is bait per capita so to me
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
when they said 50 million
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's the maximum that we're gonna get
 
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
once once the market once he's he'll
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
know when to stop opening stores
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
he'll he'll wisely open stores
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
and to a point where
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to water it down the the
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
number of customers are going to come to
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
store there's only so many stores that
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
we can open on this
 
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
and uh and that's so you understand
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
that's the ba that's the maximum
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
the way this analysis was done which is
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
very similar to when i chaired the
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
marijuana commission and i want to bore
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
you with that but
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
we came up with an estimate of 50
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
million as well
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh again with with edibles
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
so i that's why i feel comfortable with
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
the 50 million
 
00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:51.190 align:start position:0%
the 50 million
uh

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
i understand representative ames
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
i kind of agree with you a bit on that
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
that we may lose some customers if we
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
don't have edibles but i think we just
 
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
got to let this play out at this point
 
00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
uh if we if we pass this and we'll see
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
but again
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
they based it on 35 and 54 cents the
 
00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
average per capita
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
revenue and
 
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
and that's what they used and that was
 
00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.829 align:start position:0%
and that's what they used and that was
for

00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
not pers it's going to be a lot less if
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
we only have five stores open
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's it'll grow as we open more stores
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
but again it's going to reach a point
 
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
where the market's not going to grow
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
beyond a certain point
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
okay and and
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
and in my analysis in the liquor when we
 
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
did the marijuana commission
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
we included our state sales in that in
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
that analysis because we knew we would
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
get some out of state that would not be
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
in the per capita thing that we have and
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of tourists right
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
and i think representative abbott's kind
 
00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:48.790 align:start position:0%
and i think representative abbott's kind
of

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
i think you've thought that through as
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
well and some of the comments you've
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
made over over time that we will attract
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
some out-of-state business as well
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully they're consuming in the state
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
because it would be illegal for them to
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
bring it back but that's not our
 
00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:01.910 align:start position:0%
bring it back but that's not our
but

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
so that that's my comment on it
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you okay um
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
before i go to representative tucker
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment made some definitions of
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
what's sellable
 
00:47:16.319 --> 00:47:18.390 align:start position:0%
what's sellable
and

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
i just asked representative lang
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
what's not sellable by our stores are
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
the edibles and adjustables
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
but what is sellable
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
is the pre-rolls the accessories
 
00:47:32.079 --> 00:47:33.510 align:start position:0%
is the pre-rolls the accessories
topicals

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
topicals
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
the flour
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
cartridges and
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
concentrate according to the list i have
 
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
here essentially 18
 
00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.349 align:start position:0%
here essentially 18
of

00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
the items
 
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
are not soluble
 
00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:48.470 align:start position:0%
are not soluble
and

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
yeah and so that's defined in this
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
amendment is that correct
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
mr chair i apologize it's not defined in
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
this amendment it's because it came from
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative ames over the weekend and
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
i gave it to ols this morning so the
 
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
basically what i told ols is we want to
 
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
make sure the lane the only thing that's
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
prohibited from sale in the state
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis stores
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
edibles as defined by food or drink so
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
again cookies
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
gummies brownies
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
your red bull with cannabis in it so
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
those kind of things would be prohibited
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
for sale but all other items would be
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
available so if you look at
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh the the sheet that representative
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
abrami had given out um again that
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
represents about 18 of the revenue so
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
again when i i was conservative when i
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
said i took out 40 of the revenue saying
 
00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
that's what edibles was going to be i
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
think it's more likely 20. we'll have 10
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
million more dollars in there but
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
again i don't want to overestimate and
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
then come back short so i'd rather stick
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
to the 40
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
that we talked about
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
robson tucker yes i had a question and i
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
hope that if there's someone in the
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
audience who could answer it uh if uh
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative lang can't
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
we could call on them um
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
but do most people i mean i know nothing
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
about the topic uh really but do most
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
people most consumers
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
use both
 
00:49:09.119 --> 00:49:10.230 align:start position:0%
use both
edibles

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
edibles
 
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
and other cannabis products that that
 
00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:13.670 align:start position:0%
and other cannabis products that that
really

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
to answer representative ames's question
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
or comments we need to understand do
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
most people
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
by sort of both sides of
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
the aisle in the store or
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
do most people buy one or the other and
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
knowing that really will answer the
 
00:49:31.599 --> 00:49:32.549 align:start position:0%
knowing that really will answer the
question

00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
our sales along the massachusetts and
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
other borders will be affected by
 
00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:41.510 align:start position:0%
other borders will be affected by
the

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
prohibition of
 
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
food and drink edibles
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
do you know the answer are there other
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
people in the audience who might know
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
the answer i would have absolutely zero
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
idea but probably one of the atc people
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
in here could probably or that or the
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
gentleman from dhhs can answer
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
somebody who could provide some
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
so representative i think your question
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
is would people buy both flour and buy
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
gummies at the same time right yeah do
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
most people are they users of both
 
00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.109 align:start position:0%
most people are they users of both
products

00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
types of products
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative said i think just my
 
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
thought on this is is this is really
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
subjective it's dependent upon what the
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
customer wants if we were to take this
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
argument and apply it to what we have
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
for a model in the liquor store i would
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
contend that beer
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
and wine sales far exceed
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
hard liquor sales but that argument
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
could be made
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
on the model that we have for liquor
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
stores right now we can't come to a
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
in this we can all assume what we'd lose
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
as far as edibles
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
but i don't think we're going to come to
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
a rock solid number because the argument
 
00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
can be made
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
you know against the
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
the liquor model that we have right now
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to have customers
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
that come to new hampshire to buy
 
00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that they want and if
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
they look for another product they'll go
 
00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
to another place if if they so desire so
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of this discussion is is
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
something we're not going to have a
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
representative abbas
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
one part of the possession limits that's
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
not being taken to consideration
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the flower
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
the possession limit would be four
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
ounces which is significantly higher
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
than any of the
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation we've had in the
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
past i know hb 237 the possession limit
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
would have been one ounce so to the
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
extent that a consumer from out of state
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
did come to new hampshire to make a
 
00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:46.069 align:start position:0%
did come to new hampshire to make a
purchase

00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
the they would be able to purchase a
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
larger amount than they would under
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
other policies now will that offset the
 
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
loss of revenue from not allowing
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
certain edible products i can't answer
 
00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
that exactly but there will be some
 
00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:59.270 align:start position:0%
that exactly but there will be some
increased

00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
increased
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh revenue share to out-of-state
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
consumers because for that reason and
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
the reason why we made the possession
 
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
limit that high was exactly
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
for that reason was to
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
potentially capture out-of-state
 
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:16.829 align:start position:0%
potentially capture out-of-state
consumers

00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.839 --> 00:52:18.390 align:start position:0%
 
representation

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i have a
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
question yes i have a question about um
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative lang's
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
numbers i don't know if i understood it
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
correctly i thought he said that once 10
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
stores are up and running the net will
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
be 30 million
 
00:52:33.839 --> 00:52:36.069 align:start position:0%
be 30 million
okay

00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
and then i think i also heard you say
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
for every store that's added after that
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
there's a 10 million dollar
 
00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
increase in net so i'm not sure how did
 
00:52:44.559 --> 00:52:45.910 align:start position:0%
increase in net so i'm not sure how did
10

00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
10
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
no i apologize so again it goes it goes
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
as stores exceed that we get
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
if we use the same math we just used to
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
get where we were it's basically for
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
every three stores we're adding 10
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of revenue right
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
so it as they grow that's kind of the
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
model that'll look like so it's about
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
three million per se per store roughly
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
again that that's extremely conservative
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.589 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.109 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
uh

00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
i think i agree with representative lang
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
now that he's explained i had not
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
realized that so much of what we used to
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
call edibles is vaping
 
00:53:30.079 --> 00:53:31.349 align:start position:0%
call edibles is vaping
uh

00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:31.359 --> 00:53:32.309 align:start position:0%
uh
but

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
i wanted
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh with your permission to add uh
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
another question which uh would come up
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
later but which i might forget at that
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
point because i'm not sure where it is
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
00:53:45.119 --> 00:53:46.309 align:start position:0%
in the bill
uh

00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
do does this also exclude the
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh atc
 
00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:54.390 align:start position:0%
uh atc
edibles

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
edibles
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
from these stores so that the
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
the centers would stay
 
00:53:59.839 --> 00:54:02.150 align:start position:0%
the centers would stay
alive

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
alive
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
so the current bill the current
 
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of you leaves
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
the medical
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
medical edibles in in the state cannabis
 
00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.069 align:start position:0%
medical edibles in in the state cannabis
stores

00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
stores
 
00:54:12.079 --> 00:54:12.950 align:start position:0%
stores
um

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
and we can have a discussion around that
 
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
again i can prepare a bill that an
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
amendment that includes them in and
 
00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
includes them out but the current one
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
includes them in and again
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
in this bill one of the things we added
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
is the ability for atc's to act as a
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
parrot with
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
to obtain a parallel license
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
to act as marijuana cultivators
 
00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.870 align:start position:0%
to act as marijuana cultivators
manufacturers

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
and trans transport people for the state
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
program which gives them an entirely new
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
revenue stream for their for their uh
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
organizations so and again the reason in
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
doing that was a gives us access to
 
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
immediately to people growing marijuana
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not trying to ramp it up
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
so much and the new stores that are
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
opening have a source to be able to go
 
00:54:56.799 --> 00:54:57.589 align:start position:0%
opening have a source to be able to go
to

00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
but the other reason is that we
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
recognize that we may be doing a little
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
harm in this bill um to those programs
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
and so to give them and this is the
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
trade-off to give them additional
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
revenue streams um you know we don't
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
know where this is going to go
 
00:55:12.079 --> 00:55:13.270 align:start position:0%
know where this is going to go
ultimately

00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
but as it's here i want to make sure
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
i recognize we are potentially doing
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
harm by allowing the medical marijuana
 
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
in the state store and i gave to
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
mitigate that harm i allowed them to
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
apply for a parallel license to the
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
state um to be able to make revenue up
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
so to speak
 
00:55:31.599 --> 00:55:32.470 align:start position:0%
so to speak
and

00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's just a follow-up
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
on do we have any indication from that
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
group that they would be able to take
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
i there's nobody who's directly said
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'll apply for one of those licenses if
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
that's what you're asking for so if
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
you're looking for a definitive answer
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
the answer is no
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
if you're looking for a subjective
 
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
answer i'd argue that they're already in
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
the market and it gives them a way to
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
increase their market cap in their
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
market space and they jump on it right
 
00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:05.589 align:start position:0%
market space and they jump on it right
away

00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
are you all set representative
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i just
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
i would like
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
us to talk to them but thank you
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wanted to say that based on
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
what's been said um
 
00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
i'm fine with the 30 million dollar
 
00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
figure that representative lang has come
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
up with i actually agree with
 
00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
representative doucet that
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
at some point we just have to
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
acknowledge our limits and
 
00:56:33.599 --> 00:56:34.390 align:start position:0%
acknowledge our limits and
in

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
estimating impact of things like those
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
that i
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
was expressing concern about the absence
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
of a sought-after product and how that
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
will affect particularly in interstate
 
00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.510 align:start position:0%
will affect particularly in interstate
movement

00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
movement
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
but uh 30 million dollars i think takes
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
into account
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
a number of
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
uncertainties and uh that's fine with me
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
if we need to
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
go forward and
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
try to get marching through the bill so
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
go to issues like that
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative ami just raised in a in
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.079 --> 00:57:15.030 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
represent gamalo i couldn't see you over
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
there i know i'm hiding again
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
um i just needed a clarification from
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
susan about what she just said about
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
vaping at the beginning of her question
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
and edibles
 
00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.030 align:start position:0%
and edibles
um

00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
vapings cartridges are going to be sold
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
because that's correct
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
yes again the limit i i think um
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
originally we kind of when you say
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
ingesting right so you ingest is vaping
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
ingesting you know because then right so
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
came a question of what's ingestible so
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
to speak and so the amendment that i
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
requested from ols this morning was to
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
make sure we're clear that the idea of
 
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
edibles is the food and drink category
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
okay so so card cartridges would be
 
00:57:58.079 --> 00:57:59.109 align:start position:0%
okay so so card cartridges would be
allowed

00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
yes and also concentrates
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
topicals and uh
 
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
and pre-rolls
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
may i have one more question please
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.270 align:start position:0%
go ahead
um

00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
i can't find what's in i can't find
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
what's included in the 250 million
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
it would be the sales of everything
 
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
including is that an estimate if we did
 
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
sell edibles
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
so i think the liquor commission when
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
they answered said that was their
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
assumption everything was legal
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
um and then so that's why we have to
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
start backing things out was because we
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
know we're not going to be selling the
 
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh edibles and so we have to back out
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
they theirs their original bill and
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
financial note was based on everything
 
00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
being legal
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
my question is should they not be backed
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
out at the top out of the 250 million
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
and not on revenue because they're never
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
mathematically sure it comes back to the
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
same thing i could take twenty percent
 
00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
out and actually
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
so i can do the math i can do the math
 
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
the other way i i just started with the
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
gross number they had and then backed
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
out of that
 
00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
but i can do it the other way when i
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
send this sheet out
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it does make a difference
 
00:59:11.359 --> 00:59:12.390 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it does make a difference
um

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.829 align:start position:0%
um
maybe

00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.990 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
um

00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury thank you mr
 
00:59:20.319 --> 00:59:22.230 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury thank you mr
chairman

00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
i i understand there's another amendment
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
coming and i'm not sure what it's going
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
to modify but
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
would i be generally correct to assume
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
that what can be sold
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
is essentially
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
the aggregation of the definition of
 
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.670 align:start position:0%
the aggregation of the definition of
cannabis

00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
on page these are all on page two
 
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
the definition of cannabis
 
00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.630 align:start position:0%
the definition of cannabis
products

00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
and the definition of cannabis
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
accessories and if that's not exactly
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
true what else there is there in the
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
bill that would either add to or
 
00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:55.910 align:start position:0%
bill that would either add to or
subtract

00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
subtract
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:01.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
the cannabis products again
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
representative abbas did a good job in
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
making this a forward-looking bill um in
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
that if you look at catabol cannabis
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
products in the definition it includes
 
01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.789 align:start position:0%
products in the definition it includes
edibles

01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
edibles
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
in the definition of what a cannabis
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
product is however later on in the bill
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
we have what we have a section where we
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
strike out the edibles right so you can
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
say all cannabis products except for and
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's what they're going to fix in the
 
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
bill that we just had
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
um is the or the amendment i'm
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
requesting is taking out the food and
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
drink cannabis infused products
 
01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise yes everything that's under
 
01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis products might just point me to
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
where in the bill i'm looking for the
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
subtraction representative ames might be
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
able to do that better than i can
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
because i was trying to find it and i
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
was struggling to he he went through and
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
did a really in-depth this is where
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
we're prohibiting
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
so if he would like to answer i think he
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
might be better
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
i'll give it a try i wasn't ready for
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
the what i
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
tried to point to were the various parts
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
bill just as you are
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
that relate to this question and
 
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
we i started with the exclusion
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
from the definition of cannabis so this
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
is defined at page 2 lines 26 to 7
 
01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.270 align:start position:0%
is defined at page 2 lines 26 to 7
27

01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
27
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
and excluded from cannabis is the weight
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
of any other ingredient
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
combined with cannabis to prepare
 
01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
topical or oral administration's
 
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
food drink or other product
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
so there's one provision we have to keep
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
in mind
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
the second is the possession limit which
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
i think you
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
fingered um
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
and in that case it's uh
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
there are actually two provisions
 
01:01:48.319 --> 01:01:49.829 align:start position:0%
there are actually two provisions
um

01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:49.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
affected by the possession limit
 
01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh and i don't have that language right
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
in front of me
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
but you have to look at i think we're
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
looking then at page 3 line 16 to 19.
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
i've got 19 to 22. 19 years ago that's
 
01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
the prohibition piece that we're
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
cleaning up
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
and then uh
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
that that possession limit is
 
01:02:11.839 --> 01:02:13.990 align:start position:0%
that that possession limit is
operationalized

01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
operationalized
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
um in
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
the provision that allows for personal
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
use of cannabis which is at page four
 
01:02:25.349 --> 01:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
and finally there's the definition of
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis products
 
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
which is on page three at line ten and
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
that is a definition that includes
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
quote edible products ointments and
 
01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:42.470 align:start position:0%
quote edible products ointments and
tinctures

01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
there's the
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
language at page 12 lines three to four
 
01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:49.839 align:start position:0%
that says that shall be the duty of the
 
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
commission to buy and have in its
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
possession cannabis for sale
 
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
so i flagged all of these i didn't offer
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
a solution
 
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
i sent them to representative lying
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
saying i think there's a lot of
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
confusion here i'm confused and uh
 
01:03:05.119 --> 01:03:05.990 align:start position:0%
confusion here i'm confused and uh
it

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
if you go forward with an amendment i
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
think you should try to address all of
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
these provisions i think he's done that
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
i think what we should do is look at the
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
amendment and see see how it works
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative james i
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
think we need to now look at the latest
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
amendment which is
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
which is not the
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
amendment coming
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
but it probably has everything
 
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
except for
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
the definitions correct so the current
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
bill that's coming in i or the current
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that come that's coming in
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
deals with the what edible is and making
 
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
sure that it's clear that those food and
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
drink items are not allowed to be sold
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
in state liquor stores except to medical
 
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
clients that's that's what it'll say in
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
a current in the current language
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
or in the language that's coming in the
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
amendment i just asked for this morning
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
but we could still go through the rest
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the ghosts there's some financial
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
stuff in here we probably want to talk
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
about and some of the other changes i
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
took out the 15 limit on cultivators in
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
why don't why don't we go to the
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that you just gave us which is
 
01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.150 align:start position:0%
amendment that you just gave us which is
income

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
which doesn't have the definition
 
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
modified and the amendment we're talking
 
01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:21.160 align:start position:0%
about is
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
22-1152h is that correct correct that's
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
the most current one the committee has
 
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
that deals with everything we talked to
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
up to friday and then over the weekend
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
late friday we had a conversation and
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
then over the weekend there was some
 
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
more stuff that came in i've submitted
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
an amendment to try to clean that up as
 
01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:35.510 align:start position:0%
an amendment to try to clean that up as
well

01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
let's let's do this right from start to
 
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.190 align:start position:0%
let's let's do this right from start to
finish

01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
finish
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
so represent a line
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
so i don't know mr j if you want to just
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
go page by page and just take questions
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
because again this is i think that might
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
be the easiest way rather than me try to
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
point out every single change that's on
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
here again we talked about most of the
 
01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
changes that are in here the only one
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
missing from friday is the testing which
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
i've added that that'll be coming in the
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
in the amendment for coming up let's
 
01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
so there were no changes this is
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
original bill language
 
01:05:11.359 --> 01:05:14.069 align:start position:0%
original bill language
um

01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
tucker on page one on line 16
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better to
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
and that's of the amendment right
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
all retail
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
cannabis stores
 
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
and this answers the question
 
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
you don't now have it that all cannabis
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
stores would be run by the state
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
and if you change 16 to
 
01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.630 align:start position:0%
and if you change 16 to
plural

01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
all

01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
the a would be in all
 
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
and stores would have an s on it
 
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
if i may so again mr chairman there's a
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
definition of retail cannabis stores and
 
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
on this the next on page
 
01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:58.870 align:start position:0%
on this the next on page
three

01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
and it says a retail cannabis store
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
retail store means a state operated
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
facility that purchased cannabis from
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis cultivating facilities and
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
purchased cannabis and cannabis products
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
from a cannabis manufacturing facility
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
and sells transfers delivers cannabis
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
and cannabis products to consumers
 
01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.390 align:start position:0%
and cannabis products to consumers
so

01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
in order to be
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
a retail cannabis store it means that
 
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
it's a state-owned facility but having
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
something that's on page one makes it
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
clear that this is a monopoly
 
01:06:25.839 --> 01:06:27.270 align:start position:0%
clear that this is a monopoly
arrangement

01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
arrangement
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire that only
 
01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
the state can sell
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
have a retail cannabis store
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
if that's the will of the committee i
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
can add the word all in front of it but
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
i think it's what you're driving at
 
01:06:43.829 --> 01:06:43.839 align:start position:0%
isn't it
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna be polite and say that this
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
is a forward-looking bill some of the
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
language that was put in here was put in
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
with the idea of if we want the changes
 
01:06:55.029 --> 01:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
to a full-blown
 
01:06:55.039 --> 01:06:56.630 align:start position:0%
to a full-blown
forward-looking

01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
forward-looking
 
01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:58.710 align:start position:0%
forward-looking
private

01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
private
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
stores and dispensaries
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
it's there's only a few sections of this
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
law you would have to change
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
i understand that that's why i'm
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
suggesting that this be very clear
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
so again if it's the will of the
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
committee i can i can add the word all
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
in front of um
 
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
all cannabis stores shall be operated by
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire that's the
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
will of the community i think if you
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
want a privatized system that's what you
 
01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.309 align:start position:0%
want a privatized system that's what you
should

01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
be aiming for i think this is
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
this is transparent clear this is what
 
01:07:30.799 --> 01:07:31.589 align:start position:0%
this is transparent clear this is what
we're

01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh page two we don't have any changes we
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
will have changes
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
that will deal with the definition of
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis to make sure that um
 
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:01.839 align:start position:0%
the again the cartridge that what we
 
01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
were talking about it only it's only
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
about the food
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
and drink provisions of that and i don't
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
know how that'll work out given the
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
language in section on line seven
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
um that this font that has a description
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
of cannabis and in there it talks about
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
prepared topical oral administrations
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
food drink and other products that
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
language is gonna change i'm sure i
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly how it's gonna change
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:46.799 align:start position:0%
so any questions on page two or
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
additions anybody would like to see on
 
01:08:50.789 --> 01:08:50.799 align:start position:0%
page two again mo this is current bill
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
language i didn't make any changes i
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
just know that
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
based on the conversation we represented
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
ames there will be some change relative
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
to again the food and drink conversation
 
01:08:59.759 --> 01:09:01.749 align:start position:0%
to again the food and drink conversation
representatives

01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure if i heard the comments
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
correctly but there was some suggestion
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
of perhaps removing the word mixture
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
which is page two
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
line nine
 
01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.510 align:start position:0%
line nine
and

01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
speaking in general
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
generally about any type of controlled
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
substance you it's
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
usually best to leave the word mixture
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
in there
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
in cases
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
and it comes to really an enforceability
 
01:09:27.199 --> 01:09:28.550 align:start position:0%
and it comes to really an enforceability
side

01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
side
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
from a prosecution side they would have
 
01:09:30.159 --> 01:09:30.950 align:start position:0%
from a prosecution side they would have
to

01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
show 100 purity
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
if you take out the term mixture also if
 
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's a thc product but perhaps it's
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
illegally laced with something else you
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
you can it gets a little complicated
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
when you deal with specific definitions
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
of synthetic or other manufactured drugs
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
that are legal so i would just recommend
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
for the sake of
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
not potentially opening a door of
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences leaving the word
 
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
there was i didn't receive any comments
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
asking to remove that over the weekend
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
page three mr chair
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
page three
 
01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.430 align:start position:0%
page three
so

01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
um i agree with somewhere we had a
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
conversation around here there's no
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
changes on this bill from the original
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
bill in here however i do think we need
 
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
to have a conversation around
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
lines 19 through 22
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
and talking about the fact that
 
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
this the idea of cannabis infused
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
products and making sure we're clear and
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
understanding what that is the the
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
purpose of this was basically to say um
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
that if you have a medical card
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
this doesn't apply right so this if you
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
have a therapeutic card um it doesn't
 
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
apply we i do know one change is going
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
to be and again this is at the request
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
of mr simon is all through here where we
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
talk about medical marijuana we're going
 
01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
to change the word the therapeutic
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire bill i made that
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
change request this morning
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about the therapeutic
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis and not medical cannabis
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
because there's in our statute we talk
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
in our 120 126x statutes we talk about
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use and therapeutic cannabis
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
and therapeutic cards so to speak not
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
medical cards so i'm going to make that
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
change the entire bill to make sure
 
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
we're consistent with other parts of our
 
01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:14.870 align:start position:0%
we're consistent with other parts of our
rsas

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
rsas
 
01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:15.669 align:start position:0%
rsas
okay

01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions on page three
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
represent elneny
 
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
thank you with regard to this but
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
especially future
 
01:11:24.159 --> 01:11:25.990 align:start position:0%
especially future
sections

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
sections
 
01:11:29.189 --> 01:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
there is a administrator
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
for the state medical cannabis program
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program oh he's
 
01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:35.910 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program oh he's
here

01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:36.709 align:start position:0%
here
oh

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
he wasn't speaking up
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
i think we need to talk with him about
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
this solution
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
um representative kirk is trying to find
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
canarque is trying to find you right now
 
01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.470 align:start position:0%
canarque is trying to find you right now
so

01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
so if i'm not mistaken and he can answer
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
that my statement is right we talk about
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use and not medical use is
 
01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:04.470 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use and not medical use is
that

01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
so are you in agreement that we should
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
change the word medical the therapeutic
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
in the bill to make it clear so it's
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
assuming we leave it in but we don't
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
want to leave it as medical with
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
therapeutic be the appropriate word to
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
mr chair there were no changes on page
 
01:12:46.149 --> 01:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
four unless somebody just has comments
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
in general about the page or suggested a
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
subject suggested change questions or
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
comments on page four
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh representation
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh so the top of
 
01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
page five
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh talks about you know a first fine
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
being five hundred dollars or up to five
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars no more than five
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%

01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
my concern would one of my major
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
concerns with this bill in the beginning
 
01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:27.270 align:start position:0%
concerns with this bill in the beginning
was

01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
driving under the influence
 
01:13:29.679 --> 01:13:30.630 align:start position:0%
driving under the influence
and

01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
this this addresses that except i'm
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
concerned that there's no
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
teeth really in this in that a judge
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
could say and a person could be on their
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
fifth offense and the judge keeps saying
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
yeah well you know it says up to so the
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
person could be fined at zero and they
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.430 align:start position:0%
could be
um

01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
not lose their license so i think there
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be some teeth in this i'd like
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
to see
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
the second and future offense
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
putting some lower limit on this so that
 
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
it's suspended for at least three months
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
but up to six and and at least five
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and up to a thousand
 
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
um there needs to be some teeth in that
 
01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:08.709 align:start position:0%
um there needs to be some teeth in that
because

01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
if a particular judge in a particular
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
area keeps letting someone off the hook
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be good
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
for safety of other drivers if i may mr
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
chair to respond to that so just
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
understand that this is not relative to
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
drugged or drunk driving that's not what
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about in this section this
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
section is specifically talking about
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
smoking or vaping in a car so you're not
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
allowed to smoke or vape in a car and if
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
you're caught smoking or vaping so even
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
if you just lit up the joint
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
and the cop sees your light up and walks
 
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
over you'll be guilty of this of this
 
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
violation that doesn't mean you're
 
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
guilty of drug driving or drunk driving
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
which has much more severe penalties
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
associated with it in a different
 
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
section of our chapter of law this is
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
strictly having to deal with smoking or
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
vaping marijuana products uh in a
 
01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.630 align:start position:0%
vaping marijuana products uh in a
vehicle

01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay but even in that case where there's
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
a penalty proposed here
 
01:14:59.040 --> 01:14:59.990 align:start position:0%
a penalty proposed here
so

01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
to get some uniformity from judge to
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
judge i would think we still need a
 
01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:05.189 align:start position:0%
judge i would think we still need a
minimum

01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's still a problem obviously it's
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
identified in the bill
 
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
so i would lastly i would just say that
 
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
this is consistent with our other
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
criminal statutes where you have a
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
violation level offense we don't ne
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
generally specify the hard number it's
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
it's up you know if you're guilty of a
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
violation is up to a five uh 500 fine if
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
you're guilty of a misdemeanor it's up
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
to a thousand dollar fine so these
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
this language is consists with other
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
parts of our law we can change it if we
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
want but generally that's what we say
 
01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
you're guilty of a violation with
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
limited exceptions we put a hard number
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
and say if you do criminal trespass
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
you've got to get you you're fined a
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars right we if you're
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
guilty of criminal trespass you're fined
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
up to a thousand dollars and the judge
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
takes into account all this mitigating
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
and extenuating and and uh
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
the one that means worse situations uh
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
and then sets the fine according to the
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
individual circumstances of a given
 
01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:59.430 align:start position:0%
individual circumstances of a given
offense

01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
i guess do we know whether anyone can
 
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
answer the question has this been a
 
01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
problem with other things where a
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
particular judge may keep letting
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
someone off the hook
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
i mean is this something that i will
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
tell you the former police officers and
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
there was judges i'd like to be in front
 
01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
of and judges i didn't like to be in
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
front of but that's just the nature of
 
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.990 align:start position:0%
front of but that's just the nature of
jurisprudence

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
jurisprudence
 
01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
of representative thank you um
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
mr chairman you know as well as i do
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
that criminal justice has always set
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
the judicial penalties
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
and i can't remember a time that we even
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
changed their thousand dollar fine to a
 
01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
250 dollar fine or something like that
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh this is policy from the previous
 
01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:46.830 align:start position:0%
uh this is policy from the previous
committee

01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
i agree with thank you mr chair i agree
 
01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
with representative almi this is a
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
policy issue policy settled on this
 
01:16:57.199 --> 01:16:58.550 align:start position:0%
policy issue policy settled on this
okay

01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.229 align:start position:0%
okay

um
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
further questions on page five
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
moving on to page six mr chair
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
page six um there is in the mem and i
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
requested this morning based on the
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
conversations we had on line 12 i'm
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
going to make one word change i'm going
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
to add it says current the current
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
amendment says requirements
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
for the testing of cannabis and this is
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
regarding what rules the
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
agency must set and we're going to just
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
change it to requirements for the
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
testing of all
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
is the a new word i'm going to add in
 
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
the middle of that
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis to make sure it's clear that
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
all cannabis that's going to be sold to
 
01:17:44.709 --> 01:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
consumer must be tested for equality and
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
adulterants and data
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
other than that on this bill i'm sorry
 
01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.910 align:start position:0%
other than that on this bill i'm sorry
representative

01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:52.709 align:start position:0%
representative
yes

01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
on i found this letter that was sent to
 
01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
us from
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
a2la which a lot of people may not have
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
opened because who knows what a2la
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
stands for
 
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
but it is the american association for
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
laboratory accreditation
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
and they had suggested two things about
 
01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.510 align:start position:0%
and they had suggested two things about
testing

01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
testing
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
the first one uh was defining what a
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
cannabis testing facility is
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
and the second one
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
was um
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
requirements for testing cannabis from a
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
facility accredited in accordance with
 
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
iso iec
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
etc by an accreditation body that is
 
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
internationally recognized to the
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
current version of etc to test cannabis
 
01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
for potency and contaminants
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
so it's not just potency it's also
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's laced with gasoline or
 
01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:53.110 align:start position:0%
whether it's laced with gasoline or
something

01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
so mr chair again if we look at the
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
entirety of the bill and not just that
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
one line we talk about regulation of
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis um
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
on number
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
seven health and safety rules including
 
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
regarding the packaging preparation
 
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
accounts restricting the use of
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
to consumers so again we have a
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
provision that says that as part of the
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority they have to take a
 
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
look at the health and safety rules to
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that these are taken care of
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
so again we could be more specific if we
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
want in the bill and be definitive and
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
say that all that you know
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
lab testing must be in compliance with
 
01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
the iso
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know without the commissioner
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
here and or dhhs here although the
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
gentleman from from the marijuana
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana program may be able to
 
01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
answer that um but uh i'd be
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
a little concerned about putting a
 
01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.350 align:start position:0%
a little concerned about putting a
hearts

01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
hearts
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
definition in here not giving the agency
 
01:19:47.679 --> 01:19:48.390 align:start position:0%
definition in here not giving the agency
there

01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
the ability to find out we may not even
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
have a testing facility that meets those
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
requirements in the state and there's
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
there's a secondary testing facility
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
that could do it that misses one
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know iso number or whatever it is so
 
01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
so again i'll leave it to the committee
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
to make that decision i'd be a little
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
hesitant to hard i think we're pretty
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
clear we want safe marijuana in our
 
01:20:08.239 --> 01:20:14.149 align:start position:0%
clear we want safe marijuana in our
stores

01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
explain i think that contaminants is a
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
much better word than pesticides
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
pesticides is a piece of what can
 
01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:23.990 align:start position:0%
pesticides is a piece of what can
contaminate

01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
contaminate
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
and the rules will probably end up
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
explaining what a contaminant is but
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of other
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
there are funguses there
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
are all kinds of things that could be in
 
01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.669 align:start position:0%
are all kinds of things that could be in
them

01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
including i must admit i lived next to
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
nigeria for a while gasoline
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
so representative almi how it number so
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
we're looking on page six line number
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
three if everyone wants to read along
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
number four
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
isn't it restrict that's what you were
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
looking at health and safety rules
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
correct it's line yeah that's like
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
that's line three
 
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
section number seven
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
um health and safety rules including
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
regarding the packaging and preparing of
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
cannabis comma
 
01:21:16.239 --> 01:21:18.390 align:start position:0%
cannabis comma
contaminants

01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
contaminants
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
comma and restricting the use of
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
pesticides that may be dangerous to
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
consumers does that work for you
 
01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.070 align:start position:0%
consumers does that work for you
uh

01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
well i was thinking just say the use of
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
ca oh no yeah contaminants right it's
 
01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
two different things we want to make
 
01:21:29.679 --> 01:21:32.229 align:start position:0%
two different things we want to make
sure

01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
that is pesticide is a contaminant
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
right but i i'm calling a special
 
01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
attention to that so again
 
01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
so is that that okay to everybody uh
 
01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.470 align:start position:0%
so is that that okay to everybody uh
well

01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:45.910 align:start position:0%
well
the

01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
the presence of
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:52.149 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.310 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you followed by representative
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
hatch thank you mr chairman
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
in respect to the definition of
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
of a pesticide it it's actually a very
 
01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:10.719 align:start position:0%
broad definition
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
it can include even
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
infused water with like garlic or other
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
or mint
 
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
to repel bugs if you can use that on
 
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
your lawn so
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
pesticides is really it
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
you want maybe you want to keep it in
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
but at the same time if you put any
 
01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
contaminants i think having both of them
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
might be the way to go
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
i just remember coming across on a
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
different issue that's one of the
 
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
reasons why we so again if i could
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
reread that sentence the way i'm
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
planning on submitting it as an
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
another addition to this amendment
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
health and safety rules including
 
01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
regarding of packaging and preparation
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
of cannabis comma presence of
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
contaminants comma and the restricting
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
the use of pesticides that may be
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
dangerous to cannabis consumers so i
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
think that that's the cleanest way to
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
add that oh
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
on is there no testing for potency
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
because this is very important for the
 
01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:09.270 align:start position:0%
because this is very important for the
labeling

01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
again if i i i know nothing about the
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
testing of cannabis so i don't know how
 
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
they would test for potency but maybe
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me mr chair
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
aren't we talking policy again versus
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
we're treading deeply in that yeah again
 
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
representative aaron i think we're
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
getting close but i also think that if
 
01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
it's a consumer protection issue and
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's important to this committee i think
 
01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
we're probably okay again
 
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
we talked about the other day it's the
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
what and the how right so the what is
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
legalization that was the policy that
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
was established by the criminal justice
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
committee now we're getting to the how
 
01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's being done right so i think we're
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay in the how conversation we're not
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay with the what conversation
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
yeah gotcha and if i could just point
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
out if we have a reputation for connect
 
01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.470 align:start position:0%
out if we have a reputation for connect
contaminated

01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
contaminated
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
product we are not going to earn any
 
01:24:18.639 --> 01:24:22.310 align:start position:0%
product we are not going to earn any
money

01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not worried about earning money i
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
want to keep my citizens safe
 
01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
potency is this the potency question
 
01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:35.189 align:start position:0%
potency is this the potency question
yeah

01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
oh on the potency my name is michael
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
holt i'm the administrator for the
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program within the
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
currently all therapeutic cannabis is
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
tested by an independent licensed
 
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
laboratory in the state of new hampshire
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
they are allowed to test cannabis only
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
for the atcs not for other
 
01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.229 align:start position:0%
for the atcs not for other
entities

01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:24:56.239 --> 01:24:57.030 align:start position:0%
entities
all

01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative ami's comments are
 
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
spot-on with regard to um
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of statutory language
 
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
that should be in here uh regarding
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
contaminants um and uh pesticides and
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
potency um it would be
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
it would be strange for the liquor
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
commission to not establish these
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
properly in the rule um however
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
legislative guidance is always
 
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
appreciated um when uh when drafting
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
rules um by putting in words like
 
01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
potency contaminants pesticides etc i
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
will say the primary concern that i have
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
this bill would set up the liquor
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
commission as the licensing entity for
 
01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
labs we hhs is also a licensing
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
entity for cannabis testing
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
again it's a duplication of regulatory
 
01:25:46.239 --> 01:25:49.189 align:start position:0%
again it's a duplication of regulatory
effort

01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
so mr chair just just to be clear
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
because i just finished reading through
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
some of the regulatory stuff so again
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
under lines 7 through 10 we talk about
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
labeling requirements of the product
 
01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:58.470 align:start position:0%
labeling requirements of the product
include

01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
mandating disclosure of the thc content
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
so there's our potency somehow we've got
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
to get a test to that to know what the
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
potency is in order to put it on the
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
label so there will be some testing of
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
the product to make sure they can meet
 
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
all the other provisions again it talks
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
about the requirements of the package
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
insurance not designed to appeal to
 
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
minors and establishing the amount of
 
01:26:17.110 --> 01:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
thc that may be included in the serving
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
of cannabis so again i think that that
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
definition says in order to meet a which
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
is mandating disclosure the thc content
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
someone's got to test it to figure out
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
how potent this stuff is and how much
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
thc is in the product so i think
 
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
the the testing for potency is already
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
implied in this bill
 
01:26:34.159 --> 01:26:35.030 align:start position:0%
implied in this bill
okay

01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.629 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:26:38.229 --> 01:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair the gentleman
 
01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
from hhs um expressed most of what i'm
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
concerned about and that's what we turn
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
over to the agency to develop rulemaking
 
01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:48.870 align:start position:0%
over to the agency to develop rulemaking
and

01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
there's some things that i've heard and
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
i need not add to what he had stated but
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
we need to be as explicit as possible in
 
01:26:58.390 --> 01:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
terms of developing or what's going to
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
be developed in rulemaking so the agency
 
01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
knows what's
 
01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
anticipated by the legislature who hands
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
them this package to develop the rules
 
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:08.790 align:start position:0%
them this package to develop the rules
for

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
and if we leave uh
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
my experience in in the rulemaking
 
01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
process if we leave a plethora of things
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
out that we assume will be added to it
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't always happen and there's not
 
01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
going to be any cross-check to assure
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
that it does happen just
 
01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh concerns so it sounds like this
 
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
discussion has identified these items in
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
which representative lang is going to
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
so we can i think we can move on
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
there are no other changes in the rest
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
of six so i identified two changes we're
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
going to do right now we're going to add
 
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
the presence of can contamination and
 
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
make sure the word all is involved in
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
the testing of all kinds representative
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
did you have a question well yes
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
just a suggestion i think in that same
 
01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:02.149 align:start position:0%
just a suggestion i think in that same
section

01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
roman 10 that you were just referring to
 
01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative lange
 
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't you put in requirements for
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
the testing of all cannabis for
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
maybe there's an end there i don't know
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
i can look at that again i think we
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
added contamination already when we talk
 
01:28:28.149 --> 01:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
about the health and safety rules i can
 
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
look under the labeling requirements
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
again we have a mandated for disclosure
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
thc content and i use for each product i
 
01:28:34.159 --> 01:28:35.030 align:start position:0%
thc content and i use for each product i
put

01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
put
 
01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
as indicated by testing or something
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
like that so that we know
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
my thought is that you have a write down
 
01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
in the requirement for the testing of
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
all canvas for potency and just but
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
including potency including potency and
 
01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:50.709 align:start position:0%
including potency including potency and
contamination

01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
i was going to concur with that
 
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
that doesn't hurt the representative no
 
01:28:56.229 --> 01:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
i'm concurring with that i mean it
 
01:28:57.669 --> 01:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't hurt to add
 
01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know potency
 
01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
so no other changes on that line so onto
 
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
line on page seven
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
page seven the biggest change in here is
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
on line three's roman numeral six and
 
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
this is where we allow the alternative
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
treatment centers to have parallel
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:23.110 --> 01:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments on that
 
01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:25.270 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments on that
representation

01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
could we get on
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
mr holt to come back
 
01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
and talk to us about
 
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
about what he thinks about this
 
01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:37.510 align:start position:0%
about what he thinks about this
section

01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
he's he's our only
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
link to
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
to the group that we're talking about
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
are we talking about mr simon
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
or the or the medical medical director
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
he's the administrative director of the
 
01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:58.149 align:start position:0%
he's the administrative director of the
atcs

01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
atcs
 
01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:04.709 --> 01:30:04.719 align:start position:0%
do you have a copy of the amendment uh i
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
do not i have a i have a copy of um
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
the previous amendment um
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
i think it's the same language
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
so for the people in the room the
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%

what does the department of health human
services

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh opinion on this language um
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
well i first would say uh we do there
 
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
are two atc's here in the room and they
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
may have comments as well with regard to
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
the feasibility of this
 
01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:20.629 align:start position:0%
the feasibility of this
the

01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
the number one issue that i see i would
 
01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
say there's two issues primarily one is
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't provide this language
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
does not provide a path to for-profit
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
status and it's unclear whether or not
 
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
the non-profit atc's would be allowed to
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
enter this market without being a
 
01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:37.510 align:start position:0%
enter this market without being a
for-profit

01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
for-profit
 
01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
an entity the language does say as
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
separate entities so if that is what is
 
01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:44.870 align:start position:0%
separate entities so if that is what is
intended

01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
intended
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
it's still unclear how one gets to be a
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
separate entity without a for-profit
 
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:51.910 align:start position:0%
separate entity without a for-profit
conversion

01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
conversion
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
the second issue i see here is that this
 
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
requires um a separate physical location
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
of the at of the cultivation facility um
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
which we know is a huge uh
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
well um expense so it's unclear if uh if
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
the goal here is to allow
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis to get into the state-run
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
stores they would have to build out a
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
new cultivation facility and wouldn't be
 
01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
able to use their current facilities i
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
think lastly
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
tcp would be concerned about protections
 
01:32:22.719 --> 01:32:23.430 align:start position:0%
tcp would be concerned about protections
for

01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
the the medical market
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the atcs would continue
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis for the medical market
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
i understood i i think we heard
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
testimony yes during friday it was from
 
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
from talk about maine where literally
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
the the intention of this bill was
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
that you could file a separate company
 
01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
and on
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
in your facility you could put a second
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
greenhouse we talked about yes someone
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
said that there was a main facility that
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
literally has this is the medical
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
marijuana greenhouse this is the adult
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
use greenhouse and the intention was
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
that on the same grounds but they had to
 
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
have the products separated so the idea
 
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
was to allow for that for the atc's to
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i think that i
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
understand what mr holt's saying
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
that somewhere in here it should say
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
that the the additional license is a
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
sure let me give that to ols and see if
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
they can figure a way of drafting that
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
the second parallel license will be a
 
01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:47.189 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
yeah obviously this is something they've
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
been looking for for a long time to be
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
able to do that
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
i'm correct on that correct that i know
 
01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
we talked about a marijuana commission
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
but is the issue the way the
 
01:34:04.629 --> 01:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
atc statutes are written that becomes
 
01:34:04.639 --> 01:34:06.550 align:start position:0%
atc statutes are written that becomes
problematic

01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
is there something we should be looking
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
in the atc statutes that needs to be
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
modified as well
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
if we do this
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
one and two it
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
is it it would be a violation of the
 
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
atc's statutes to
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
to because they can't they can't right
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
well guess what i'm saying right now
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
can the the atc
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
establishments cannot sell the growers
 
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
cannot sell to
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
any other recreation can't sell to
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
recreation correct
 
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
that's correct the current cannabis law
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
allows the atcs to sell to one another
 
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
only only
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
so to be able to do this we have to
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
modify the
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
those statutes as well
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
the atc statutes i think there's i think
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's quite a bit of work that needs
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
to be done in order to figure out what
 
01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:54.950 align:start position:0%
to be done in order to figure out what
actually

01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
what the mechanism would be to allow
 
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
um the atcs to enter this market uh
 
01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
including a for-profit conversion um
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
which was the subject of uh the vetoed
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
senate bill 38 from last session um
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
including you know the the specific
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to allow um
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
sale the issues of duplicate um
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
regulation overlapping regulation and
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
most importantly to the the program is
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
to ensure if an atc entered this market
 
01:35:23.669 --> 01:35:23.679 align:start position:0%
that there would still be enough
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis in cannabis products to serve
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
the medical population at their atc
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
stores so i think there's a lot of work
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
that needs to get done
 
01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:32.159 align:start position:0%
and how that
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
and how that would happen um this sets
 
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
up a framework certainly
 
01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
but i think there's a lot of details
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
that we worked out
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
and including on potential amendments to
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
the rsa 126x
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
so um i i i don't know what any of those
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
are yeah mr chair can i follow follow
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like senate bill 38 from
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
last year may have language
 
01:35:58.950 --> 01:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
that could be helpful to all us too
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
so i did specifically bring up to the
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
drafter anthony the the 126x and i was
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
concerned there were things prohibiting
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
that we might have to modify in order to
 
01:36:09.109 --> 01:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
allow this he said after review that was
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
not it was not the case this language
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
alone was all that was needed i can have
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
him re-follow it up and check again but
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
he felt that based on statute there
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't a reason there may be a rules and
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
regulation issue that has to be worked
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
out between the agencies um but by
 
01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
statute there wasn't any measure
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
i mean if it says in the atc statutes
 
01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:28.870 align:start position:0%
i mean if it says in the atc statutes
that

01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
they can't sell to uh recreational
 
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
sites that's pretty but again this is
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
going to be a separate entity so it
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the atc it would be the
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
agc's for profit organization which
 
01:36:41.189 --> 01:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
would be different a separate entity in
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
a separate condition we're not doing it
 
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
under the atc's medical license we're
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
doing it under the for-profit license
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
that is in there that's allowed by a
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
different statute
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why we also have the issue of
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
separate facilities is to make sure
 
01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:54.390 align:start position:0%
separate facilities is to make sure
again

01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
it's clear this is adult use this is
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
medical this has certain rules that has
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
different rules
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
so which is okay so what you're saying
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
then what this really does is it allows
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
a corporate structure
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
it would one on the other
 
01:37:08.639 --> 01:37:09.510 align:start position:0%
it would one on the other
yeah

01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
or is it two different corporate
 
01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:16.550 align:start position:0%
or is it two different corporate
corporations

01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
so i i would i would say it's two
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
different corporations that they can
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
apply for apparel open a get it get a
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
lice get a light you know
 
01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:25.030 align:start position:0%
lice get a light you know

atc
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
again i i i the intention of this and
 
01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:30.159 align:start position:0%
and in talking to the drafter that this
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
language would allow them to create a
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
for-profit organization apply for a
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
parallel license
 
01:37:37.109 --> 01:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
be on the same
 
01:37:37.119 --> 01:37:38.149 align:start position:0%
be on the same
um

01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better phrase physical
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
property but same street address but
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
have separate physical locations for the
 
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
for the set to separate the medical
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
marijuana from the adult use marijuana
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
and that would meet the terms and
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
conditions of both this and the atc
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
requirements roxanna abbas
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and this is
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
a question for anyone in the committee
 
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
has the atcs provided any suggested
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
language or recommendations on how to
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
draft this provision
 
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
and if they haven't i would be
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
i would urge the committee to call on
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
matt simon who is here and may have some
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
more uh detailed uh testimony regarding
 
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's pretty clear what
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
everyone's what's trying to be done here
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
the execution is where the
 
01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
problem is but i i suppose if the
 
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
atc's had any recommendation on that it
 
01:38:26.709 --> 01:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman without having
 
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
taken any look at the atc
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
statutes i don't know whether this would
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
work but as a parallel entity that's
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
self-contained and described here
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
this may be one of those places where
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
you start with the preferatory phrase
 
01:38:54.719 --> 01:38:56.830 align:start position:0%
you start with the preferatory phrase
notwithstanding

01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding
 
01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:58.390 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding
um

01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
rsa xyz
 
01:39:03.669 --> 01:39:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh the following will be allowed
 
01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
so i you know again i'm just suggesting
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
you representative spillsby
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
i mean almy
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
do we have anyone here who knows from
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
the legal side whether you can form a
 
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
for-profit corporation that would be
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
required to hand over all of its profits
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
to the non-profit which is what they
 
01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:40.550 align:start position:0%
to the non-profit which is what they
need

01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
well mr chair
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
representative i know when i know in
 
01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
massachusetts a not-for-profit can own a
 
01:39:51.679 --> 01:39:53.030 align:start position:0%
massachusetts a not-for-profit can own a
for-profit

01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
for-profit
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
but i think in new hampshire that's not
 
01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
the case
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
a for-profit can own a not-for-profit
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
it's the other way around
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
and i know that because of a company
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
that i work for that was a
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts that was and i had
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
inquired about new hampshire and it was
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
totally different it was just the other
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
way around
 
01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:14.870 align:start position:0%
way around
so

01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
that's and i don't see anybody else here
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
that has that answer so i don't know if
 
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's the correct answer i i think it
 
01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:23.030 align:start position:0%
that's the correct answer i i think it
is

01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
i guess all i know is that uh
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
this needs to be done carefully
 
01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:30.149 align:start position:0%
this needs to be done carefully
that

01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:30.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
with all respect to the drafter
 
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
using words like entities
 
01:40:39.199 --> 01:40:40.629 align:start position:0%
using words like entities
um

01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
which is in this amendment
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
and permitting an alternative treatment
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
center to make the application
 
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't
 
01:40:53.189 --> 01:40:53.199 align:start position:0%
isn't uh
 
01:40:55.109 --> 01:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
going to result in the clarity that's
 
01:40:55.119 --> 01:40:56.229 align:start position:0%
going to result in the clarity that's
needed

01:40:56.229 --> 01:40:56.239 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
i i do have the
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
the 126x statute right here
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
and uh you don't have to go beyond the
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
second line of the statute to see that
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
by definition an alternative treatment
 
01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:10.470 align:start position:0%
by definition an alternative treatment
center

01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
center
 
01:41:13.229 --> 01:41:13.239 align:start position:0%
is a non-profit not they call it a
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit entity
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
and so what we'd be writing here is that
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
an alternative treatment center which
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
means a non-profit entity
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
may file an application to obtain a
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
separate registration presumably in its
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
name it just
 
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
you know there's a logical
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
scene to me discontinuity here that
 
01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
that could is eminently fixable it just
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
requires a little more time and
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
attention and i don't know whether we
 
01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
can give it that time and attention but
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not necessarily opposed to doing
 
01:41:49.679 --> 01:41:50.470 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not necessarily opposed to doing
this

01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
i hear from the alternative treatment
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
centers that they want to do this
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
let me remind the com the committee
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
we need to get this bill out
 
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
wednesday morning
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
i was hoping
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
that we could get this bill out today
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
if it took
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
all afternoon
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh mr simons can you add anything that
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman for the record matt
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
simon representing prime atc
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
we sent this paragraph to attorneys
 
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
business law is not my area of expertise
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
at all so they've asked me some
 
01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
questions via email i'm hoping to be on
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
the phone with them this afternoon to
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
try to
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
reach some level of understanding here
 
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
as it is we have far more
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
questions and this doesn't seem
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
sufficient or adequate
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
as background
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
several states required medical cannabis
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
businesses to be non-profit and all of
 
01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
those states i believe accept new
 
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire has dropped that requirement
 
01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
and has allowed medical cannabis
 
01:42:59.910 --> 01:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
businesses to be for-profit
 
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
so senate bill 38
 
01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
created a
 
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
system for transitioning
 
01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:07.030 align:start position:0%
system for transitioning
and

01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
allowing atcs to become for-profit we've
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
suggested all along that should be
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
included in any adult use legalization
 
01:43:13.679 --> 01:43:15.189 align:start position:0%
included in any adult use legalization
bill

01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:43:17.430 --> 01:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
i don't understand how we could operate
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
two separate entities even if it's
 
01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:21.109 align:start position:0%
two separate entities even if it's
legally

01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
legally
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
viable it's hard to see it being viable
 
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
from a business perspective having to
 
01:43:28.629 --> 01:43:28.639 align:start position:0%
duplicate efforts in multiple facilities
 
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
and higher i i don't know how that would
 
01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:31.189 align:start position:0%
and higher i i don't know how that would
work

01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
we've talked about it a little bit it
 
01:43:35.590 --> 01:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
would certainly add costs as opposed to
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
states that are able to be dual use
 
01:43:41.189 --> 01:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
cultivators and manufacturers so
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
my sense is that this isn't going to
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
work and we'll need further work before
 
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
it could be workable but we're working
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative tucker
 
01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is a one solution
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
would be to
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
have this
 
01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:01.270 align:start position:0%
have this
paragraph

01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
change atc's to
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
profit-making firms speak under the mic
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
so a solution would be to eliminate the
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
non-profit status of these atc's in this
 
01:44:15.119 --> 01:44:16.070 align:start position:0%
non-profit status of these atc's in this
bill

01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
and just have them
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
turn into if if they wish to
 
01:44:21.679 --> 01:44:23.350 align:start position:0%
turn into if if they wish to
profit-making

01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
profit-making
 
01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:24.550 align:start position:0%
profit-making
groups

01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
groups
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm asking tim lang
 
01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not an attorney so right but i mean
 
01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's what you're talking about that
 
01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
has been our
 
01:44:35.109 --> 01:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
rather than going a parallel route
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
you're saying the solution here
 
01:44:41.109 --> 01:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
is not to rework a complicated topic but
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
to change this to allow changing the
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
status should they wish to
 
01:44:50.229 --> 01:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
to profit making in order to fulfill the
 
01:44:52.709 --> 01:44:52.719 align:start position:0%
sort of the trade-off
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
that they might lose some status and
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
profit or
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
cash flow and i also think it's
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
imperative for our ability to serve
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
patients and continue serving patients
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
in a way that's even remotely
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
competitive with the state-run stores
 
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
we've already heard that it'll be
 
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
tax-free cannabis and state-run stores
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
the goal is to undercut the costs of
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
neighboring states meanwhile the atcs
 
01:45:16.629 --> 01:45:16.639 align:start position:0%
are required to be vertically integrated
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
produce all of our own product we can't
 
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
buy from anybody else so patients will
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
have maybe dozens of options at the
 
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
state stores they'll only be able to buy
 
01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
products produced by prime atc or if we
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
were to buy from one of the other two
 
01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
atc's at wholesale so you're creating a
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
much more limited market for medical use
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's any way around
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
that but certainly including the
 
01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
language of sb 38 would give the atcs
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
the ability to convert for to for-profit
 
01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:43.270 align:start position:0%
the ability to convert for to for-profit
and

01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
potentially participate in both
 
01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:46.470 align:start position:0%
potentially participate in both
markets

01:45:46.470 --> 01:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
markets
 
01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:47.350 align:start position:0%
markets
and

01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
do so more effectively on both sides so
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up a follow-up so
 
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
everything i've heard about the
 
01:45:57.030 --> 01:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
medical side of
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
is really superior and that you have the
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
talk with
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
people who are users because of medical
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
reasons in a way that is more like a
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
patient relationship rather than
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
a retail store relationship so that's
 
01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
very important i think to preserve
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that the best way to
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
preserve that would be to change this
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
section six roman numeral six into the
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
ability to have a non-profit should you
 
01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:31.270 align:start position:0%
ability to have a non-profit should you
choose

01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
choose
 
01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
i mean to have a profit making should
 
01:46:34.470 --> 01:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
you choose
 
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
i believe that's correct okay so is that
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
something that uh you think could be
 
01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:39.430 align:start position:0%
something that uh you think could be
pursued

01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
pursued
 
01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:40.709 align:start position:0%
pursued
representative

01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:46:42.870 --> 01:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
so again i think there's a huge policy
 
01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:43.830 align:start position:0%
so again i think there's a huge policy
change

01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:46:47.590 --> 01:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
to making uh atc's um dispensaries
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
for-profit versus not-for-profit and i
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
think that's probably way beyond the
 
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
purview of this committee to make that
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
broad determination
 
01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
what i can do is look at again i'll go
 
01:46:57.990 --> 01:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
back to the draft and look at language
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
that talks about not notwithstanding
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
kind of language that says you know
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
excluding this chapter of law this is
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
what you're allowed to do kind of thing
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
i'll see if we can figure that out and
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
do something with that because the other
 
01:47:10.709 --> 01:47:10.719 align:start position:0%
alternative is to strike this language
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
all together and not even given the
 
01:47:14.229 --> 01:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
ability to do this uh which i'd rather
 
01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
not do i think it's a benefit to them i
 
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
think it's a benefit to the to the state
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
um i would rather not strike the
 
01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:22.470 align:start position:0%
um i would rather not strike the
language

01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
and if you know due to time constraints
 
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
we get stuck we can pass something with
 
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
the intent of what we're trying to do
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
and take over to the senate and clean it
 
01:47:31.119 --> 01:47:32.149 align:start position:0%
and take over to the senate and clean it
up

01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
where we do have more time we'll have
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
another month and a half two months to
 
01:47:35.830 --> 01:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
work on it
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
i don't like generally doing that
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
passing bad bad language over but at the
 
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
same point we pass it over with clear
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
understanding that we need to look at
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
this section otherwise we strike it we
 
01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
need to strike number six all together
 
01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
and just not give them the opportunity
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
um but i'll look at that i'll look with
 
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
the drafter and see if there's a way of
 
01:47:53.590 --> 01:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
cleaning it up to where it would it
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
would work but absent that we can just
 
01:47:57.189 --> 01:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
look at striking it and not even putting
 
01:47:59.270 --> 01:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
the opportunity in there
 
01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
it sounds like
 
01:48:01.119 --> 01:48:03.109 align:start position:0%
it sounds like
that

01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
we pass it over
 
01:48:06.550 --> 01:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
to the senate
 
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
with some language that it needs to be
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
cleared cleaned up that's what i would
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
prefer to do as the chairman again i
 
01:48:13.590 --> 01:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
just i'm we're getting back into the
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
what and the how conversation what what
 
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
is the legalization the how is how we go
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
about it um this this is a how question
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
i'd like to give the atc the opportunity
 
01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:24.149 align:start position:0%
i'd like to give the atc the opportunity
to

01:48:24.149 --> 01:48:24.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:48:26.470 --> 01:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
to sell to the state that's what this
 
01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:28.719 align:start position:0%
whole chapter this paragraph is about is
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
giving them the opportunity if we need
 
01:48:31.590 --> 01:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
to clean that up i'd rather take it over
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
the senate clean it up versus kill this
 
01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
bill right it's a policy so yeah
 
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
if i made this comment briefly
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
if the bill were to come out
 
01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
forbidding the atcs to participate in
 
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
this market
 
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
i would just argue that it's also a very
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
large policy change to license
 
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
potentially dozens or hundreds of
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
businesses that would be for-profit in a
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
space where there are already three
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
existing businesses that have to be
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
non-profit so
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
if you want to build that people are
 
01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
very unhappy with that's
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
stopped my intention that's why i put
 
01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639 align:start position:0%
the language in that's not my intention
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
so i i'd like to see it okay
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
matt matt
 
01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
so senate bill 38 did that pass both
 
01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:13.430 align:start position:0%
so senate bill 38 did that pass both
houses

01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
houses
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
yes it passed the house and senate it
 
01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
was vetoed by the governor uh it the
 
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
senate overrode the veto 19 to five
 
01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
and the house was two votes short of
 
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
that override
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the governor's veto
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
statement i believe i included in my
 
01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:29.990 align:start position:0%
statement i believe i included in my
emails

01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
emails
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
he specifically mentions the idea of
 
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
having regional for-profit monopolies
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
and the concern that if they went for
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
profit prematurely that it would give us
 
01:49:40.709 --> 01:49:40.719 align:start position:0%
an unfair head start
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
and i'm arguing that this is the
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
opposite you'd be giving hundreds of
 
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
businesses potentially an unfair head
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
start and leaving us in the dust and
 
01:49:48.239 --> 01:49:49.030 align:start position:0%
start and leaving us in the dust and
that's

01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
the governor's veto statement flipped on
 
01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
its head thank you for that that's a
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
good answer thank you
 
01:49:54.639 --> 01:49:58.149 align:start position:0%
good answer thank you
representative

01:49:58.149 --> 01:49:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm not uh
 
01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know what
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
what the house would do this year since
 
01:50:08.790 --> 01:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
was that wasn't last year was it was the
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
year before
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
it was vetoed in august and the
 
01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
the votes were in january
 
01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
okay so so we've got the same people
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
we have an almost two-thirds in the
 
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
house we have a two-thirds in the senate
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
that went along with this
 
01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
this solution
 
01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
except the governor and the governor
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
vetoed it because
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
we didn't have
 
01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
marijuana legalization i don't see
 
01:50:39.599 --> 01:50:41.270 align:start position:0%
marijuana legalization i don't see
that

01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
why we can't include that bill
 
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
or the operative parts of it into this
 
01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:49.910 align:start position:0%
or the operative parts of it into this
bill

01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
and have it go forward since the
 
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
governor's on object if the governor is
 
01:50:58.390 --> 01:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
willing to sign legalization he should
 
01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
be willing to sign this part of it
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:51:05.589 --> 01:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
i mr chair if i may i just be concerned
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
that we start going the non-germane
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
areas if we open up all kind if we
 
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
change the atc's and try to do that to
 
01:51:14.229 --> 01:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
make them all for profit the
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
either the speaker or someone may argue
 
01:51:17.669 --> 01:51:17.679 align:start position:0%
that it's a non-german amendment not
 
01:51:19.350 --> 01:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
that wasn't included in the original
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill to go start changing 126 and so i'm
 
01:51:24.149 --> 01:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
a little bit nervous about that um that
 
01:51:26.070 --> 01:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
we get it killed for some other stupid
 
01:51:27.990 --> 01:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
reason when we have a path forward right
 
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:31.350 align:start position:0%
reason when we have a path forward right
here

01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
we're not going to
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
solve this right now
 
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
so we have to make a decision
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
do we make a small tweak on this and
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
move forward i will mr chairman
 
01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
i will mr chair okay
 
01:51:46.709 --> 01:51:46.719 align:start position:0%
the other thing is uh we have somebody
 
01:51:48.629 --> 01:51:48.639 align:start position:0%
from the bankers association who wants
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you um for the record ryan
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
hale vice president government relations
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire bankers um while this
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
is not a banking issue we just thought
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
that might be helpful for the committee
 
01:52:15.189 --> 01:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
we as an association are non-profit but
 
01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
we do operate a for-profit
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
we thought that might be helpful for the
 
01:52:21.669 --> 01:52:21.679 align:start position:0%
for the committee
 
01:52:21.679 --> 01:52:22.709 align:start position:0%
for the committee
okay

01:52:22.709 --> 01:52:22.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.070 --> 01:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
short of counting on the thank you mr
 
01:52:32.709 --> 01:52:32.719 align:start position:0%
chair sure coming i i would agree and
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
suggest that we strike section six
 
01:52:35.679 --> 01:52:36.470 align:start position:0%
suggest that we strike section six
the

01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
the suppliers that we're trying to
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
include here can apply like any other
 
01:52:44.709 --> 01:52:44.719 align:start position:0%
entity that wants to be a cultivator
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay and we lose this headache
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
i'll do mr joe i'll just take i'll take
 
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
on the tweaks that that of trying to
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
make the language work because i do
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
think we want to be fair to the atcs and
 
01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
not give them an undue delay in this
 
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
process and i'll just bring it i'll
 
01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
bring it to the committee and we can
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
decide i am nervous about either we have
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
to strike the language because i don't i
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
don't think we should go deep into 126
 
01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
and try to change chapters of law
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
they're not already brought up in this
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
in this bill and specifics like making
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
atc's for-profit organizations so i i
 
01:53:24.070 --> 01:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
rather not do that but i'd rather do
 
01:53:25.750 --> 01:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
just kind of tweak the language we have
 
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
and we can move over to the senate and
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
then if they want to add it it'll follow
 
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
the senate process and they have every
 
01:53:32.550 --> 01:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
right to add the 126 language to make
 
01:53:35.669 --> 01:53:35.679 align:start position:0%
atc's profits from senate bill 38.
 
01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
represent abbas
 
01:53:38.830 --> 01:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
chairman when i first introduced the
 
01:53:41.119 --> 01:53:41.910 align:start position:0%
chairman when i first introduced the
bill

01:53:41.910 --> 01:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
a few weeks ago
 
01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
i was i'm supportive of having some type
 
01:53:48.149 --> 01:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
of partnership with the atcs
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
but it's it's a complicated integration
 
01:53:53.109 --> 01:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
and i would say that without having any
 
01:53:55.830 --> 01:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
suggestions or even suggested language
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
it makes that partnership
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
and i i understand that a lot of people
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
are concerned about
 
01:54:05.189 --> 01:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
what potential negative impact 1598
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
would have on the
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
atc's there been any information
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
presented to the committee about the
 
01:54:13.030 --> 01:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
percentage of
 
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
customers that the atcs would
 
01:54:17.109 --> 01:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
potentially lose
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
to if there was a retail
 
01:54:22.229 --> 01:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
canvas store and i guess what was the
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
basis of arriving at that conclusion and
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
the other question really is
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know how much a percentage of the
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
sales would the atc's have to lose
 
01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
before their viability actually came
 
01:54:31.119 --> 01:54:32.149 align:start position:0%
before their viability actually came
into

01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
question i'm not sure if that was
 
01:54:36.229 --> 01:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
provided to me i understand that there
 
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
may be a competing market share to some
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
degree but
 
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
i'm just without seeing the the business
 
01:54:44.070 --> 01:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
model itself i wouldn't know
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
the details of that
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
we don't know and we don't have the time
 
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
to find
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
the administrator of the atc
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
he doesn't have the answer so mr i think
 
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
probably the important thing we heard
 
01:55:01.830 --> 01:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
was from the banking industry that you
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
could have a not-for-profit entity that
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
also owns a for-profit entity and i was
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
thinking of concrete capital region
 
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
healthcare when i worked for them we had
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
some medical practices we owned that
 
01:55:12.550 --> 01:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
were for-profit medical practices that
 
01:55:14.070 --> 01:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
were owned by capital region healthcare
 
01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
so i know
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
you can do that there are some tax
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
implications of those kind of things but
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
i also realize we can do that
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
i think we need to move on thank you
 
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
so next comes the fun the real reason
 
01:55:27.589 --> 01:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
ways and means is here we're talking
 
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
about disbursement of funds and
 
01:55:30.310 --> 01:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
collection of funds and what that looks
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
like we're still on page sorry where am
 
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
i here
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh we moved on from page seven
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
there's no changes in the rest of that
 
01:55:41.830 --> 01:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
page and we move on to page eight
 
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
um on page eight the first thing the
 
01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
first changes that were made as part of
 
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
the amendments was the banking language
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
which i presented to you guys last week
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
um it said it starts on pay uh page 8
 
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
line 18
 
01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
and mainly we talk about just some
 
01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
financial protections and like the
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
monies that that the uh the funds shall
 
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
be kept distinct and separate from all
 
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
the other funds in the state treasury
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
and the monies credited to the fund
 
01:56:06.550 --> 01:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
shall be held distinct and separate from
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
all other funds over which the state
 
01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
treasurer has control monies in the fund
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
shall be deposited in a financial
 
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
institution as defined by the rsa with a
 
01:56:16.229 --> 01:56:16.239 align:start position:0%
branch in a state so again this is just
 
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
some financial protections we put into
 
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
to protect the state in case the federal
 
01:56:22.070 --> 01:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
government comes in we didn't want
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
liquor to intermix cannabis money with
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
liquor money and then have the state the
 
01:56:27.430 --> 01:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
feds come in and decide they're going to
 
01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
take all of our money and and so it was
 
01:56:31.589 --> 01:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of protections put
 
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:37.210 align:start position:0%
then we get down to
 
01:56:37.210 --> 01:56:39.910 align:start position:0%
then we get down to
[Music]

01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
line 32 which is where we start talking
 
01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
about disbursement of the money
 
01:56:45.910 --> 01:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh the revenues that do come in from the
 
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis fund and deposit into the
 
01:56:49.109 --> 01:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
cannabis fund
 
01:56:49.119 --> 01:56:49.990 align:start position:0%
cannabis fund
um

01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
as i said on friday the first thing this
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
amendment does is i inverted um the um
 
01:56:58.709 --> 01:56:58.719 align:start position:0%
payback to the citizens
 
01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
with the operational expenses for the uh
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
agency in other words the agency has to
 
01:57:04.709 --> 01:57:04.719 align:start position:0%
be able to operate first and then we
 
01:57:07.109 --> 01:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
start paying back the citizens um the
 
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
4.6 million dollars i also put um
 
01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
a deadline in number four for the
 
01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
payback so number number three on line
 
01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:17.030 align:start position:0%
payback so number number three on line
32

01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
32
 
01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
is um the administration allowing them
 
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
to take the administration out of the 30
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:57:25.510 --> 01:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
and then number four is the payback and
 
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
i gave them a five-year payback with the
 
01:57:29.669 --> 01:57:29.679 align:start position:0%
idea being that the first three years
 
01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to be in a pretty
 
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
significant growth mode and then the
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
second two years they should have enough
 
01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
revenue coming in that to be able to pay
 
01:57:39.189 --> 01:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
our citizens the 4.2 4.6 million dollar
 
01:57:42.070 --> 01:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
startup costs that we allocated for them
 
01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
any questions on
 
01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
moving on to page 9. this is where we
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
start talking about the net net revenues
 
01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
meaning that after we've taken out the
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
costs and after we've paid back the
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
citizens how much money is left and what
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
are we going to do with that money
 
01:57:57.119 --> 01:57:59.109 align:start position:0%
are we going to do with that money
um

01:57:59.109 --> 01:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to run through it i'm
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
hoping i get through the the five
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
sections that are here about how the
 
01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
money's dispersed and then we'll have a
 
01:58:07.109 --> 01:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
big just a conversation in general about
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
disbursement so the first one is 50 will
 
01:58:11.589 --> 01:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
be sent to the department of revenue to
 
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
offset swept property tax
 
01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
so the so as explained i think on friday
 
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
currently by statute we have to raise
 
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
363 million dollars
 
01:58:24.550 --> 01:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
um to for swept and that's what that's
 
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
the direct taxation we do to our
 
01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:27.669 align:start position:0%
the direct taxation we do to our
citizens

01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:27.679 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
um if we're going to do this i felt we
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
need to give our citizens a good reason
 
01:58:32.790 --> 01:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
why we're doing this and one of the and
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
the swept property tax reduction was one
 
01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
of the ways
 
01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
um in that um
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
if we raised 363 million dollars and 50
 
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
percent of the money we got was 10
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars we would then only have
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
to raise 353 million dollars from our
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
citizens we directly offset the
 
01:58:51.589 --> 01:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
statutory obligation uh the 363 million
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
which would result in a
 
01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
the line item on your property tax bill
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
it says statewide education property tax
 
01:58:58.229 --> 01:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
being lowered
 
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
for every citizen every taxpayer so
 
01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's the first one first disbursement
 
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
the second disbursement is um 30
 
01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
of the remain of that net net
 
01:59:10.950 --> 01:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
is uh going to
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
reduce the
 
01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:13.350 align:start position:0%
reduce the
um

01:59:13.350 --> 01:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:15.270 --> 01:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire retirement system debt we
 
01:59:16.629 --> 01:59:16.639 align:start position:0%
certainly have a we currently have a
 
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
debt of i believe it's around 6 billion
 
01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
that the state owes to the retirement
 
01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:23.109 align:start position:0%
that the state owes to the retirement
system

01:59:23.109 --> 01:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:59:25.270 --> 01:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
the idea is we would help
 
01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
hasten that pay down
 
01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
by hastening that pay down this will
 
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
directly affect towns once it's paid off
 
01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
so the faster we can get it paid off the
 
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
faster all of our towns and our
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
communities will be benefited because
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
our rate that we charge the towns is
 
01:59:40.629 --> 01:59:40.639 align:start position:0%
increased because we have to pay the
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
debt off so once we pay the debt off
 
01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
that percentage we need to collect from
 
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
the towns
 
01:59:46.950 --> 01:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
will be less
 
01:59:49.189 --> 01:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
and to the employ to every single state
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
employee the number will be less so the
 
01:59:52.629 --> 01:59:52.639 align:start position:0%
percentage that's charged as the to the
 
01:59:53.990 --> 01:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
retirement system for them for their
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
retirement would go down which means
 
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
that every single state employee would
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
basically see a pay raise beyond just
 
02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
debts paid off so the faster we can do
 
02:00:02.070 --> 02:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
it the better it is for everybody we pay
 
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
less interest on the on the funds so
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's why that line was added in there
 
02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:10.229 align:start position:0%
that's why that line was added in there
question

02:00:10.229 --> 02:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:15.669 --> 02:00:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
when you mention the state employees is
 
02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
that a negotiated uh
 
02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:21.109 align:start position:0%
that a negotiated uh
retirement

02:00:21.109 --> 02:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
percentage they have to pay in
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
so it's not negotiated it's part of the
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
retirement systems when they do their
 
02:00:28.709 --> 02:00:28.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal audit and maybe somebody from
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal could answer this question better
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
than me or edna ran this language by the
 
02:00:34.950 --> 02:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
chairman of edna and they said with this
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
one piece of language we got every
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
committee vote from over in edna because
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:47.109 --> 02:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
the next one is 10
 
02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
um or
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
25 million dollars whichever is less to
 
02:00:52.229 --> 02:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
be credited the department of health and
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
human services for drug and alcohol
 
02:00:56.070 --> 02:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
services for use for evidence-based
 
02:00:58.390 --> 02:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
voluntary programs for substance abuse
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
so again we the idea is as the program
 
02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
ramps up in theory there are more and
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
more citizens using it in theory dhhs
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
needs more and more money to deal with
 
02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
more and more citizens so we we did a a
 
02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
10 number rather than a hard number um a
 
02:01:15.270 --> 02:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
best especially with a hard number of 25
 
02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars because we don't even
 
02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
think the program's gonna make that in
 
02:01:20.629 --> 02:01:20.639 align:start position:0%
the first year so it automatically get
 
02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
you know we bankrupt the money so the
 
02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
agency so by using a percentage and
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
allowing it allows as the agent as it
 
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
grows to go in there i will send i
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
apologize i think i said i was gonna do
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
this on friday but i'll do it before i
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
leave i do have an email from dhhs about
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
all their other cessation programs
 
02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719 align:start position:0%
remember as part of the opioid crisis
 
02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
and the settlement there's some money
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to go into the cessation
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
program there's a significant amount of
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
money that goes into the cessation drug
 
02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
and alcohol association programs from
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
liquor money as well
 
02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
i did have the disbursement uh i i asked
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
liquor i asked dhhs to give me on all
 
02:01:56.310 --> 02:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
your alcohol and drug cessation programs
 
02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
what are your source of revenues what is
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
the expenditures you've made how many
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
citizens have you helped and i'll
 
02:02:02.709 --> 02:02:02.719 align:start position:0%
distribute that out to all the committee
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
members so you have it
 
02:02:08.470 --> 02:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
after that we put five percent remaining
 
02:02:09.990 --> 02:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
to disbursement of public safety
 
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
agencies including police fire and
 
02:02:13.030 --> 02:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
rescue agents for the hiring and
 
02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
training of additional drug recognition
 
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
experts so again this is money that
 
02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
would go to law enforcement and first
 
02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
responders to help with any any
 
02:02:23.589 --> 02:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
implications that re
 
02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
result out of this and i use the example
 
02:02:27.669 --> 02:02:27.679 align:start position:0%
of this is when i was a police officer i
 
02:02:29.189 --> 02:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
was a dre i was a drug recognition
 
02:02:29.199 --> 02:02:30.470 align:start position:0%
was a dre i was a drug recognition
expert

02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
expert
 
02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
and it made it so that if i stop
 
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
somebody which i have for driving when i
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
thought they were drunk and it turned
 
02:02:37.189 --> 02:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
out they were they were actually it
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
wasn't alcohol it was a drug related um
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
stop and an impairment
 
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
it gives cops tools to be able to better
 
02:02:46.229 --> 02:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
articulate in their police reports to be
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
able to get convictions better so they
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what they're looking
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
for and how to articulate what they
 
02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:52.470 align:start position:0%
for and how to articulate what they
found

02:02:52.470 --> 02:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
found
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
better to allow us to be able to get
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
convictions on these things
 
02:02:59.030 --> 02:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
so um so again there's there's language
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
in there to give law enforcement and
 
02:03:02.070 --> 02:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
first responders the training they need
 
02:03:03.669 --> 02:03:03.679 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
02:03:05.669 --> 02:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
deal with our drunk dr drugged and drunk
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
driving issues better
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
the last one um maybe representative
 
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
abbas can answer why this year but it's
 
02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
in here was asked and i agreed i agreed
 
02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
with it this five percent remaining will
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
be dispersed to the department of health
 
02:03:18.310 --> 02:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
and human services division of
 
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
behavioral health bureau of child
 
02:03:21.589 --> 02:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
behavioral health to be used for
 
02:03:23.669 --> 02:03:23.679 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral health services so
 
02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:25.679 align:start position:0%
again there are implications and i'm
 
02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
guessing this goes back to
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
the to 10 we're just talking about the
 
02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
substance abuse issues there are related
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
issues with families that have issues
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
and this would be able to help those
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
families and the children of those
 
02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:37.750 align:start position:0%
families and the children of those
families

02:03:37.750 --> 02:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
families
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
so that's the money disbursement so now
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
we can have that conversation
 
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
okay we have two members from the
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
finance committee sitting with us today
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:27.189 --> 02:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
yes the uh
 
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
current liability is 4.99 billion
 
02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
and which was you know i mean it's it's
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
been up to 5.4 when we changed it in
 
02:04:37.199 --> 02:04:38.870 align:start position:0%
been up to 5.4 when we changed it in
2011

02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
2011
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
when uh it uh
 
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
we we've been reducing it but the people
 
02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
that are currently on retirement and
 
02:04:45.199 --> 02:04:46.149 align:start position:0%
that are currently on retirement and
those

02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
shortly because our our workforce is
 
02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:49.750 align:start position:0%
shortly because our our workforce is
obviously

02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
02:04:52.149 --> 02:04:52.159 align:start position:0%
aging out and uh that's going to come
 
02:04:54.149 --> 02:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
due here very quickly
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
so that's it's important we get that
 
02:04:58.149 --> 02:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
under control
 
02:04:58.159 --> 02:04:59.990 align:start position:0%
under control
uh

02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
i think that's about it uh
 
02:05:02.639 --> 02:05:03.910 align:start position:0%
i think that's about it uh
yeah

02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:04.790 align:start position:0%
yeah
that's

02:05:04.790 --> 02:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:05:08.709 --> 02:05:08.719 align:start position:0%
in hats you have any comments um
 
02:05:12.790 --> 02:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair though um
 
02:05:15.189 --> 02:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
the mannerism in what some of these
 
02:05:16.390 --> 02:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
items are being
 
02:05:18.550 --> 02:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
funded as well without is not without
 
02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:20.390 align:start position:0%
funded as well without is not without
precedence

02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
precedence
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
for example the alcohol fund
 
02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
when it was established
 
02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
there was to be a certain percentage i
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
think it was
 
02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
of alcohol
 
02:05:35.189 --> 02:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
state liquor store revenues to be
 
02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
dedicated to alcohol and drug abuse
 
02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:40.390 align:start position:0%
dedicated to alcohol and drug abuse
mitigation

02:05:40.390 --> 02:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
mitigation
 
02:05:43.750 --> 02:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
though we went many decades without
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
sending them any money
 
02:05:47.189 --> 02:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
that was
 
02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
the methodology used for funding
 
02:05:52.069 --> 02:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
that type of activity
 
02:05:54.629 --> 02:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
my only concern is and and it may or may
 
02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
not be unfounded is i'm looking at the
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%
specific amounts
 
02:06:01.750 --> 02:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
and how much is there for example the 25
 
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
million that caught my eye
 
02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
um without any knowledge of
 
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
what's planned what's being done and i
 
02:06:12.390 --> 02:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
guess representative lang asked hhs for
 
02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
what's currently in place
 
02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
and we i know we're short of time in the
 
02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
dynamics of this it could change in the
 
02:06:24.229 --> 02:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
senate um i'm just not comfortable with
 
02:06:25.990 --> 02:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
the amounts without
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
a little more information and whether
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
there's time or not to have that
 
02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
hard to say
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
have asked hhs for some information john
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
has has given us some
 
02:06:36.719 --> 02:06:37.430 align:start position:0%
has has given us some
but

02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
today his only response or hhs only
 
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
response is they
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
they really didn't request the funds um
 
02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:51.830 align:start position:0%
they really didn't request the funds um
they're

02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
aware that they are in the
 
02:06:56.470 --> 02:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
bill but they have no input on to what's
 
02:06:59.109 --> 02:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate how much is needed and what
 
02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
should be done and i'm i'm just
 
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
we're you're marking a considerable
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
amount and a considerable percentage
 
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
percentage and i'm just not sure
 
02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
that may be very perfect but that's not
 
02:07:11.910 --> 02:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
how we normally do things and i'm just
 
02:07:13.669 --> 02:07:13.679 align:start position:0%
not sure that's a good idea
 
02:07:15.189 --> 02:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hatch and
 
02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
further questions representative elmi
 
02:07:19.350 --> 02:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:20.709 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
on

02:07:20.709 --> 02:07:20.719 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking i believe about
 
02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:24.069 align:start position:0%
you're talking i believe about
the

02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:26.069 --> 02:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
ten percent
 
02:07:26.079 --> 02:07:26.870 align:start position:0%
ten percent
on

02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
for quite a long time to come
 
02:07:32.709 --> 02:07:32.719 align:start position:0%
that's going to be three million dollars
 
02:07:34.629 --> 02:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
a year
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
but it does seem there is a
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
program already in
 
02:07:45.270 --> 02:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
hhs uh in
 
02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
the bureau of drug and alcohol services
 
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:07:56.069 --> 02:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
that is supposed to be
 
02:07:56.079 --> 02:07:57.430 align:start position:0%
that is supposed to be
providing

02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
providing
 
02:07:59.669 --> 02:07:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh this kind of help for addiction and
 
02:08:01.830 --> 02:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
 
02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
on we
 
02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
it probably
 
02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:06.069 align:start position:0%
it probably
if

02:08:06.069 --> 02:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
mr holt knows what the name of that
 
02:08:10.870 --> 02:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
program is it probably should be just
 
02:08:13.109 --> 02:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
put in there
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
to add to the little bit of money that
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
we feed into addiction work
 
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
from various sources we've done it a few
 
02:08:25.750 --> 02:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
times with gambling bills we've
 
02:08:32.550 --> 02:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:34.069 align:start position:0%
 
on

02:08:34.069 --> 02:08:34.079 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
page nine on i believe that that
 
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative hatch was talking about
 
02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:40.629 align:start position:0%
representative hatch was talking about
the

02:08:40.629 --> 02:08:40.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:40.639 --> 02:08:41.669 align:start position:0%
the
10

02:08:41.669 --> 02:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
10
 
02:08:45.270 --> 02:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
or 25 million dollars whichever is less
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
credited to the department of health and
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
human services
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:59.669 --> 02:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:59.679 --> 02:09:01.189 align:start position:0%
 
actually

02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:09:01.199 --> 02:09:02.069 align:start position:0%
actually
uh

02:09:02.069 --> 02:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman uh one of the
 
02:09:09.669 --> 02:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
things that
 
02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative lang pointed out was the
 
02:09:13.189 --> 02:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
swept tax
 
02:09:14.950 --> 02:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
if you remember earlier in the year we
 
02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
voted on to reduce the swept tax by a
 
02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars
 
02:09:21.030 --> 02:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
which goes directly against property
 
02:09:22.709 --> 02:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
taxes which is a big problem in the
 
02:09:24.229 --> 02:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
state so this
 
02:09:26.390 --> 02:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
this is going to uh
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
parallel that uh effort
 
02:09:31.030 --> 02:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh that's only for that hundred million
 
02:09:33.589 --> 02:09:33.599 align:start position:0%
dollar uh
 
02:09:36.550 --> 02:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
that that is only for this year uh
 
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be paid uh for
 
02:09:40.149 --> 02:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
anyone who wants to know is uh with part
 
02:09:45.060 --> 02:09:45.070 align:start position:0%
of adequacy in the fall to the schools
 
02:09:45.070 --> 02:09:48.390 align:start position:0%
of adequacy in the fall to the schools
[Music]

02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:50.069 --> 02:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
so again
 
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
to that point on what representative um
 
02:09:54.550 --> 02:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
petrie was just talking about again this
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
was the hundred million dollars was a
 
02:09:58.310 --> 02:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
one-time ex one-time expenditure and so
 
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
the goal here is to if we're going to do
 
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
something for the purpose of the
 
02:10:04.149 --> 02:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
citizens let's provide a permanent
 
02:10:06.870 --> 02:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
path of relief for them as well so this
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
creates a funding source settle annually
 
02:10:10.550 --> 02:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
while it may be variable and with the
 
02:10:12.149 --> 02:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
with with all good luck it's going to go
 
02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
up year over year that'll allow for a
 
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
slow reduction of the required property
 
02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
tax to be collected by our citizens
 
02:10:20.069 --> 02:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
under this swept line on your property
 
02:10:21.189 --> 02:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
tax bill
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
so it gives a funding source whereas the
 
02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
other funding source was just because we
 
02:10:33.910 --> 02:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
well the first thing i want to say is i
 
02:10:38.709 --> 02:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
think it's foolhardy to have a list like
 
02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
this in a
 
02:10:43.589 --> 02:10:43.599 align:start position:0%
piece of general legislation where we're
 
02:10:47.350 --> 02:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
we're allocating uh by percentage
 
02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:48.629 align:start position:0%
we're allocating uh by percentage
uh

02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
potentially substantial amounts of money
 
02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:52.550 align:start position:0%
potentially substantial amounts of money
to

02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:10:54.149 --> 02:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
what uh
 
02:10:56.550 --> 02:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
at this moment in time or favored by the
 
02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
majority of
 
02:11:00.629 --> 02:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
of a committee or of the house or at the
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
house and senate
 
02:11:04.069 --> 02:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh this this is what we have a budget
 
02:11:06.629 --> 02:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
process for this is uh
 
02:11:09.109 --> 02:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
the budget process is designed to sort
 
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
out needs against uh revenues and
 
02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
here we're trying to lasso to
 
02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:16.870 align:start position:0%
here we're trying to lasso to
capture

02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
capture
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh what could be 30 million or or it
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
could be 100 million dollars
 
02:11:25.030 --> 02:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
and steer it into
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
several several different categories
 
02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
maybe five or six i don't have the count
 
02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:30.470 align:start position:0%
maybe five or six i don't have the count
here

02:11:30.470 --> 02:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
so that's my first point i just think
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's foolhardy and
 
02:11:36.629 --> 02:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't do it i i would
 
02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
say that the bill that came to us had
 
02:11:41.189 --> 02:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
one favored category
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
up front and that was a category that
 
02:11:46.390 --> 02:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
directly related to what this
 
02:11:48.790 --> 02:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
bill was concerned with addressing which
 
02:11:52.149 --> 02:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
was cannabis and the use of cannabis and
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
maybe more generally the use of
 
02:11:57.350 --> 02:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
drugs that can be addictive
 
02:11:57.360 --> 02:11:58.149 align:start position:0%
drugs that can be addictive
and

02:11:58.149 --> 02:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:59.589 --> 02:11:59.599 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
the bill that came to us
 
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
has a 25 million dollar
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
up front uh allocation
 
02:12:10.550 --> 02:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
and it's only after that
 
02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:11.830 align:start position:0%
and it's only after that
that

02:12:11.830 --> 02:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:14.229 --> 02:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
that there are allocations to other
 
02:12:14.239 --> 02:12:15.350 align:start position:0%
that there are allocations to other
needs

02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
needs
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
that priority makes sense to me
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of thing that should be
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
a bill like this that's the way the
 
02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund was done
 
02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:25.599 align:start position:0%
uh up front there was an allocation a
 
02:12:27.109 --> 02:12:27.119 align:start position:0%
draw from
 
02:12:27.119 --> 02:12:27.910 align:start position:0%
draw from
from

02:12:27.910 --> 02:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:29.189 align:start position:0%
from
the

02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
source of the alcohol fund
 
02:12:34.709 --> 02:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
for a specific need that related
 
02:12:34.719 --> 02:12:35.910 align:start position:0%
for a specific need that related
to

02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:37.830 align:start position:0%
to
alcohol

02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:39.430 align:start position:0%
alcohol
so

02:12:39.430 --> 02:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:43.109 --> 02:12:43.119 align:start position:0%
25 million dollars or less or more that
 
02:12:44.950 --> 02:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
that makes sense to me but the rest of
 
02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:45.589 align:start position:0%
that makes sense to me but the rest of
it

02:12:45.589 --> 02:12:45.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:12:47.430 --> 02:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
does not i would put the rest of it
 
02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:48.550 align:start position:0%
does not i would put the rest of it
myself

02:12:48.550 --> 02:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
myself
 
02:12:51.189 --> 02:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
into the general fund or the education
 
02:12:52.950 --> 02:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
trust fund take your
 
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
take your pick
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's the way i would do it with regard
 
02:12:58.709 --> 02:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
swept i would simply put
 
02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
point out
 
02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
that when you allocate money when you
 
02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
send money out
 
02:13:08.149 --> 02:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh in effect
 
02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
to replace
 
02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
i guess that's how you do it to replace
 
02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:14.550 align:start position:0%
i guess that's how you do it to replace
uh

02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:17.350 --> 02:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
funds that are currently
 
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
derived from the swept
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
you're sending it
 
02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:22.229 align:start position:0%
you're sending it
out

02:13:22.229 --> 02:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
in a way that will be inversely
 
02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.589 align:start position:0%
in a way that will be inversely
proportional

02:13:25.589 --> 02:13:25.599 align:start position:0%
proportional
 
02:13:28.629 --> 02:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
almost directly to the property wealth
 
02:13:28.639 --> 02:13:29.669 align:start position:0%
almost directly to the property wealth
of

02:13:29.669 --> 02:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:13:31.109 --> 02:13:31.119 align:start position:0%
each town
 
02:13:33.589 --> 02:13:33.599 align:start position:0%
the wealthiest town will get the biggest
 
02:13:35.109 --> 02:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
dollar amount
 
02:13:37.270 --> 02:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
which will then be applied to their
 
02:13:38.550 --> 02:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
school budget
 
02:13:42.870 --> 02:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
which means that uh that town will be
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
benefiting substantially more
 
02:13:48.390 --> 02:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
than the poorest down whether it's
 
02:13:50.310 --> 02:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
i said i see my friend over there
 
02:13:52.310 --> 02:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
charlestown which is either one or two
 
02:13:53.750 --> 02:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
at the bottom
 
02:13:56.950 --> 02:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
or claremont next door to charlestown
 
02:13:59.189 --> 02:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh and on the other end of it we'll have
 
02:14:00.790 --> 02:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
portsmouth or
 
02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
mirai or uh maltenborough i
 
02:14:06.470 --> 02:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
hate to pick out towns but
 
02:14:07.589 --> 02:14:07.599 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
02:14:09.030 --> 02:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
we're where the differences are
 
02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:10.629 align:start position:0%
we're where the differences are
extraordinary

02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
extraordinary
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
and so you'll be spending sending much
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
more dollars much more in the way of
 
02:14:15.599 --> 02:14:16.790 align:start position:0%
more dollars much more in the way of
dollars

02:14:16.790 --> 02:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
in effect back through the budgeting
 
02:14:21.350 --> 02:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
process at the local level the school
 
02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
funding project process
 
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
and i i doesn't make sense to me frankly
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh i can understand cutting the swept
 
02:14:31.990 --> 02:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
rate at
 
02:14:34.470 --> 02:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
a general level that
 
02:14:36.790 --> 02:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's uh something we could discuss but
 
02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:37.510 align:start position:0%
that's uh something we could discuss but
uh

02:14:37.510 --> 02:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:38.830 --> 02:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
in effect
 
02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:14:52.550 --> 02:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make sense to me so those
 
02:14:56.470 --> 02:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
are three different points
 
02:14:59.350 --> 02:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh and uh those are my uh
 
02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
feelings that as drafted i i i don't see
 
02:15:04.550 --> 02:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
how i could support this
 
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:07.270 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
representative

02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:15:09.109 --> 02:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you so you know representatives
 
02:15:10.709 --> 02:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments i i actually
 
02:15:12.069 --> 02:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
thought long and hard over this over the
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
weekend that conversation i guess the
 
02:15:15.910 --> 02:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
way i looked at it was this
 
02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:17.510 align:start position:0%
way i looked at it was this
was

02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:15:19.750 --> 02:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is your your your swept
 
02:15:21.270 --> 02:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
tax rate
 
02:15:22.629 --> 02:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
is based on the amount of money that
 
02:15:24.310 --> 02:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
needs to be raised by the state so if
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
it's 363 million dollars it's 363
 
02:15:29.430 --> 02:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars divided by the total
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
evaluation of the state gives you the
 
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
per thousand costs that we're gonna have
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
to raise for taxation now if you own if
 
02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
if the savings by this is a penny per
 
02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:39.589 align:start position:0%
if the savings by this is a penny per
thousand

02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
and you own a hundred thousand dollar
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
house you're going to save a hundred
 
02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
dollars under
 
02:15:46.629 --> 02:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess a hundred dollars on your
 
02:15:47.669 --> 02:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
tax bill
 
02:15:49.750 --> 02:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
if you own um
 
02:15:52.709 --> 02:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
a 300 000 house yes you're gonna get
 
02:15:54.629 --> 02:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
three times the savings your tax is
 
02:15:56.229 --> 02:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
going to be lower but it's the same
 
02:15:58.709 --> 02:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
percentage of per thousand cost
 
02:16:00.470 --> 02:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
and that's how the swept property tax
 
02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
works so this fairly well while i
 
02:16:04.709 --> 02:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
understand he's
 
02:16:07.270 --> 02:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
conflicting towns with taxpayers and i'm
 
02:16:09.910 --> 02:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
talking about taxpayers right every
 
02:16:12.470 --> 02:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayer will see a reduction
 
02:16:14.470 --> 02:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
on this on this model
 
02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:15.350 align:start position:0%
on this on this model
so

02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
the the amount of taxes collected by the
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
town will be different right so again if
 
02:16:24.069 --> 02:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
if this greek creates a reduction of a
 
02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
penny in the tax rate
 
02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:26.629 align:start position:0%
penny in the tax rate
then

02:16:26.629 --> 02:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:16:28.310 --> 02:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
every citizen will see a penny reduction
 
02:16:30.229 --> 02:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
in that tax rate it doesn't matter
 
02:16:31.589 --> 02:16:31.599 align:start position:0%
whether you're from a rich town or a
 
02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
port town the individual taxpayer is
 
02:16:36.070 --> 02:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
going to see a reduction and again if i
 
02:16:38.389 --> 02:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
was looking at this as going forward and
 
02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
we know from every one of us when we go
 
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
to a public setting then probably the
 
02:16:45.910 --> 02:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
number one thing we hear about is taxes
 
02:16:47.429 --> 02:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
how are you lowering my property taxes
 
02:16:48.549 --> 02:16:48.559 align:start position:0%
what are you doing to lowering my
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
property tax so here's an opportunity
 
02:16:52.709 --> 02:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
for us to do a permanent solution for
 
02:16:54.549 --> 02:16:54.559 align:start position:0%
lowering property taxes by creating a
 
02:16:56.549 --> 02:16:56.559 align:start position:0%
revenue stream that will lower the
 
02:16:58.070 --> 02:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
amount of money that the state has to
 
02:16:59.830 --> 02:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
collect from every single property owner
 
02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
in the state so that's the reason i did
 
02:17:04.790 --> 02:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
it i i i don't unders i don't want to
 
02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:06.070 align:start position:0%
it i i i don't unders i don't want to
confuse

02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
confuse
 
02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayer in towns we're talking about
 
02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers right this individual citizen
 
02:17:13.429 --> 02:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
not the governmental organization right
 
02:17:15.750 --> 02:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
every individual citizen who owns
 
02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
property in the state of new hampshire
 
02:17:19.110 --> 02:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
will see their rate for the swept go
 
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
down because we're providing a direct
 
02:17:23.030 --> 02:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
funding source
 
02:17:25.030 --> 02:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
to reduce the amount of money we're
 
02:17:31.589 --> 02:17:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:34.709 --> 02:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
representing ames then i'm going to let
 
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
go just be brief but
 
02:17:39.830 --> 02:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
for the taxpayers
 
02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer has two lines on his or her
 
02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:44.469 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer has two lines on his or her
bill

02:17:44.469 --> 02:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:17:47.509 --> 02:17:47.519 align:start position:0%
one is the local school tax and the
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
other is the swept tax
 
02:17:51.509 --> 02:17:51.519 align:start position:0%
the school district that the town is
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
part of
 
02:17:56.469 --> 02:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
develops its budget and then applies it
 
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
and gets revenue for it
 
02:18:02.709 --> 02:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
by looking to both of those sources
 
02:18:05.830 --> 02:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
as well as state aid of course
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
which may come from
 
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
from other state funds and uh
 
02:18:15.669 --> 02:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
if the swept source goes down
 
02:18:15.679 --> 02:18:16.790 align:start position:0%
if the swept source goes down
then

02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:17.830 align:start position:0%
then
the

02:18:17.830 --> 02:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
school tax rate is likely to go up
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
uh and in my town of jeffrey
 
02:18:27.030 --> 02:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
the swept rate is going down
 
02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:27.830 align:start position:0%
the swept rate is going down
this

02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
the local school rate is more than going
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
up is more than countering that so for
 
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
for many towns that are poor
 
02:18:38.709 --> 02:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
property poor
 
02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
like jeffrey that's what's happening
 
02:18:43.910 --> 02:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
it is the taxpayer we should pay
 
02:18:47.910 --> 02:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
attention to the taxpayer but it's
 
02:18:49.429 --> 02:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
playing out
 
02:18:52.469 --> 02:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
in a different way and it gets
 
02:18:54.709 --> 02:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
it's largely because of the differential
 
02:19:00.629 --> 02:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:00.639 --> 02:19:03.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:06.629 --> 02:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
represent aaron then repton abbas
 
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i'll just be
 
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
brief um with regard to some of the
 
02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
comments from representative ames
 
02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:14.309 align:start position:0%
comments from representative ames
um

02:19:14.309 --> 02:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:17.669 --> 02:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
as we as we sort of divvy up the
 
02:19:20.150 --> 02:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
pot of money here fifty percent thirty
 
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
percent and in in in
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
trying to consider maybe to give a
 
02:19:27.270 --> 02:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
little bit more flexibility with how
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
those funds are divide up maybe we can
 
02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:31.750 align:start position:0%
those funds are divide up maybe we can
insert

02:19:31.750 --> 02:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
insert
 
02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:33.030 align:start position:0%
insert
say

02:19:33.030 --> 02:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
up to 50
 
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
of remaining funds or up to 30 percent
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
of remaining funds could be disbursed so
 
02:19:41.030 --> 02:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
that gives a little bit of flexibility
 
02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
of where
 
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
monies might be targeted in any given
 
02:19:45.359 --> 02:19:46.309 align:start position:0%
monies might be targeted in any given
um

02:19:46.309 --> 02:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:49.030 --> 02:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
year where money being dispersed
 
02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:50.469 align:start position:0%
year where money being dispersed
um

02:19:50.469 --> 02:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:52.309 --> 02:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
because yeah maybe we don't want to have
 
02:19:55.030 --> 02:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
a concrete
 
02:19:57.830 --> 02:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
50 goes here well maybe that year you
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
only want to put
 
02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:01.190 align:start position:0%
only want to put
40

02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
40
 
02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
so if we add the term up to for each i
 
02:20:07.030 --> 02:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
don't i'm just putting that out there to
 
02:20:10.710 --> 02:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
be you know as as a consideration
 
02:20:10.720 --> 02:20:13.270 align:start position:0%
be you know as as a consideration
representative

02:20:13.270 --> 02:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:20:15.349 --> 02:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:20:17.190 --> 02:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
in respect to the issue of property
 
02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:18.389 align:start position:0%
in respect to the issue of property
taxes

02:20:18.389 --> 02:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
02:20:20.309 --> 02:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
and i'll ask this representative ames if
 
02:20:22.950 --> 02:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
you can explain
 
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
how would we ever reduce property taxes
 
02:20:27.270 --> 02:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
anytime you reduce the property tax rate
 
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's done on a percentage based on the
 
02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
value of the assessed house
 
02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:31.990 align:start position:0%
value of the assessed house
so

02:20:31.990 --> 02:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:33.910 --> 02:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
anytime you would reduce it i guess the
 
02:20:35.670 --> 02:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
rationale you're providing i'm hearing
 
02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:36.630 align:start position:0%
rationale you're providing i'm hearing
is

02:20:36.630 --> 02:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
there's really no way to reduce property
 
02:20:40.150 --> 02:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
taxes because it would be dispro people
 
02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
would disproportionately benefit from
 
02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:42.469 align:start position:0%
would disproportionately benefit from
that

02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:20:42.479 --> 02:20:43.349 align:start position:0%
that
but

02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
so i guess
 
02:20:46.950 --> 02:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out how we reduce
 
02:20:48.309 --> 02:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
taxes for the people who need it because
 
02:20:49.590 --> 02:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
people keep saying rich communities
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
wealthy communities
 
02:20:52.790 --> 02:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
salem where i i
 
02:20:54.309 --> 02:20:54.319 align:start position:0%
rep that's the district i represent
 
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
rockingham district 8.
 
02:20:57.429 --> 02:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
there's some million dollar homes in
 
02:20:58.870 --> 02:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
salem then there's homes that are for
 
02:21:00.950 --> 02:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
sale for three hundred thousand dollars
 
02:21:02.710 --> 02:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
there's a very large range we can't pick
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
and choose which houses
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
or which property values we want to give
 
02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
a break to which ones we can't that
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
in of itself would have a discriminatory
 
02:21:10.479 --> 02:21:11.750 align:start position:0%
in of itself would have a discriminatory
impact

02:21:11.750 --> 02:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
impact
 
02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:12.630 align:start position:0%
impact
so

02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
how do we get around that how do we
 
02:21:15.429 --> 02:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
solve the property tax issue in the
 
02:21:15.439 --> 02:21:16.469 align:start position:0%
solve the property tax issue in the
state

02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:21:16.479 --> 02:21:17.349 align:start position:0%
state
if

02:21:17.349 --> 02:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
you feel it's not you want me to respond
 
02:21:22.309 --> 02:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:25.190 --> 02:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
just very briefly just take a moment
 
02:21:27.429 --> 02:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
i think that the uh
 
02:21:30.550 --> 02:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
property taxes is uh what is levied to
 
02:21:33.910 --> 02:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
pay for certain services and in the case
 
02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
of swept it's levied
 
02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh to help pay for
 
02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.070 align:start position:0%
uh to help pay for
education

02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
and it it therefore is a function of
 
02:21:47.110 --> 02:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
the determination by those who are
 
02:21:50.630 --> 02:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:50.640 --> 02:21:52.389 align:start position:0%
 
to

02:21:52.389 --> 02:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:21:54.790 --> 02:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
levy taxes to i
 
02:21:58.710 --> 02:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
establish the uh budget that the taxes
 
02:22:00.150 --> 02:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
will be based on
 
02:22:00.160 --> 02:22:01.349 align:start position:0%
will be based on
um

02:22:01.349 --> 02:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:03.429 --> 02:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
uh the property tax is a function of
 
02:22:03.439 --> 02:22:04.230 align:start position:0%
uh the property tax is a function of
that

02:22:04.230 --> 02:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's a function of and so and it's also
 
02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
a function of what general state aid
 
02:22:11.349 --> 02:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
comes to the
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh in this case we're talking about
 
02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
schools it comes to the school district
 
02:22:18.150 --> 02:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
and so if there's more state aid from
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
other sources then the property tax can
 
02:22:23.190 --> 02:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
go down assuming
 
02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
the budget has been set by the
 
02:22:27.990 --> 02:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
school committee
 
02:22:30.309 --> 02:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
so yeah the property tax can go up or
 
02:22:32.469 --> 02:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
down and i said if we want to provide
 
02:22:34.710 --> 02:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
more school aid
 
02:22:36.230 --> 02:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
to to
 
02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
to fiscally strapped towns we can do
 
02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
that that's been done a lot in the past
 
02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
and that has produced uh
 
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
property tax decreases in some cases not
 
02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
all because sometimes the
 
02:22:51.270 --> 02:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
school needs as assessed by the local
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
school committee
 
02:22:54.710 --> 02:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
still are going up so you know it's a
 
02:22:57.030 --> 02:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
function of determining how much we want
 
02:22:58.870 --> 02:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
to spend on a particular service more
 
02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
than anything else and then the values
 
02:23:02.710 --> 02:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
of individual
 
02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
homes play into how much is going to be
 
02:23:08.469 --> 02:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
paid by each particular taxpayer
 
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether that answers your
 
02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
question it's a little bit rambling i'm
 
02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:12.230 align:start position:0%
question it's a little bit rambling i'm
sorry

02:23:12.230 --> 02:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:23:13.590 --> 02:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
02:23:16.790 --> 02:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
reubson spillsboard
 
02:23:19.750 --> 02:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:23:21.830 --> 02:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative ames uh
 
02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
has prompted me
 
02:23:25.750 --> 02:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
in space of just a few minutes to think
 
02:23:27.429 --> 02:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
hard on this
 
02:23:27.439 --> 02:23:28.469 align:start position:0%
hard on this
and

02:23:28.469 --> 02:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:30.870 --> 02:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
it puts a spin on something i felt on a
 
02:23:32.790 --> 02:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
gut level when i read the amendment and
 
02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
that we had made such a radical swing in
 
02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
the formula
 
02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
of hp 15
 
02:23:42.550 --> 02:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
98 the way it was
 
02:23:44.309 --> 02:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
passed by the house
 
02:23:46.469 --> 02:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
to the way the amendment is
 
02:23:48.550 --> 02:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
it was i was trying to sort of how did
 
02:23:51.910 --> 02:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
we go from 25 million up front to
 
02:23:55.349 --> 02:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
drug uh issues and 90 of the risk to
 
02:23:55.359 --> 02:23:56.710 align:start position:0%
drug uh issues and 90 of the risk to
education

02:23:56.710 --> 02:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
flipping over to this
 
02:24:01.429 --> 02:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
that radical shift
 
02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
was unsettling because it sort of
 
02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:05.030 align:start position:0%
was unsettling because it sort of
highlights

02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
highlights
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
that fundamentally it's an arbitrary
 
02:24:09.590 --> 02:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
allocation i mean we all have to agree
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
to it
 
02:24:13.030 --> 02:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
and send it back to the house florida to
 
02:24:15.510 --> 02:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
to get the house's concurrence but
 
02:24:18.469 --> 02:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
representative ames has
 
02:24:19.750 --> 02:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
focused us
 
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
on a parallel question we've been saying
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
as we discussed this
 
02:24:25.750 --> 02:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
we're not the policy committee we're the
 
02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
revenue committee well by the same token
 
02:24:29.110 --> 02:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
the spending committee
 
02:24:33.429 --> 02:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
and he's suggesting that the spending
 
02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
decisions be
 
02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:36.230 align:start position:0%
decisions be
left

02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
left
 
02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:37.190 align:start position:0%
left
for

02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:24:39.270 --> 02:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
future biennial consideration in the
 
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
course of the budget
 
02:24:43.510 --> 02:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
and i hadn't thought of that
 
02:24:46.389 --> 02:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
i think it's an extremely powerful point
 
02:24:49.030 --> 02:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
frankly if i was an appropriator
 
02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
i would rather
 
02:24:53.110 --> 02:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
see uh comparable funds
 
02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh going back to restoring at least in
 
02:24:58.070 --> 02:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
part fiscal capacity disparity aid
 
02:25:01.590 --> 02:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
and i was a co-sponsor of hb 608 last
 
02:25:02.950 --> 02:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
year that didn't get out of the
 
02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
education committee and would have done
 
02:25:06.309 --> 02:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
that so
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
these you know that might just be my
 
02:25:09.590 --> 02:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
personal preference but that's a
 
02:25:11.830 --> 02:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
discussion that probably
 
02:25:16.469 --> 02:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
and just
 
02:25:21.429 --> 02:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
so we do have two members of finance
 
02:25:22.870 --> 02:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
committee and representative hatch
 
02:25:24.630 --> 02:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to like
 
02:25:27.270 --> 02:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
everybody yeah yes thank you mr chair
 
02:25:29.429 --> 02:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
and i guess i guess i was trying not to
 
02:25:31.830 --> 02:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
be quite as blunt but i'd like to thank
 
02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:32.790 align:start position:0%
be quite as blunt but i'd like to thank
um

02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:34.469 --> 02:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
representative ames for his thoughts
 
02:25:36.790 --> 02:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
because they coincide with mine
 
02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:38.309 align:start position:0%
because they coincide with mine
um

02:25:38.309 --> 02:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:39.830 --> 02:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
in finance
 
02:25:43.110 --> 02:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
we appropriate and we do that after a
 
02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:44.790 align:start position:0%
we appropriate and we do that after a
thoughtful

02:25:44.790 --> 02:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
thoughtful
 
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
discussion and research of what's being
 
02:25:49.429 --> 02:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
asked and what's being asked is often
 
02:25:51.510 --> 02:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
for specific items
 
02:25:53.670 --> 02:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
now i did mention that something like
 
02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
this is not unprecedented
 
02:25:59.190 --> 02:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
the alcohol fund initially was funded
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
like that but just to give an example of
 
02:26:03.590 --> 02:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
my thoughts
 
02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:04.630 align:start position:0%
my thoughts
our

02:26:04.630 --> 02:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
legislative aide our
 
02:26:08.950 --> 02:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
mr hoffman
 
02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
he's one of the ones that assist us in
 
02:26:13.270 --> 02:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
division one and gains information for
 
02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:13.990 align:start position:0%
division one and gains information for
us

02:26:13.990 --> 02:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:26:15.910 --> 02:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
and here's the question i asked them
 
02:26:17.590 --> 02:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
last week
 
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
or even before that when i saw this bill
 
02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
do you know of any other circumstance
 
02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
where funding
 
02:26:26.070 --> 02:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
of this magnitude was arbitrary
 
02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
without end user having input and and
 
02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's important because
 
02:26:35.270 --> 02:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
how we determine what funds are needed
 
02:26:36.389 --> 02:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
for where
 
02:26:39.510 --> 02:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
in this state um it's all of our monies
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
is the end users meaning the department
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
that are
 
02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
tasked with the responsibility of
 
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
whatever we dictate they need to do
 
02:26:49.349 --> 02:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
comes to us
 
02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
they have a budget
 
02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
they speak to that budget the reason for
 
02:26:55.590 --> 02:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
that budget and then we go from there
 
02:26:57.030 --> 02:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
and then we decide what should or
 
02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be done
 
02:26:58.319 --> 02:26:59.670 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be done
now

02:26:59.670 --> 02:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:27:03.830 --> 02:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
i think it also should be noted that um
 
02:27:07.830 --> 02:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
i i stated that we had the elk
 
02:27:09.270 --> 02:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
that was not funded for many for a
 
02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
couple decades not one penny of
 
02:27:17.270 --> 02:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
state liquor store revenues went into
 
02:27:19.910 --> 02:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
the alcohol fund um there was other
 
02:27:22.710 --> 02:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
methodologies where that was funded
 
02:27:25.030 --> 02:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
so what happens in reality we can have
 
02:27:26.950 --> 02:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
all this stuff
 
02:27:28.950 --> 02:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
planned and put in
 
02:27:31.910 --> 02:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
for future budgets to consider
 
02:27:34.389 --> 02:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
but what can happen and what does happen
 
02:27:37.230 --> 02:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
is i heard somebody mention that earlier
 
02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:39.030 align:start position:0%
is i heard somebody mention that earlier
notwithstanding

02:27:39.030 --> 02:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
and so in reality what happens in
 
02:27:43.429 --> 02:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
finance and it's just true
 
02:27:45.910 --> 02:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
that for example when the alcohol fund
 
02:27:48.150 --> 02:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
came up there was not the money there to
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
fund it completely so we simply state
 
02:27:53.190 --> 02:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding whatever rs rsa dictates
 
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
that that must be done
 
02:27:58.070 --> 02:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
is suspended or whatever terminology is
 
02:27:59.910 --> 02:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate or cut
 
02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:01.910 align:start position:0%
appropriate or cut
so

02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think
 
02:28:06.309 --> 02:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
there's i don't like any part of this
 
02:28:08.950 --> 02:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
because it's contrary to how
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
this state funds its different
 
02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:13.110 align:start position:0%
this state funds its different
responsibilities

02:28:13.110 --> 02:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
02:28:15.190 --> 02:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
but again
 
02:28:16.630 --> 02:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
some things in there
 
02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned for example
 
02:28:22.710 --> 02:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
using it to for hhs to address
 
02:28:24.389 --> 02:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
addiction problems is certainly
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate because there's a concise
 
02:28:28.150 --> 02:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
nexus between
 
02:28:29.830 --> 02:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
what's the activity
 
02:28:32.309 --> 02:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
and the results and what it may produce
 
02:28:33.750 --> 02:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
a need so
 
02:28:36.710 --> 02:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
i really can't support this as it is and
 
02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:38.070 align:start position:0%
i really can't support this as it is and
that's

02:28:38.070 --> 02:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:28:39.830 --> 02:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
most of the reasons why thank you mr
 
02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:40.870 align:start position:0%
most of the reasons why thank you mr
chairman

02:28:40.870 --> 02:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:28:42.550 --> 02:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative romney representative
 
02:28:44.399 --> 02:28:45.590 align:start position:0%
representative romney representative
hatch

02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
hatch
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that uh so
 
02:28:49.429 --> 02:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
what you're saying it really doesn't
 
02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
matter what we put in here
 
02:28:53.750 --> 02:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
because come next budget cycle
 
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
hb2 comes into play
 
02:28:55.920 --> 02:28:56.790 align:start position:0%
hb2 comes into play
and

02:28:56.790 --> 02:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
and some of this
 
02:29:00.070 --> 02:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
may survive and some of this may not
 
02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:01.110 align:start position:0%
may survive and some of this may not
survive

02:29:01.110 --> 02:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
survive
 
02:29:03.510 --> 02:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
i was just giving you a it matters i
 
02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
believe right everything matters but i
 
02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
was just giving you a historical summary
 
02:29:11.270 --> 02:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
of what does happen what can happen
 
02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
and undoubtedly at some point will
 
02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:14.710 align:start position:0%
and undoubtedly at some point will
happen

02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's not without merit to have it there
 
02:29:18.389 --> 02:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean it won't happen i guess
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
it was the will of the original bill
 
02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's good to start with that yeah
 
02:29:28.309 --> 02:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:28.319 --> 02:29:29.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:29:29.349 --> 02:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:29:29.359 --> 02:29:31.990 align:start position:0%
okay
representatives

02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
i can explain the rationale behind the
 
02:29:35.990 --> 02:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
property tax relief
 
02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
other than the obvious that's one of the
 
02:29:39.349 --> 02:29:39.359 align:start position:0%

02:29:39.359 --> 02:29:40.630 align:start position:0%
complaints i hear the most from
constituents

02:29:40.630 --> 02:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
02:29:42.150 --> 02:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
the thought process was if the state's
 
02:29:44.870 --> 02:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
going to engage in a retail enterprise
 
02:29:47.030 --> 02:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
and make a which i hope a significant
 
02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
amount of revenue that was one way of
 
02:29:51.190 --> 02:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
giving the revenue back to the people
 
02:29:52.950 --> 02:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
and that was the exact rational i had
 
02:29:52.960 --> 02:29:53.910 align:start position:0%
and that was the exact rational i had
and

02:29:53.910 --> 02:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
if future legislators want to change
 
02:29:57.190 --> 02:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
that they can do that whether it's
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
through hb2 or
 
02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
separate legislation i know i wouldn't
 
02:30:02.469 --> 02:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
support to remove the property tax
 
02:30:05.190 --> 02:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
reduction and i would
 
02:30:07.429 --> 02:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
argue heavily against that
 
02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:12.469 --> 02:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
any further
 
02:30:12.479 --> 02:30:13.830 align:start position:0%
any further
representative

02:30:13.830 --> 02:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:30:15.990 --> 02:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:16.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
again

02:30:16.790 --> 02:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:30:18.550 --> 02:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
i go back i'm still struggling with the
 
02:30:21.030 --> 02:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
concept that if we reduce the swept tax
 
02:30:22.710 --> 02:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
other taxes go up because if you
 
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
understand the way the swept tax is done
 
02:30:25.990 --> 02:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
and what it's used for when this town
 
02:30:28.070 --> 02:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
collects as a swept tax which i think in
 
02:30:30.309 --> 02:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
my first term on ways of means my couple
 
02:30:33.510 --> 02:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
a few years ago um i found out i always
 
02:30:35.349 --> 02:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
thought i paid that and the town sent a
 
02:30:37.510 --> 02:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
check to the to the state it's statewide
 
02:30:39.190 --> 02:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
property tax the state gets a check i
 
02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
write i write a check to the town the
 
02:30:42.550 --> 02:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
town takes the state portion sends it to
 
02:30:45.030 --> 02:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
the state that's not what happens
 
02:30:47.110 --> 02:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
actually state never sees that money
 
02:30:49.429 --> 02:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
that money is used as an offset to state
 
02:30:52.150 --> 02:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
out to state aid so when it when the
 
02:30:54.790 --> 02:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
state looks at education they go hey
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
this town deserves x dollars in state
 
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
aid for all of based on the kids and
 
02:31:01.510 --> 02:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
everything else that has in the school
 
02:31:04.790 --> 02:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
district the town the state nets that
 
02:31:06.550 --> 02:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
against the swept tax that the town
 
02:31:08.870 --> 02:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
collected so if you do 110 million you
 
02:31:10.389 --> 02:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
only collected 100 million you get a
 
02:31:11.830 --> 02:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
check for 10 million dollars from the
 
02:31:13.590 --> 02:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
state you keep the 100 million you
 
02:31:16.309 --> 02:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
already collected that's how it's done
 
02:31:19.349 --> 02:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
right so even if there's a reduction in
 
02:31:21.429 --> 02:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
what we collect from the citizens the
 
02:31:23.190 --> 02:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
state still makes that up on the other
 
02:31:24.630 --> 02:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
side in this case we're making it up
 
02:31:26.230 --> 02:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
through the way of
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
this tax on marijuana this this 50 of
 
02:31:31.190 --> 02:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
revenue going to marijuana that's how
 
02:31:33.110 --> 02:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
the swept tax works
 
02:31:35.110 --> 02:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
is that it's the net difference between
 
02:31:36.710 --> 02:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
what the town collects and what the
 
02:31:38.469 --> 02:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
state what the state owes you for
 
02:31:40.469 --> 02:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
education adequacy and you get the
 
02:31:41.750 --> 02:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
difference now
 
02:31:43.349 --> 02:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
the interesting part was if you collect
 
02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
too much
 
02:31:46.469 --> 02:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
you get to keep that the state makes
 
02:31:48.550 --> 02:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
that up for we give the money to the
 
02:31:50.150 --> 02:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
towns that are short
 
02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
so again if you're a property rich town
 
02:31:54.469 --> 02:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
you even if we reduce this you're going
 
02:31:57.349 --> 02:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
to get less money however
 
02:31:59.830 --> 02:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
you're won't do that money anyway
 
02:32:01.830 --> 02:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
because you over collected the swept tax
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
from what your adequacy aid or state aid
 
02:32:03.840 --> 02:32:04.790 align:start position:0%
from what your adequacy aid or state aid
was

02:32:04.790 --> 02:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:32:06.950 --> 02:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
so again i only see this as helping
 
02:32:08.950 --> 02:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
every taxpayer
 
02:32:12.070 --> 02:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
every single taxpayer in the state will
 
02:32:13.990 --> 02:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
see on their specific the line the only
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
line we control in here where we
 
02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
directly tax citizens and
 
02:32:21.270 --> 02:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's the line we can manage
 
02:32:22.950 --> 02:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
everything else is based on local
 
02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
control and local taxes so um
 
02:32:29.349 --> 02:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
i i i support this if as representative
 
02:32:31.670 --> 02:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh i think was nunas just said if we're
 
02:32:33.429 --> 02:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
gonna make a profit we should and we're
 
02:32:34.950 --> 02:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
entering a retail agency we should
 
02:32:36.630 --> 02:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
directly give the citizens the profits
 
02:32:38.710 --> 02:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
back as in in a percentage
 
02:32:41.349 --> 02:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
and i think that that's what this does
 
02:32:43.510 --> 02:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
and i strongly support keeping this
 
02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
language again we're entering into an uh
 
02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:47.990 align:start position:0%
language again we're entering into an uh
a

02:32:47.990 --> 02:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:32:50.790 --> 02:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
new revenue stream um i do notice that
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
and i don't think i mentioned it in
 
02:32:54.230 --> 02:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
section two we give that 30 to the new
 
02:32:55.670 --> 02:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire retirement system once that
 
02:32:57.590 --> 02:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
debts off all of that money goes into
 
02:33:00.389 --> 02:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
ham just a generic education trust fund
 
02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
once that debt's paid off so we are
 
02:33:04.230 --> 02:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately going to give money just to
 
02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
generic education costs
 
02:33:08.230 --> 02:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
that will allow for increases but first
 
02:33:10.710 --> 02:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
let's pay down our debts before we give
 
02:33:13.670 --> 02:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:16.309 --> 02:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
further comments
 
02:33:16.319 --> 02:33:17.349 align:start position:0%
further comments
then

02:33:17.349 --> 02:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:33:19.429 --> 02:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to take a break for
 
02:33:19.439 --> 02:33:20.870 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to take a break for
lunch

02:33:20.870 --> 02:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
02:33:24.389 --> 02:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:42.550 --> 02:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:42.560 --> 02:33:48.389 align:start position:0%
 
is

02:33:48.389 --> 02:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:48.399 --> 03:46:47.110 align:start position:0%
 
time

03:46:47.110 --> 03:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:47.120 --> 03:46:50.389 align:start position:0%
 
1598

03:46:50.389 --> 03:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:53.269 --> 03:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
representative lyon has some new and new
 
03:46:53.279 --> 03:46:54.870 align:start position:0%
representative lyon has some new and new
information

03:46:54.870 --> 03:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:46:56.950 --> 03:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you so i got
 
03:46:58.790 --> 03:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
the first draft of an amendment back but
 
03:47:00.229 --> 03:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
obviously we made more some minor
 
03:47:01.830 --> 03:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
changes today which i'll have to submit
 
03:47:03.269 --> 03:47:03.279 align:start position:0%
for another amendment which i'm hoping i
 
03:47:04.389 --> 03:47:04.399 align:start position:0%
can get because it's all just like
 
03:47:06.710 --> 03:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
adding the word all and adding for
 
03:47:08.550 --> 03:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
potency under the testing and some minor
 
03:47:10.070 --> 03:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
word changes so i'm hoping we can stick
 
03:47:11.510 --> 03:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
around get that amendment back and vote
 
03:47:13.429 --> 03:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
today but that being said i need to tell
 
03:47:15.750 --> 03:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
you what the language says for the other
 
03:47:17.990 --> 03:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
things so when we were talking about
 
03:47:19.910 --> 03:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with the edibles
 
03:47:22.150 --> 03:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
what the ols did was they changed the
 
03:47:23.990 --> 03:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
definition of cannabis products which is
 
03:47:25.830 --> 03:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
what the liquor liquor commission is
 
03:47:27.910 --> 03:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to sell as cannabis products and
 
03:47:30.389 --> 03:47:30.399 align:start position:0%
cannabis products are defined now as
 
03:47:32.710 --> 03:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
means concentrated cannabis products and
 
03:47:34.630 --> 03:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis products that are compromised
 
03:47:36.870 --> 03:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
of cannabis and other ingredients and
 
03:47:38.950 --> 03:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
are intended for personal use such as
 
03:47:40.710 --> 03:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
but not limited to creams ointments and
 
03:47:40.720 --> 03:47:41.910 align:start position:0%
but not limited to creams ointments and
tinctures

03:47:41.910 --> 03:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
tinctures
 
03:47:43.990 --> 03:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of this paragraph
 
03:47:46.550 --> 03:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis products shall not include
 
03:47:49.510 --> 03:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis infused food or drink products
 
03:47:51.429 --> 03:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to cannabis
 
03:47:53.590 --> 03:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
infused edibles such as candies gummies
 
03:47:56.309 --> 03:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
brownies cookies or cannabis infused
 
03:47:58.630 --> 03:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages of
 
03:48:01.030 --> 03:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
any kind so that's the new definition
 
03:48:02.070 --> 03:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
basically it says they can sell
 
03:48:04.229 --> 03:48:04.239 align:start position:0%
everything cannabis but food and drinks
 
03:48:04.239 --> 03:48:04.950 align:start position:0%
everything cannabis but food and drinks
so

03:48:04.950 --> 03:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:48:04.960 --> 03:48:09.830 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:48:09.830 --> 03:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:12.389 --> 03:48:12.399 align:start position:0%
so is everybody kind of okay with that
 
03:48:13.990 --> 03:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
language that that language if i'm going
 
03:48:15.429 --> 03:48:15.439 align:start position:0%
to send it back in for an amendment i
 
03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
want to make sure i'm not because i got
 
03:48:18.630 --> 03:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
a couple of those couple word languages
 
03:48:20.870 --> 03:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
could you read it one more time sure
 
03:48:23.110 --> 03:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis products means concentrated

03:49:03.349 --> 03:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
i think that's a good definition however
 
03:49:08.830 --> 03:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:12.389 --> 03:49:12.399 align:start position:0%
line 11

has the duty to buy and have in its
 
03:49:17.670 --> 03:49:17.680 align:start position:0%

03:49:20.710 --> 03:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
in the manner provided in this title
 
03:49:20.720 --> 03:49:22.309 align:start position:0%
in the manner provided in this title
so

03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:49:24.870 --> 03:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
how cannabis products plays into this
 
03:49:24.880 --> 03:49:26.229 align:start position:0%
how cannabis products plays into this
equation

03:49:26.229 --> 03:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
equation
 
03:49:29.590 --> 03:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh remains to be answered and
 
03:49:31.189 --> 03:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
03:49:33.030 --> 03:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
maybe you've got the connection figured
 
03:49:34.550 --> 03:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
out but i don't
 
03:49:41.750 --> 03:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:43.189 --> 03:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
don't say so you're looking at section
 
03:49:43.199 --> 03:49:44.550 align:start position:0%
don't say so you're looking at section
3a

03:49:44.550 --> 03:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
3a
 
03:49:44.560 --> 03:49:45.590 align:start position:0%
3a
yes

03:49:45.590 --> 03:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:49:47.189 --> 03:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
that's good shall be the duty of the
 
03:49:48.950 --> 03:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
commission of buying heavens possession
 
03:49:51.429 --> 03:49:51.439 align:start position:0%
cannabis for sale i can just again
 
03:49:52.870 --> 03:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
basically the authorization i can just
 
03:49:54.389 --> 03:49:54.399 align:start position:0%
add i could add the word products after
 
03:49:55.750 --> 03:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
that just say cannabis products because
 
03:49:58.469 --> 03:49:58.479 align:start position:0%
that's we just defined it yeah
 
03:49:59.830 --> 03:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
again that's why i'm asking because if
 
03:50:01.830 --> 03:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
there's a change there we need to with
 
03:50:04.630 --> 03:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
the exception you'd have to say
 
03:50:07.830 --> 03:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
duty to have cannabis products for sale
 
03:50:11.110 --> 03:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
except as allowed for therapeutic
 
03:50:11.120 --> 03:50:12.469 align:start position:0%
except as allowed for therapeutic
um

03:50:12.469 --> 03:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:14.710 --> 03:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
you know the the exception that you have
 
03:50:17.110 --> 03:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in there for the uh
 
03:50:19.269 --> 03:50:19.279 align:start position:0%
those that have a card
 
03:50:19.279 --> 03:50:21.590 align:start position:0%
those that have a card
okay

03:50:21.590 --> 03:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:50:23.990 --> 03:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
so that was page nine
 
03:50:24.000 --> 03:50:28.950 align:start position:0%
so that was page nine
line

03:50:28.950 --> 03:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:31.830 --> 03:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
so i was page 11 representative
 
03:50:46.309 --> 03:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:51.269 --> 03:50:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:53.990 --> 03:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:54.000 --> 03:50:55.349 align:start position:0%
 
dick

03:50:55.349 --> 03:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
dick
 
03:51:01.030 --> 03:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:02.469 --> 03:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
i don't know products
 
03:51:41.670 --> 03:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:43.910 --> 03:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative romney has a question for
 
03:51:46.790 --> 03:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
you okay i'm listening
 
03:51:48.710 --> 03:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
so so we we're
 
03:51:52.389 --> 03:51:52.399 align:start position:0%
we're still going to allow medical uh
 
03:51:54.950 --> 03:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
therapeutic people with their cards and
 
03:51:56.630 --> 03:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
to buy
 
03:51:59.670 --> 03:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
or do we take that out
 
03:52:02.550 --> 03:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
the way i would understand it is that
 
03:52:04.870 --> 03:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
the authorization of the commission
 
03:52:07.590 --> 03:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
liquor commission would be
 
03:52:08.710 --> 03:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
to sell
 
03:52:08.720 --> 03:52:10.229 align:start position:0%
to sell
product

03:52:10.229 --> 03:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
product
 
03:52:15.510 --> 03:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:17.110 --> 03:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
and also to
 
03:52:19.189 --> 03:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
have a have an exception built right in
 
03:52:21.349 --> 03:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
there that allows them to sell
 
03:52:22.870 --> 03:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
to the uh
 
03:52:25.030 --> 03:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
the customers of the therap alternative
 
03:52:27.910 --> 03:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
treatment centers who have cards
 
03:52:30.150 --> 03:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
right so that so you've got to build in
 
03:52:31.670 --> 03:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
the exception somewhere if you're going
 
03:52:34.309 --> 03:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
to have uh the limitation well at one
 
03:52:35.830 --> 03:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
point we thought about maybe taking that
 
03:52:35.840 --> 03:52:37.189 align:start position:0%
point we thought about maybe taking that
out

03:52:37.189 --> 03:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:52:38.790 --> 03:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
but i guess we didn't
 
03:52:41.269 --> 03:52:41.279 align:start position:0%
sounds like but in that case they can
 
03:52:43.030 --> 03:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
they can have the edibles they could
 
03:52:45.030 --> 03:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
have the jelly beans and all that
 
03:52:51.670 --> 03:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:54.950 --> 03:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
let them finish typing yep so i what i
 
03:52:56.630 --> 03:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
put was um
 
03:52:58.229 --> 03:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
in that authorization section we have to
 
03:52:59.750 --> 03:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
make sure we're allowing them to sell
 
03:52:59.760 --> 03:53:00.550 align:start position:0%
make sure we're allowing them to sell
cat

03:53:00.550 --> 03:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
cat
 
03:53:02.870 --> 03:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
to sell cannabis in other words cannabis
 
03:53:04.790 --> 03:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
products allowed by the statute as well
 
03:53:06.710 --> 03:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
as the therapeutic cannibal process
 
03:53:09.429 --> 03:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
products allowed by 126x
 
03:53:11.750 --> 03:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
for persons with cards
 
03:53:14.550 --> 03:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:17.189 --> 03:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
03:53:19.670 --> 03:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
yeah well then just it just puts the
 
03:53:22.870 --> 03:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
atc's in direct competition with the uh
 
03:53:25.110 --> 03:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
within these state stores that's all
 
03:53:27.030 --> 03:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
when it comes to those products so the
 
03:53:28.389 --> 03:53:28.399 align:start position:0%
interesting part about those products
 
03:53:30.469 --> 03:53:30.479 align:start position:0%
especially if i may mr chair yes is
 
03:53:31.750 --> 03:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
especially on the
 
03:53:33.670 --> 03:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
edible side the gummies that will be
 
03:53:35.510 --> 03:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
allowed in the state liquor store are
 
03:53:37.269 --> 03:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
severely under
 
03:53:39.670 --> 03:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh their grade i won't say grade but
 
03:53:42.550 --> 03:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
their potency is significantly less than
 
03:53:45.349 --> 03:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
what you can get in a distribu
 
03:53:45.359 --> 03:53:46.469 align:start position:0%
what you can get in a distribu
atc

03:53:46.469 --> 03:53:46.479 align:start position:0%
atc
 
03:53:48.070 --> 03:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
so it's it's to give basically
 
03:53:49.510 --> 03:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
short-term relief but not if you want
 
03:53:52.150 --> 03:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
your regular high your regular
 
03:53:53.990 --> 03:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
grade you know whatever it does for you
 
03:53:55.189 --> 03:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to need to go to a medical
 
03:53:56.870 --> 03:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
store to get it otherwise the stuff you
 
03:53:58.550 --> 03:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
buy from the state state store is going
 
03:54:00.630 --> 03:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
to be pretty watered down
 
03:54:02.870 --> 03:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
but i think i think mr chair
 
03:54:04.469 --> 03:54:04.479 align:start position:0%
i think the way it works is the problem
 
03:54:06.790 --> 03:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
is regulating what's how much
 
03:54:08.870 --> 03:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
concentration there is in each
 
03:54:11.429 --> 03:54:11.439 align:start position:0%
brownie or cookie or whatever
 
03:54:13.830 --> 03:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
is you eat two cookies instead of one
 
03:54:15.590 --> 03:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's that we struggle with that and
 
03:54:17.030 --> 03:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
the commission how do you how do you
 
03:54:19.990 --> 03:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
regulate how much thc
 
03:54:21.590 --> 03:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
and that that's what happens people will
 
03:54:24.790 --> 03:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
just eat more
 
03:54:27.269 --> 03:54:27.279 align:start position:0%
to get to a higher level
 
03:54:29.269 --> 03:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
but i i that's not a it's a policy thing
 
03:54:31.510 --> 03:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
i think i'm just throwing that out and
 
03:54:35.269 --> 03:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
that's the same thing as smoking two
 
03:54:37.750 --> 03:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
joints so mr so mr chair moving on the
 
03:54:40.950 --> 03:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
other change was around the therapeutic
 
03:54:43.429 --> 03:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
centers being able to license
 
03:54:45.269 --> 03:54:45.279 align:start position:0%
and they changed that to me give me one
 
03:54:45.279 --> 03:54:46.550 align:start position:0%
and they changed that to me give me one
second

03:54:46.550 --> 03:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:54:49.349 --> 03:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
let me find it again
 
03:54:55.910 --> 03:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:57.349 --> 03:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
03:55:00.790 --> 03:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
all right the new language reads um an
 
03:55:03.349 --> 03:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment center
 
03:55:03.359 --> 03:55:05.110 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment center
regis

03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
regis
 
03:55:06.950 --> 03:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
well it's not on it's this is the bill
 
03:55:08.469 --> 03:55:08.479 align:start position:0%
this is the amend the first amendment i
 
03:55:09.910 --> 03:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
got from this morning when i sent it to
 
03:55:11.830 --> 03:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
him so i'm going to send it back but
 
03:55:12.950 --> 03:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
where is it
 
03:55:15.349 --> 03:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
it's roughly we're on i think it's page
 
03:55:17.830 --> 03:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
seven i think yeah yeah so but this
 
03:55:19.189 --> 03:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
language is going to be different it's
 
03:55:20.710 --> 03:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
going to read
 
03:55:22.870 --> 03:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
an alternative this is that section six
 
03:55:24.309 --> 03:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
we thought about deleting if we didn't
 
03:55:25.670 --> 03:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
want to give the alternative centers the
 
03:55:28.469 --> 03:55:28.479 align:start position:0%
chance to manufacture and cultivate
 
03:55:30.229 --> 03:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
the new language reads an alternative
 
03:55:31.990 --> 03:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
treatment center registered to operate
 
03:55:35.269 --> 03:55:35.279 align:start position:0%
pursuant to rsa 126x may file an
 
03:55:36.630 --> 03:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
application to obtain a separate
 
03:55:38.070 --> 03:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
registration to operate a cannabis
 
03:55:40.469 --> 03:55:40.479 align:start position:0%
cultivation facility in cannabis product
 
03:55:42.150 --> 03:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility a cannabis
 
03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
transporter pursuant to this chapter
 
03:55:46.469 --> 03:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
such applicants shall comply with the
 
03:55:48.309 --> 03:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
same application process set forth in
 
03:55:49.910 --> 03:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
this section and shall be subject to the
 
03:55:51.510 --> 03:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
provisions of this section of this
 
03:55:54.150 --> 03:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
chapter if approved the applicant may
 
03:55:56.710 --> 03:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
operate as an alternative treatment
 
03:56:00.389 --> 03:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
center pursuant to rsa 126x and as a
 
03:56:02.469 --> 03:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
cannabis cultivation facility cannabis
 
03:56:04.309 --> 03:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
product manufacturing facility a
 
03:56:06.150 --> 03:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis transporter pursuant to this
 
03:56:08.790 --> 03:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
chapter as a separate entity in a
 
03:56:10.790 --> 03:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
separate physical location
 
03:56:12.870 --> 03:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
so again this this would allow them to
 
03:56:14.229 --> 03:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
although i'm not even sure we need the
 
03:56:15.910 --> 03:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
separate entity anymore but basically
 
03:56:17.110 --> 03:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
this would allow them under their
 
03:56:18.469 --> 03:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit license to be able to
 
03:56:20.070 --> 03:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
sell to the state if they obtained a
 
03:56:22.830 --> 03:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:25.750 --> 03:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
so is that the same language yeah
 
03:56:30.150 --> 03:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:31.830 --> 03:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
i still think just as a personal though
 
03:56:33.590 --> 03:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
if you read that
 
03:56:35.189 --> 03:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
section if we took out the separate
 
03:56:36.790 --> 03:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
entities piece
 
03:56:37.910 --> 03:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
they could run under their
 
03:56:39.670 --> 03:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit license and what would
 
03:56:41.510 --> 03:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
require them to do is any money they
 
03:56:43.830 --> 03:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
made from selling to the state pursuant
 
03:56:45.510 --> 03:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
to the 126 chapter they would have to
 
03:56:46.790 --> 03:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
roll back in for the benefit of their
 
03:56:46.800 --> 03:56:48.469 align:start position:0%
roll back in for the benefit of their
patients

03:56:48.469 --> 03:56:48.479 align:start position:0%
patients
 
03:56:50.070 --> 03:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
if we just want to remove the separate
 
03:56:51.510 --> 03:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
entity language
 
03:56:52.950 --> 03:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
it would allow them to use their current
 
03:56:55.189 --> 03:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
process of their current facilities
 
03:56:57.030 --> 03:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
and operate under their current
 
03:56:58.790 --> 03:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit license but sell it to
 
03:57:00.469 --> 03:57:00.479 align:start position:0%
the state and any monies that were made
 
03:57:01.830 --> 03:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
in that transaction would have to be
 
03:57:04.710 --> 03:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
rolled back into under the 126 section
 
03:57:07.189 --> 03:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
to their uh patients for the benefit of
 
03:57:08.469 --> 03:57:08.479 align:start position:0%
their patients is actually what it says
 
03:57:11.030 --> 03:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
in one twenty six
 
03:57:11.040 --> 03:57:15.990 align:start position:0%
in one twenty six
so

03:57:15.990 --> 03:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:16.000 --> 03:57:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

03:57:19.030 --> 03:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
do you intend to have ols draw that up
 
03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
that way well i'm asking the committee
 
03:57:25.030 --> 03:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
if where if we're inclined to do that i
 
03:57:26.469 --> 03:57:26.479 align:start position:0%
could strike the separate entities in
 
03:57:28.070 --> 03:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
separate physical locations and just say
 
03:57:28.080 --> 03:57:28.790 align:start position:0%
separate physical locations and just say
they

03:57:28.790 --> 03:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:57:29.910 --> 03:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
they can operate under their
 
03:57:31.670 --> 03:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit license and they can
 
03:57:33.189 --> 03:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
obtain a license to cultivate
 
03:57:35.030 --> 03:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturer for the state
 
03:57:37.030 --> 03:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
and that would and it but the any
 
03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
revenues they have pursuant to the
 
03:57:41.830 --> 03:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
current 126x language says that
 
03:57:43.429 --> 03:57:43.439 align:start position:0%
it would have to go for the benefit of
 
03:57:45.349 --> 03:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
the patients their patients
 
03:57:52.790 --> 03:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:56.389 --> 03:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
ones that want to leave it the way it is
 
03:57:59.670 --> 03:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:01.189 --> 03:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
you want to leave it the way it is with
 
03:58:01.199 --> 03:58:02.070 align:start position:0%
you want to leave it the way it is with
a

03:58:02.070 --> 03:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:58:03.429 --> 03:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
separate entity separate physical
 
03:58:03.439 --> 03:58:05.590 align:start position:0%
separate entity separate physical
location

03:58:05.590 --> 03:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
location
 
03:58:06.790 --> 03:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
that's easy
 
03:58:08.389 --> 03:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
that solves it
 
03:58:10.150 --> 03:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
so is everybody does that mean everybody
 
03:58:11.750 --> 03:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
else is in favor of striking that let
 
03:58:12.710 --> 03:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
them run under their current
 
03:58:15.269 --> 03:58:15.279 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit license and to use their
 
03:58:16.710 --> 03:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
any monies they make to the benefit of
 
03:58:18.550 --> 03:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
their patients
 
03:58:21.510 --> 03:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
if you are raise your hand
 
03:58:23.030 --> 03:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what that means you can't
 
03:58:27.670 --> 03:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:30.389 --> 03:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
okay that's the majority
 
03:58:32.229 --> 03:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
mr chair i have a question though as a
 
03:58:33.590 --> 03:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that
 
03:58:35.429 --> 03:58:35.439 align:start position:0%
so i i thought we heard testimony at the
 
03:58:38.469 --> 03:58:38.479 align:start position:0%
beginning of hearing this bill that the
 
03:58:40.389 --> 03:58:40.399 align:start position:0%
atcs were concerned if they couldn't
 
03:58:42.150 --> 03:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
compete with this market that they would
 
03:58:44.389 --> 03:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
lose some of their you know customers or
 
03:58:47.830 --> 03:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
patients to to the state-run stores so
 
03:58:49.670 --> 03:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
they were looking for a way to have that
 
03:58:51.910 --> 03:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
competition and one of the ideas was to
 
03:58:54.790 --> 03:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
allow them to to participate in this
 
03:58:56.469 --> 03:58:56.479 align:start position:0%
state-run market so
 
03:58:57.750 --> 03:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
if we're saying the only way you can
 
03:58:59.670 --> 03:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
participate is to be a non-profit and to
 
03:59:00.790 --> 03:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
roll your
 
03:59:02.630 --> 03:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
you know revenues back into your into
 
03:59:05.269 --> 03:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
your business model as a non-profit it's
 
03:59:06.790 --> 03:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
not going to be putting them on the same
 
03:59:09.189 --> 03:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
competitive standing point as as a
 
03:59:11.590 --> 03:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
for-profit business
 
03:59:13.110 --> 03:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
so i think we're running into the
 
03:59:16.229 --> 03:59:16.239 align:start position:0%
original concern it would be unequal and
 
03:59:19.030 --> 03:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
unfair for two you know different types
 
03:59:21.429 --> 03:59:21.439 align:start position:0%
of entities to be participating in the
 
03:59:22.790 --> 03:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
market one would have the ability to
 
03:59:28.790 --> 03:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:30.150 --> 03:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
am i wrong is that what other people
 
03:59:33.510 --> 03:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
heard during testimony or
 
03:59:33.520 --> 03:59:34.150 align:start position:0%
heard during testimony or
so

03:59:34.150 --> 03:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:59:36.150 --> 03:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
if i may misuse to answer her questions
 
03:59:37.750 --> 03:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
so again it depends on what you think
 
03:59:39.990 --> 03:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of an atc is right if the
 
03:59:42.630 --> 03:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
purpose of the atc is to serve their
 
03:59:42.640 --> 03:59:43.670 align:start position:0%
purpose of the atc is to serve their
patients

03:59:43.670 --> 03:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
patients
 
03:59:45.269 --> 03:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
then what this would do is give them a
 
03:59:46.630 --> 03:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
revenue stream where they would they
 
03:59:48.309 --> 03:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
would get an inc they'd be able to sell
 
03:59:49.750 --> 03:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
to the state for
 
03:59:51.750 --> 03:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
for more than it cost them to grow it
 
03:59:53.349 --> 03:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
and then roll that money back in for the
 
03:59:54.550 --> 03:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
benefit of their patients which is
 
03:59:56.950 --> 03:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
what's required under 126x
 
03:59:58.389 --> 03:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't give them a profit no
 
03:59:59.510 --> 03:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
one's going to write a check to them and
 
04:00:00.309 --> 04:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
they're going to get profits and
 
04:00:01.510 --> 04:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
dividends out of this but they're going
 
04:00:03.189 --> 04:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
to be able to make additional revenue to
 
04:00:05.030 --> 04:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
help set their true medical purpose
 
04:00:11.349 --> 04:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:11.359 --> 04:00:12.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:00:12.469 --> 04:00:12.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:00:12.479 --> 04:00:14.950 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

04:00:14.950 --> 04:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:00:16.550 --> 04:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:00:20.150 --> 04:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
the trouble with that is that 126x
 
04:00:23.110 --> 04:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
still exists in its entirety
 
04:00:23.120 --> 04:00:24.870 align:start position:0%
still exists in its entirety
and

04:00:24.870 --> 04:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:28.150 --> 04:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
as a non-profit they cannot get the bank
 
04:00:31.349 --> 04:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
loans to get the capital to expand that
 
04:00:33.590 --> 04:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
was what they were saying
 
04:00:33.600 --> 04:00:34.469 align:start position:0%
was what they were saying
um

04:00:34.469 --> 04:00:34.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:36.229 --> 04:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
so they would not be able to take
 
04:00:39.110 --> 04:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
advantage of this and also if they're
 
04:00:41.670 --> 04:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to do this here and not allowed
 
04:00:45.030 --> 04:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
to do this in 126x
 
04:00:45.040 --> 04:00:46.950 align:start position:0%
to do this in 126x
um

04:00:46.950 --> 04:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:50.550 --> 04:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
we will have the latest past legislation
 
04:00:52.550 --> 04:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
carries but it's going to be very
 
04:00:52.560 --> 04:00:56.469 align:start position:0%
carries but it's going to be very
confusing

04:00:56.469 --> 04:00:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:56.479 --> 04:00:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:00:57.830 --> 04:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:01:00.070 --> 04:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to say i agree with
 
04:01:01.590 --> 04:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative army it's really the
 
04:01:03.349 --> 04:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
reason they want this is really to raise
 
04:01:05.670 --> 04:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
capital as a for-profit it's a lot
 
04:01:07.670 --> 04:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
easier than for raised capital they can
 
04:01:09.590 --> 04:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
sell shares they can do all those kind
 
04:01:10.710 --> 04:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
of things depending on how they
 
04:01:13.110 --> 04:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
structure themselves as a for-profit
 
04:01:15.830 --> 04:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's my recollection of the debates
 
04:01:17.429 --> 04:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
well we had that in the marijuana
 
04:01:19.590 --> 04:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
commission as well those discussions it
 
04:01:23.110 --> 04:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
was all about raising capital um and
 
04:01:24.469 --> 04:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
if they stay the way they are they won't
 
04:01:26.309 --> 04:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
be able to so if we wanted to double or
 
04:01:26.319 --> 04:01:27.590 align:start position:0%
be able to so if we wanted to double or
triple

04:01:27.590 --> 04:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
triple
 
04:01:27.600 --> 04:01:28.710 align:start position:0%
triple
their

04:01:28.710 --> 04:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:01:31.349 --> 04:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
their capacity to grow
 
04:01:33.110 --> 04:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
and they want to they want to do it
 
04:01:35.910 --> 04:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
under those kind of not tents but those
 
04:01:39.189 --> 04:01:39.199 align:start position:0%
outside under those um
 
04:01:40.630 --> 04:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
whatever they are
 
04:01:42.309 --> 04:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
the plastic things or even if they want
 
04:01:44.070 --> 04:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
to buy more space
 
04:01:45.590 --> 04:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
the greenhouse thank you
 
04:01:47.189 --> 04:01:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh the uh
 
04:01:49.269 --> 04:01:49.279 align:start position:0%
even if they wanted to buy more space to
 
04:01:50.870 --> 04:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
put lights and buy the lights and all
 
04:01:53.590 --> 04:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
that they need to raise money
 
04:01:55.910 --> 04:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
and not for profit yeah you can put some
 
04:01:58.710 --> 04:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
money back into your thing but i i
 
04:02:00.710 --> 04:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
i think it's really about raising money
 
04:02:02.950 --> 04:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
is what they want
 
04:02:04.710 --> 04:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
mr chair i i guess it'd be the first
 
04:02:06.150 --> 04:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
time i've ever heard of not-for-profit
 
04:02:08.070 --> 04:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
in this state can't get a loan
 
04:02:12.630 --> 04:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:15.590 --> 04:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
right raising capital through
 
04:02:16.710 --> 04:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
shares and those kind of things but they
 
04:02:18.469 --> 04:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
can get loans if they want to expand
 
04:02:19.750 --> 04:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
their facility they could use the
 
04:02:19.760 --> 04:02:20.630 align:start position:0%
their facility they could use the
banking

04:02:20.630 --> 04:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
banking
 
04:02:22.150 --> 04:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
provisions we've put in here plus
 
04:02:24.229 --> 04:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
otherwise and the current banking model
 
04:02:25.830 --> 04:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
that they have be able to get loans to
 
04:02:27.590 --> 04:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
be able to expand facilities and expand
 
04:02:29.750 --> 04:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
production they can't get it as a you
 
04:02:31.990 --> 04:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
know an ipo
 
04:02:33.510 --> 04:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
so to speak but they could get it
 
04:02:34.950 --> 04:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
through through
 
04:02:37.189 --> 04:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
normal banking loan procedures again
 
04:02:39.510 --> 04:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
this is in theory this is about to the
 
04:02:41.110 --> 04:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
benefit of their patient that's their
 
04:02:42.950 --> 04:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
mission is to the benefit of their
 
04:02:45.429 --> 04:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
patients in the first line of 126x about
 
04:02:46.790 --> 04:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
them being a not-for-profit for the
 
04:02:48.790 --> 04:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
benefit of their patients
 
04:02:48.800 --> 04:02:49.670 align:start position:0%
benefit of their patients
again

04:02:49.670 --> 04:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:02:51.189 --> 04:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
mr chair uh
 
04:02:52.950 --> 04:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
tim oh i was just parodying what i
 
04:02:54.469 --> 04:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
thought i heard
 
04:02:57.429 --> 04:02:57.439 align:start position:0%
that they that the uh atc's the reason
 
04:02:59.189 --> 04:02:59.199 align:start position:0%
they wanted the atc is can shake your
 
04:03:00.630 --> 04:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
head up and down or
 
04:03:05.910 --> 04:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:07.110 --> 04:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure where we're at mr
 
04:03:08.870 --> 04:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
speaker are we getting more confused
 
04:03:11.110 --> 04:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so again
 
04:03:13.110 --> 04:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
my inclination was i don't care which
 
04:03:14.229 --> 04:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
way we go whether we make it a
 
04:03:16.710 --> 04:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
for-profit or not-for-profit um the
 
04:03:18.950 --> 04:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
language that if we were to strike a
 
04:03:21.189 --> 04:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
separate entity and a separate location
 
04:03:22.830 --> 04:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
would allow them to use their existing
 
04:03:25.269 --> 04:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
facilities and do a not withstanding
 
04:03:28.309 --> 04:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
language on 126x and say that they can
 
04:03:31.030 --> 04:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
also parallel this and use it to raise
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
revenue raise their revenue to be used
 
04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:38.389 --> 04:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
is this one
 
04:03:41.429 --> 04:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
so that way if they did that
 
04:03:43.510 --> 04:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
they could do both and keep the
 
04:03:45.990 --> 04:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
facilities separate
 
04:03:48.150 --> 04:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
well if we if if we struck the entity in
 
04:03:49.590 --> 04:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
separate facilities then they could
 
04:03:51.189 --> 04:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
currently use their current facilities
 
04:03:53.590 --> 04:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
and assign a portion of that crop so to
 
04:03:54.710 --> 04:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
04:03:56.710 --> 04:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
um to the state sale in a portion to the
 
04:03:58.870 --> 04:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
medical sale if they had if they had uh
 
04:04:02.150 --> 04:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
extra so again um or they would have to
 
04:04:04.229 --> 04:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
open and open another greenhouse and go
 
04:04:05.830 --> 04:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
get a loan and say hey look we're going
 
04:04:07.349 --> 04:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
to sell to the state we have a license
 
04:04:08.870 --> 04:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
to the state we need to build more
 
04:04:10.950 --> 04:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities we want a loan
 
04:04:12.070 --> 04:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
and we're going to pay for it by the
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
revenues from the state which is be a
 
04:04:15.590 --> 04:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
normal business operating expense which
 
04:04:17.429 --> 04:04:17.439 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to deduct out of their
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
revenues so they could still have access
 
04:04:23.429 --> 04:04:23.439 align:start position:0%
to capital via loan process as well as
 
04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
the access to the revenue to be able to
 
04:04:27.030 --> 04:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
pay for that and to create still profit
 
04:04:30.790 --> 04:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:32.870 --> 04:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i believe that
 
04:04:32.880 --> 04:04:33.670 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i believe that
um

04:04:33.670 --> 04:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:35.750 --> 04:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
the the members from the atcs that were
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
here did say
 
04:04:39.510 --> 04:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
make uh allude to the fact of ramping up
 
04:04:40.870 --> 04:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
04:04:44.790 --> 04:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:46.950 --> 04:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
so i i don't know if they would be able
 
04:04:49.349 --> 04:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
to hold be able to have the quantity
 
04:04:50.710 --> 04:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
needed for the state in their current
 
04:04:50.720 --> 04:04:51.830 align:start position:0%
needed for the state in their current
operation

04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
operation
 
04:04:53.030 --> 04:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
because i believe their current
 
04:04:54.389 --> 04:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
operations are limited to what their
 
04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:59.830 --> 04:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
if you want to if you want to come and
 
04:04:59.840 --> 04:05:04.150 align:start position:0%
if you want to if you want to come and
say

04:05:04.150 --> 04:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:06.469 --> 04:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
just like to add one thing it is
 
04:05:09.349 --> 04:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
incredibly hard for cannabis businesses
 
04:05:12.150 --> 04:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
to get any kind of loan
 
04:05:14.870 --> 04:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
to spend anything
 
04:05:16.389 --> 04:05:16.399 align:start position:0%
very difficult don't assume that it's
 
04:05:18.710 --> 04:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
like any other business because it isn't
 
04:05:20.710 --> 04:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
if they do if cannabis businesses are
 
04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
able to get loans it is at very high
 
04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
interest rates and very very unfavorable
 
04:05:24.800 --> 04:05:25.830 align:start position:0%
interest rates and very very unfavorable
terms

04:05:25.830 --> 04:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
terms
 
04:05:29.670 --> 04:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh putting such entities at a massive
 
04:05:31.349 --> 04:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
competitive disadvantage against large
 
04:05:31.359 --> 04:05:32.710 align:start position:0%
competitive disadvantage against large
for-profit

04:05:32.710 --> 04:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
for-profit
 
04:05:38.950 --> 04:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:50.229 --> 04:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:52.870 --> 04:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
if you were a businessman
 
04:05:52.880 --> 04:05:53.910 align:start position:0%
if you were a businessman
and

04:05:53.910 --> 04:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:56.070 --> 04:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
you had to deal with this issue
 
04:06:02.630 --> 04:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:04.710 --> 04:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
no can i say interject one thing can i
 
04:06:04.720 --> 04:06:05.670 align:start position:0%
no can i say interject one thing can i
just

04:06:05.670 --> 04:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:06:07.510 --> 04:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
let somebody else yes
 
04:06:07.520 --> 04:06:08.790 align:start position:0%
let somebody else yes
so

04:06:08.790 --> 04:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:06:11.510 --> 04:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
to do plan b or plan c we said the first
 
04:06:14.389 --> 04:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
thing no the second one do what what tim
 
04:06:15.910 --> 04:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
said to do
 
04:06:17.110 --> 04:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:06:18.630 --> 04:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
is a starting point but i don't think if
 
04:06:20.550 --> 04:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
we wanted to do true
 
04:06:22.950 --> 04:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh having them be for-profits
 
04:06:25.269 --> 04:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
i don't think we have time to do that
 
04:06:26.550 --> 04:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
between now and
 
04:06:28.389 --> 04:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
i think it's more complicated
 
04:06:30.389 --> 04:06:30.399 align:start position:0%
and that that would be something that we
 
04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
could introduce in the senate um
 
04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
that's just my thought on it i don't
 
04:06:35.279 --> 04:06:36.070 align:start position:0%
that's just my thought on it i don't
know

04:06:36.070 --> 04:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:06:37.910 --> 04:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
do you tim do you have a sense that the
 
04:06:39.429 --> 04:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
drafter could come up with something
 
04:06:41.110 --> 04:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's well
 
04:06:43.830 --> 04:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
what i changed in here was i put
 
04:06:46.229 --> 04:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
in in the in the first sentence i put
 
04:06:48.389 --> 04:06:48.399 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the provisions of rsa
 
04:06:50.710 --> 04:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
126x meaning that if they prohibit it we
 
04:06:52.830 --> 04:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
allow it we allow it overrides they
 
04:06:55.510 --> 04:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
prohibit i so i put notwithstanding rsa
 
04:06:57.590 --> 04:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
126x an alternative treatment center
 
04:07:00.550 --> 04:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
registered operate pursuant to 126x may
 
04:07:03.510 --> 04:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
apply for and may apply
 
04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
may file an application to obtain a
 
04:07:07.510 --> 04:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
separate registration to operate as a
 
04:07:09.990 --> 04:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
for-profit cannabis cultivation facility
 
04:07:11.670 --> 04:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis product manufacturing facility
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
or cannabis blah blah so it says
 
04:07:15.830 --> 04:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with that i'm okay with
 
04:07:21.110 --> 04:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:24.870 --> 04:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any objection to that
 
04:07:24.880 --> 04:07:26.790 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any objection to that
okay

04:07:26.790 --> 04:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:07:30.550 --> 04:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:32.630 --> 04:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
what's that is that making
 
04:07:34.710 --> 04:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman was that
 
04:07:37.030 --> 04:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
language going to make make the atc's
 
04:07:39.910 --> 04:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:41.510 --> 04:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
it would mean they would have to file a
 
04:07:43.030 --> 04:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
separate for-profit entity we've heard
 
04:07:45.110 --> 04:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
that not-for-profits can own for-profit
 
04:07:47.110 --> 04:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
entities so they'd file a for-profit
 
04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
entity underneath the not-for-profit and
 
04:07:50.710 --> 04:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to raise funds and
 
04:07:52.950 --> 04:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
capital through that
 
04:07:54.950 --> 04:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
mr jim if i may follow up
 
04:07:57.110 --> 04:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
does any does anyone know and
 
04:07:59.110 --> 04:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
for free to provide any input
 
04:08:01.990 --> 04:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
do any of the current atc
 
04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities on the existing
 
04:08:06.229 --> 04:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
property have the ability to increase
 
04:08:06.239 --> 04:08:16.389 align:start position:0%
property have the ability to increase
production

04:08:16.389 --> 04:08:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:21.590 --> 04:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
let's take a straw poll are we
 
04:08:23.590 --> 04:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
those are in favor
 
04:08:29.910 --> 04:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:33.910 --> 04:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:36.389 --> 04:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
let's go on to another
 
04:08:38.870 --> 04:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:08:41.750 --> 04:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
i believe this make sure i believe that
 
04:08:56.309 --> 04:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:59.189 --> 04:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
and mr chair if i recall i have nothing
 
04:08:59.199 --> 04:09:00.550 align:start position:0%
and mr chair if i recall i have nothing
after

04:09:00.550 --> 04:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
after
 
04:09:02.950 --> 04:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh 10 because now we're starting to get
 
04:09:05.110 --> 04:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
into um
 
04:09:05.120 --> 04:09:06.229 align:start position:0%
into um
wow

04:09:06.229 --> 04:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
wow
 
04:09:08.070 --> 04:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
10 i didn't have anything
 
04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
on i don't believe we look through real
 
04:09:09.600 --> 04:09:12.870 align:start position:0%
on i don't believe we look through real
quick

04:09:12.870 --> 04:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:16.630 --> 04:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:18.950 --> 04:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
page 14. right so i'm sorry but i would
 
04:09:20.790 --> 04:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
just i didn't when we get to page 11
 
04:09:22.149 --> 04:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
we're really starting to talk about the
 
04:09:23.830 --> 04:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
legalization aspect that i didn't touch
 
04:09:25.429 --> 04:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
any of that language
 
04:09:28.790 --> 04:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
the last section is on page 14 where i
 
04:09:30.149 --> 04:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
did change
 
04:09:33.030 --> 04:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
the amount of appropriation to 4.6
 
04:09:42.149 --> 04:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:44.710 --> 04:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
and that's the only change on 14. that's
 
04:09:50.229 --> 04:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:51.990 --> 04:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative tucker
 
04:09:54.950 --> 04:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative lang did you make
 
04:09:57.429 --> 04:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
any changes in your thinking
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
not necessarily
 
04:10:00.790 --> 04:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
with ols yet
 
04:10:04.070 --> 04:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
and changing the allocations
 
04:10:06.870 --> 04:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
so specifically i think that dialogue or
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
discussion now that we've all had lunch
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
so a break might be worth continuing
 
04:10:12.790 --> 04:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
i'll be honest with you i thought about
 
04:10:14.710 --> 04:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
what we talked about and i'm not
 
04:10:16.790 --> 04:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
inclined to my my
 
04:10:18.309 --> 04:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
my position is i wouldn't want to change
 
04:10:20.630 --> 04:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
those allocations we've done allocations
 
04:10:22.550 --> 04:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
like that before it while it's not
 
04:10:25.590 --> 04:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
common it's also not unique either
 
04:10:27.269 --> 04:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
i think back to my sports betting bill
 
04:10:30.469 --> 04:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
14 480 last term
 
04:10:32.550 --> 04:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
we specifically identified all the
 
04:10:34.790 --> 04:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
revenue to go to education all of it we
 
04:10:36.389 --> 04:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
didn't put it in the general trust fund
 
04:10:37.429 --> 04:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
which we could have done because it's
 
04:10:40.070 --> 04:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
not a lottery it's not a lottery uh
 
04:10:41.670 --> 04:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
powerball megabucks those kind of things
 
04:10:43.990 --> 04:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
which are obligated by our constitution
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
however we just put lottery as the
 
04:10:47.830 --> 04:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
regulatory agency so we could have
 
04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
easily left that as general fund money
 
04:10:51.269 --> 04:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
but we chose to put that directly to
 
04:10:53.590 --> 04:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
education so again it's not an uncommon
 
04:10:56.309 --> 04:10:56.319 align:start position:0%
thing that we do um that we we put
 
04:10:59.110 --> 04:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
products we put revenue to specific
 
04:10:59.120 --> 04:10:59.990 align:start position:0%
products we put revenue to specific
things

04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:11:01.510 --> 04:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
i think if we're gonna you know again
 
04:11:03.670 --> 04:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's my opinion and and
 
04:11:05.590 --> 04:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
i think if we're going to open this up
 
04:11:06.790 --> 04:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
and we're going to create a revenue
 
04:11:08.790 --> 04:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
stream new to the state to give the
 
04:11:10.149 --> 04:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
citizens what they want remember we're
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
doing this because 78 of our citizens
 
04:11:13.670 --> 04:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
want legalization right so that's the
 
04:11:15.429 --> 04:11:15.439 align:start position:0%
reason we're doing it then i want to
 
04:11:17.110 --> 04:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
return the profit back to the citizens
 
04:11:18.790 --> 04:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
if if the state's going to take this
 
04:11:20.870 --> 04:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
this onus on then whatever we have extra
 
04:11:22.309 --> 04:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
we should be giving back to our citizens
 
04:11:24.309 --> 04:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
as a profit share for lack of a bit of
 
04:11:24.319 --> 04:11:25.189 align:start position:0%
as a profit share for lack of a bit of
phrase

04:11:25.189 --> 04:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
phrase
 
04:11:28.389 --> 04:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
so can i do a follow-up sure mr chairman
 
04:11:28.399 --> 04:11:29.750 align:start position:0%
so can i do a follow-up sure mr chairman
so

04:11:29.750 --> 04:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:32.309 --> 04:11:32.319 align:start position:0%
i'm quite persuaded that the reason this
 
04:11:34.630 --> 04:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
bill of his interest to me
 
04:11:36.870 --> 04:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
is one that the criminal justice
 
04:11:39.349 --> 04:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
committee talks about which is that
 
04:11:42.149 --> 04:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
marginalized peoples vulnerable peoples
 
04:11:44.469 --> 04:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
special populations
 
04:11:46.870 --> 04:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
get more criminal records than they
 
04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
should because of the consuming
 
04:11:52.229 --> 04:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
or selling of marijuana
 
04:11:54.389 --> 04:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
that seems to be the umbrella
 
04:11:54.399 --> 04:11:55.189 align:start position:0%
that seems to be the umbrella
so

04:11:55.189 --> 04:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:57.269 --> 04:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
it confuses me a little bit now that
 
04:11:58.950 --> 04:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
04:12:03.030 --> 04:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's for the revenues for the populace
 
04:12:05.429 --> 04:12:05.439 align:start position:0%
who want lower property taxes or
 
04:12:05.439 --> 04:12:08.070 align:start position:0%
who want lower property taxes or
whatever

04:12:08.070 --> 04:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:10.389 --> 04:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
i feel a lot more comfortable
 
04:12:12.630 --> 04:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
with discussing the
 
04:12:14.229 --> 04:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
sale of
 
04:12:16.550 --> 04:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis by the state
 
04:12:19.030 --> 04:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
if it's to solve a problem
 
04:12:20.070 --> 04:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
of us
 
04:12:22.309 --> 04:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
leaving people with the wrong kind of
 
04:12:22.319 --> 04:12:23.670 align:start position:0%
leaving people with the wrong kind of
record

04:12:23.670 --> 04:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
record
 
04:12:25.429 --> 04:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
as they go out into the world looking
 
04:12:28.229 --> 04:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
for work or education or to become a
 
04:12:28.239 --> 04:12:29.269 align:start position:0%
for work or education or to become a
lawyer

04:12:29.269 --> 04:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
04:12:31.349 --> 04:12:31.359 align:start position:0%
you know where they look to see whether
 
04:12:33.349 --> 04:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
you have a felony charge on your
 
04:12:33.359 --> 04:12:34.870 align:start position:0%
you have a felony charge on your
background

04:12:34.870 --> 04:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
background
 
04:12:37.269 --> 04:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
so i i see it i guess a little in
 
04:12:37.279 --> 04:12:38.389 align:start position:0%
so i i see it i guess a little in
conflict

04:12:38.389 --> 04:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
04:12:40.070 --> 04:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
to start
 
04:12:41.910 --> 04:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
allocating the revenues to so many
 
04:12:43.590 --> 04:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
different areas
 
04:12:44.870 --> 04:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
when the real
 
04:12:47.750 --> 04:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
my belief is that i believe criminal
 
04:12:49.990 --> 04:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
justice that that is why the bill is
 
04:12:52.630 --> 04:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
here so i see those two things slight
 
04:12:54.790 --> 04:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
not exactly conflict
 
04:12:54.800 --> 04:12:55.990 align:start position:0%
not exactly conflict
but

04:12:55.990 --> 04:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:12:59.510 --> 04:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
not fitting together well
 
04:13:01.990 --> 04:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
i i i understand your point again i i
 
04:13:05.670 --> 04:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
look at it as the citizens are are
 
04:13:07.349 --> 04:13:07.359 align:start position:0%
taking the risk for like a bit of phrase
 
04:13:08.550 --> 04:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
right we don't still know what this is
 
04:13:09.590 --> 04:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
going to look like
 
04:13:10.950 --> 04:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:13:10.960 --> 04:13:12.790 align:start position:0%
um and
i

04:13:12.790 --> 04:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:13:14.229 --> 04:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
blackberry phrase i don't want this to
 
04:13:16.309 --> 04:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
go someplace it if we're going to do it
 
04:13:18.149 --> 04:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
let's let's give tax relief right if
 
04:13:19.670 --> 04:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to create new revenue a new
 
04:13:21.189 --> 04:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
revenue stream for the state let's give
 
04:13:22.870 --> 04:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
tax relief rather than just spend it on
 
04:13:24.950 --> 04:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
some other program right
 
04:13:27.670 --> 04:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's my general opinion we we we we
 
04:13:29.590 --> 04:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
should be if we're doing this for the 78
 
04:13:30.870 --> 04:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
of the citizens and let's give the
 
04:13:34.950 --> 04:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
citizens back some money uh uh um
 
04:13:37.110 --> 04:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i i don't know how to say i know we
 
04:13:38.469 --> 04:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
disagree we're just going to disagree i
 
04:13:40.229 --> 04:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
just i don't know i didn't want it to be
 
04:13:41.910 --> 04:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
just it gets thrown into the general
 
04:13:43.830 --> 04:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
fund and then somebody's pet project
 
04:13:45.269 --> 04:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
gets picked up and says we've got 30
 
04:13:46.630 --> 04:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
million extra revenue here what we're
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
going to spend it on and it doesn't go
 
04:13:50.389 --> 04:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
to anything we want it doesn't go to any
 
04:13:52.389 --> 04:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
cessation programs it just ends up over
 
04:13:54.070 --> 04:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
in the general pool and and the money
 
04:13:56.229 --> 04:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
gets spent on some ad program program
 
04:13:57.910 --> 04:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
for the department of transportation to
 
04:13:58.870 --> 04:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:14:00.149 --> 04:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
for for the
 
04:14:02.149 --> 04:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
highways highway safety something right
 
04:14:04.070 --> 04:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
and so and then it didn't help anybody
 
04:14:05.670 --> 04:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
right it's just more money more spending
 
04:14:07.349 --> 04:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
in the state so i was trying to make
 
04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
sure that if we're going to do something
 
04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
for our citizens we're going to they're
 
04:14:11.990 --> 04:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
going to see a direct benefit right from
 
04:14:14.469 --> 04:14:14.479 align:start position:0%
day one out of this program that every
 
04:14:15.590 --> 04:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
citizen in the state of new hampshire
 
04:14:17.910 --> 04:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
can do it i'll be honest with you if i i
 
04:14:19.349 --> 04:14:19.359 align:start position:0%
represented abbess and i had this
 
04:14:21.269 --> 04:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
conversation i'd had a policy issue in
 
04:14:22.469 --> 04:14:22.479 align:start position:0%
here that says that everything that's
 
04:14:24.790 --> 04:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
made legal by this process results in
 
04:14:26.149 --> 04:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
automatic annulment of all prior
 
04:14:26.159 --> 04:14:27.269 align:start position:0%
automatic annulment of all prior
convictions

04:14:27.269 --> 04:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
convictions
 
04:14:29.030 --> 04:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
right that's a reasonable thing to do if
 
04:14:29.910 --> 04:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to make it legal now then
 
04:14:31.349 --> 04:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
why someone who got convicted two years
 
04:14:32.630 --> 04:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
ago still have it on their record they
 
04:14:33.830 --> 04:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
should be able to get it off but that's
 
04:14:35.590 --> 04:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
a major policy change so i can't add
 
04:14:37.830 --> 04:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
that in here as much as i'd like to
 
04:14:37.840 --> 04:14:39.030 align:start position:0%
that in here as much as i'd like to
okay

04:14:39.030 --> 04:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:14:39.040 --> 04:14:40.550 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

04:14:40.550 --> 04:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:14:42.149 --> 04:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:14:44.550 --> 04:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
and just to touch on that
 
04:14:46.790 --> 04:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
i understand when there was annulment
 
04:14:48.790 --> 04:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
legislation in the past
 
04:14:50.710 --> 04:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
involving the nominal convictions
 
04:14:52.149 --> 04:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
related to cannabis that that was a
 
04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
strong point of contention
 
04:14:55.590 --> 04:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
the idea was to
 
04:14:57.830 --> 04:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
address that in in future legislation
 
04:14:59.830 --> 04:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
and not let this get held up on on that
 
04:15:01.590 --> 04:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
policy provision i'm i agree with you
 
04:15:03.269 --> 04:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
with i'm not talking about
 
04:15:05.349 --> 04:15:05.359 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about this so the overall
 
04:15:07.189 --> 04:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill
 
04:15:09.590 --> 04:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that in the future
 
04:15:11.590 --> 04:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
our youth particularly will not be
 
04:15:14.309 --> 04:15:14.319 align:start position:0%
handicapped by having criminal record
 
04:15:16.149 --> 04:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
which they don't deserve
 
04:15:16.159 --> 04:15:18.149 align:start position:0%
which they don't deserve
in

04:15:18.149 --> 04:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
but even if you have a conviction even
 
04:15:21.110 --> 04:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
if it's no longer a crime you still have
 
04:15:22.710 --> 04:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
to petition to the court for the
 
04:15:24.950 --> 04:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
annulment and the qualifications to get
 
04:15:26.469 --> 04:15:26.479 align:start position:0%
that annulment we didn't include that in
 
04:15:29.189 --> 04:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
this this legislation for that reason
 
04:15:30.469 --> 04:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
that we didn't want to get held up on
 
04:15:32.790 --> 04:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
that provision which we thought could be
 
04:15:34.870 --> 04:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
better served on a standalone that was
 
04:15:37.429 --> 04:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
what we discussed in criminal justice
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay i want to find out where we stand
 
04:15:43.429 --> 04:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:47.189 --> 04:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent helene
 
04:15:50.469 --> 04:15:50.479 align:start position:0%
the language on page 14
 
04:15:52.950 --> 04:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
the appropriation
 
04:15:56.950 --> 04:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:56.960 --> 04:15:58.830 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:15:58.830 --> 04:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:16:01.070 --> 04:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
the sum of
 
04:16:03.349 --> 04:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
4.6 million
 
04:16:03.359 --> 04:16:04.149 align:start position:0%
4.6 million
is

04:16:04.149 --> 04:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:16:07.710 --> 04:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
for the fiscal year ending june 30th
 
04:16:11.110 --> 04:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
2023 is appropriated
 
04:16:12.469 --> 04:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
does that
 
04:16:15.510 --> 04:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
mean as i think it means
 
04:16:18.389 --> 04:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
that it goes back to the general fund if
 
04:16:20.950 --> 04:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
they haven't spent all of it yet
 
04:16:25.670 --> 04:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
and are they going to be able in
 
04:16:28.870 --> 04:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
one year and maybe one month one year
 
04:16:28.880 --> 04:16:29.990 align:start position:0%
one year and maybe one month one year
probably

04:16:29.990 --> 04:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
probably
 
04:16:30.000 --> 04:16:31.429 align:start position:0%
probably
on

04:16:31.429 --> 04:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:16:31.439 --> 04:16:32.550 align:start position:0%
on
build

04:16:32.550 --> 04:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
build
 
04:16:35.349 --> 04:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
and open and get enough money from the
 
04:16:38.630 --> 04:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
first three stores
 
04:16:40.790 --> 04:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to pay it back and have money
 
04:16:42.950 --> 04:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
to continue going away because this is
 
04:16:45.670 --> 04:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:48.469 --> 04:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
sorry okay grab representative hatch so
 
04:16:50.870 --> 04:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
again i uh the money is allocated so for
 
04:16:52.870 --> 04:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
next year they can begin to do their
 
04:16:54.790 --> 04:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
stores um
 
04:16:56.950 --> 04:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
the uh reality is that we'll be in the
 
04:16:58.229 --> 04:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
middle of a budget cycle right after
 
04:16:59.910 --> 04:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
that right and so we're gonna give them
 
04:17:01.429 --> 04:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
money for basically the first six months
 
04:17:03.269 --> 04:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
but start january we're in a budget
 
04:17:05.269 --> 04:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
cycle to pass hb one and two all over
 
04:17:07.670 --> 04:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
again and and what happens and so the
 
04:17:09.910 --> 04:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
idea was to give them their their first
 
04:17:11.910 --> 04:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
three stores off the ground out of this
 
04:17:13.189 --> 04:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
year's in theory there is no
 
04:17:14.790 --> 04:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation for next year because it
 
04:17:16.870 --> 04:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
becomes a revolving fund at that point
 
04:17:18.070 --> 04:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
so it's a matter of giving them the
 
04:17:19.510 --> 04:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
money they need for the first six months
 
04:17:22.229 --> 04:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
to open the first three stores
 
04:17:22.239 --> 04:17:23.670 align:start position:0%
to open the first three stores
so

04:17:23.670 --> 04:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:17:26.389 --> 04:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
this money automatically it would
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
there's no lapsing language correct
 
04:17:31.110 --> 04:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing language correct would it go
 
04:17:31.120 --> 04:17:32.229 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing language correct would it go
into

04:17:32.229 --> 04:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
the revolving fund that would be it
 
04:17:35.830 --> 04:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
would be assigned to the cannabis
 
04:17:38.149 --> 04:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
control fund representative hatch who
 
04:17:38.159 --> 04:17:39.830 align:start position:0%
control fund representative hatch who
knows

04:17:39.830 --> 04:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
knows
 
04:17:39.840 --> 04:17:42.550 align:start position:0%
knows
that

04:17:42.550 --> 04:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:43.750 --> 04:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
wait let me start with the question
 
04:17:43.760 --> 04:17:44.950 align:start position:0%
wait let me start with the question
again

04:17:44.950 --> 04:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:17:47.110 --> 04:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
yeah on
 
04:17:47.120 --> 04:17:48.950 align:start position:0%
yeah on
if

04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:17:51.349 --> 04:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
4.6 million is
 
04:17:54.389 --> 04:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
appropriated for the fiscal year ending
 
04:17:57.510 --> 04:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
june thirtieth twenty twenty three and
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:12.790 --> 04:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:14.630 --> 04:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
there is non-lapsing language in here
 
04:18:16.070 --> 04:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's under the cannabis control fund
 
04:18:17.429 --> 04:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
which with their net operating costs
 
04:18:19.830 --> 04:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
fall out of so right in the first line
 
04:18:22.389 --> 04:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
of the creation of the non of the uh
 
04:18:24.229 --> 04:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
cannabis control fund says there is
 
04:18:26.469 --> 04:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
established state treasury a non-lapsing
 
04:18:28.309 --> 04:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
fund known to be the cannabis control
 
04:18:30.469 --> 04:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
fund it is on page
 
04:18:31.910 --> 04:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
look at page eight
 
04:18:33.510 --> 04:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh number
 
04:18:35.670 --> 04:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
well it's 1a
 
04:18:38.229 --> 04:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
um but we do create and then
 
04:18:38.239 --> 04:18:39.349 align:start position:0%
um but we do create and then
um

04:18:39.349 --> 04:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:44.309 --> 04:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:44.319 --> 04:18:45.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:18:45.030 --> 04:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
so it would not last so the 4.6 would go
 
04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
into the cannabis control fund then it
 
04:18:50.710 --> 04:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
would not lapse and they'd be able to
 
04:18:53.030 --> 04:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
use it for the creation of their stores
 
04:18:56.309 --> 04:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:56.319 --> 04:18:59.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:18:59.110 --> 04:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:00.950 --> 04:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's on the same basis
 
04:19:02.950 --> 04:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
everybody understands
 
04:19:06.309 --> 04:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
if you go to page 10 if you go to page 8
 
04:19:10.070 --> 04:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
line 30 35 and 36
 
04:19:13.269 --> 04:19:13.279 align:start position:0%
not later than june 30 2027 the
 
04:19:14.870 --> 04:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
commission shall reimburse the general
 
04:19:17.670 --> 04:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
fund from the cannabis control fund
 
04:19:19.750 --> 04:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
for any initial or set up funds
 
04:19:21.830 --> 04:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
appropriated to the commission for the
 
04:19:23.830 --> 04:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah okay
 
04:19:28.710 --> 04:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:31.030 --> 04:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
we can pay if we decide to or if the
 
04:19:33.110 --> 04:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
house decides to they can pay
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
they can pay this off all at one time or
 
04:19:37.590 --> 04:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily have to be paid
 
04:19:39.750 --> 04:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
back in any schedule is that correct
 
04:19:41.830 --> 04:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
that's correct we put a date in so that
 
04:19:43.269 --> 04:19:43.279 align:start position:0%
in the first few years they can keep
 
04:19:44.550 --> 04:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
more money to be able to open more
 
04:19:47.429 --> 04:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
stores but then the later years they can
 
04:19:48.469 --> 04:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:19:49.910 --> 04:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
basically a balloon payment to pay it
 
04:19:52.229 --> 04:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
off right i just want to make sure we
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:02.950 --> 04:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
correct they get they just get startup
 
04:20:04.229 --> 04:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
funds and then they have to pay back the
 
04:20:06.870 --> 04:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
startup funds
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
all right i want to know
 
04:20:12.790 --> 04:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
where do we stand on
 
04:20:14.229 --> 04:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
04:20:16.950 --> 04:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
relative to your changes
 
04:20:19.830 --> 04:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
so uh based on the the amendment you
 
04:20:22.149 --> 04:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
have in front of you i have one two
 
04:20:24.389 --> 04:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
three four five changes i'm proposing to
 
04:20:26.309 --> 04:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
that amendment
 
04:20:26.319 --> 04:20:27.510 align:start position:0%
that amendment
which

04:20:27.510 --> 04:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:20:29.349 --> 04:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
yep i'll review them real quick so based
 
04:20:36.950 --> 04:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:40.309 --> 04:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
so on from 11 52 the changes i have is
 
04:20:41.830 --> 04:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
at representative
 
04:20:41.840 --> 04:20:43.510 align:start position:0%
at representative
um

04:20:43.510 --> 04:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:45.670 --> 04:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
tucker's request i'm adding the word all
 
04:20:47.670 --> 04:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
in front of it so it reads all cannabis
 
04:20:50.870 --> 04:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
stores online on page 1 line 16 i'm
 
04:20:53.510 --> 04:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
changing letter d to read all cannabis
 
04:20:54.950 --> 04:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
stores shall be operated by the state of
 
04:20:56.070 --> 04:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:20:57.830 --> 04:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm adding that one
 
04:21:00.469 --> 04:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
on under the health and safety rules
 
04:21:02.790 --> 04:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
i'm changing that line to read
 
04:21:04.309 --> 04:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
hold on let me find it this is the one
 
04:21:06.469 --> 04:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative only had
 
04:21:10.070 --> 04:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
what requested it's on page six
 
04:21:12.229 --> 04:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
right near the top section
 
04:21:12.239 --> 04:21:13.349 align:start position:0%
right near the top section
um

04:21:13.349 --> 04:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:13.359 --> 04:21:15.670 align:start position:0%
um
seven

04:21:15.670 --> 04:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
seven
 
04:21:17.269 --> 04:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
and i'm just going to add it's going to
 
04:21:19.269 --> 04:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
say health and safety rules including
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
regarding the packaging and preparing of
 
04:21:23.910 --> 04:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis comma presence of contaminants
 
04:21:26.149 --> 04:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
comma and the re restricting the use of
 
04:21:27.590 --> 04:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
pesticides that may be dangerous to
 
04:21:30.309 --> 04:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis consumers so it just requires
 
04:21:32.070 --> 04:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
that they generate rules to deal with
 
04:21:34.790 --> 04:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
the presence of cat of contaminants
 
04:21:34.800 --> 04:21:35.429 align:start position:0%
the presence of cat of contaminants
and

04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:37.429 --> 04:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr real real quick um uh
 
04:21:38.630 --> 04:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative lang should that say
 
04:21:41.030 --> 04:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis products
 
04:21:42.710 --> 04:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
to be consistent with the changes for
 
04:21:48.229 --> 04:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:51.349 --> 04:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
and then on that same page line i'm not
 
04:21:52.550 --> 04:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
sure what line it is it's the
 
04:21:54.790 --> 04:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
requirements for testing
 
04:21:56.950 --> 04:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh i've changed it to read requirements
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
for the testing requirements for testing
 
04:22:01.030 --> 04:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
of all cannabis
 
04:22:04.550 --> 04:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
products including for potency so
 
04:22:06.149 --> 04:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
requires them to test all the products
 
04:22:12.229 --> 04:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:14.550 --> 04:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
what was that representative
 
04:22:16.710 --> 04:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
yeah we i added the rules up and above
 
04:22:16.720 --> 04:22:17.910 align:start position:0%
yeah we i added the rules up and above
this

04:22:17.910 --> 04:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:22:20.790 --> 04:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
this is saying that testing
 
04:22:23.349 --> 04:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
would include potency and contamination
 
04:22:25.830 --> 04:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
i can do that it's fine that's not a
 
04:22:34.550 --> 04:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:36.229 --> 04:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
so that line will now read requirements
 
04:22:37.670 --> 04:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
for testing on all cannabis products for
 
04:22:41.510 --> 04:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:44.469 --> 04:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
then if we go down to page 10 i believe
 
04:22:46.950 --> 04:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
line round line 18. let me see if i can
 
04:22:51.830 --> 04:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:53.750 --> 04:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
what do you have in section six
 
04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
no i'm leaving i'm leaving uh that's
 
04:22:57.510 --> 04:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
i'll get to that one i'm sorry it's not
 
04:22:59.030 --> 04:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
on that
 
04:23:01.510 --> 04:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
so on page on page six i have the
 
04:23:03.670 --> 04:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
provision for the atcs where i said
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding rsa126x and i'll turn
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
the treatment center registered pursuant
 
04:23:08.880 --> 04:23:09.750 align:start position:0%
the treatment center registered pursuant
to

04:23:09.750 --> 04:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:23:12.149 --> 04:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh pursuant to rsa126x may file for an
 
04:23:14.469 --> 04:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
application to obtain a separate
 
04:23:16.950 --> 04:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
registration operate as a for-profit
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis cultivation and the rest of
 
04:23:21.110 --> 04:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's all the same so i just added the in
 
04:23:23.429 --> 04:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
the front i added notwithstanding 126x
 
04:23:29.269 --> 04:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:31.990 --> 04:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
well we i think we left it i think we we
 
04:23:33.110 --> 04:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
said we're going to leave it that way
 
04:23:35.670 --> 04:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
because we realize they can run
 
04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
they can have a for-profit component
 
04:23:39.510 --> 04:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
underneath their not-for-profit
 
04:23:39.520 --> 04:23:44.389 align:start position:0%
underneath their not-for-profit
organization

04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:46.070 --> 04:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
i okay with striking that separate
 
04:23:51.990 --> 04:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:54.550 --> 04:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
president tucker yes i wondered whether
 
04:23:56.550 --> 04:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
we could ask
 
04:23:59.030 --> 04:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
the person who really knows about atc's
 
04:24:01.110 --> 04:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
to comment on this now that we have this
 
04:24:07.590 --> 04:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:09.189 --> 04:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
get to get his
 
04:24:12.309 --> 04:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
first take on the wording
 
04:24:13.990 --> 04:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll just be very brief we've
 
04:24:16.149 --> 04:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
run this by our the previous draft by
 
04:24:17.510 --> 04:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
our attorneys i haven't heard back from
 
04:24:19.030 --> 04:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
them yet i'm expecting to get on the
 
04:24:20.710 --> 04:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
phone with them later this afternoon
 
04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's above my pay grade so i still don't
 
04:24:24.870 --> 04:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
really understand whether this is
 
04:24:27.189 --> 04:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
workable or not from our perspective it
 
04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
might be
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
i'll get back to you as soon as i can
 
04:24:30.000 --> 04:24:30.950 align:start position:0%
i'll get back to you as soon as i can
okay

04:24:30.950 --> 04:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:24:33.349 --> 04:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:24:36.830 --> 04:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
and then lastly mr chair online
 
04:24:42.389 --> 04:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:43.910 --> 04:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
the authorization language i think it's
 
04:24:45.030 --> 04:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
in 10.
 
04:24:46.229 --> 04:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
let me find it
 
04:24:53.030 --> 04:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:55.030 --> 04:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
commission rule making commission to
 
04:24:55.040 --> 04:24:56.149 align:start position:0%
commission rule making commission to
sell

04:24:56.149 --> 04:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
sell
 
04:24:59.429 --> 04:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
so um so under section on line 11 i
 
04:25:00.630 --> 04:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
believe it is
 
04:25:00.640 --> 04:25:03.189 align:start position:0%
believe it is
um

04:25:03.189 --> 04:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:04.870 --> 04:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to change that line let me
 
04:25:09.670 --> 04:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:11.349 --> 04:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
so we're just going to change that line
 
04:25:12.790 --> 04:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
basically make it clear that we're
 
04:25:14.469 --> 04:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
allowing themself
 
04:25:16.870 --> 04:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis products allowed by the statute
 
04:25:19.110 --> 04:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
as well as therapeut therapeutic
 
04:25:20.950 --> 04:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis products allowed by the people
 
04:25:22.710 --> 04:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
with only with therapeutic cards under
 
04:25:24.630 --> 04:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
rsa 126x
 
04:25:26.550 --> 04:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
so again it allows
 
04:25:28.309 --> 04:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
them to this is that differential it
 
04:25:29.510 --> 04:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
says under
 
04:25:32.710 --> 04:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
under the retail side you can only sell
 
04:25:34.950 --> 04:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
everything but edibles but on the you
 
04:25:36.790 --> 04:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
can have a case of edibles but they can
 
04:25:37.910 --> 04:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
only be sold to people with a
 
04:25:41.269 --> 04:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:43.750 --> 04:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
and we're changing um the
 
04:25:45.830 --> 04:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
the medicinal
 
04:25:51.750 --> 04:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:53.030 --> 04:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
and that's it that's all of them that's
 
04:25:54.550 --> 04:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
all the changes we have for this last
 
04:25:57.429 --> 04:25:57.439 align:start position:0%
amendment i'm going to send in
 
04:25:58.790 --> 04:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
there was something
 
04:26:00.950 --> 04:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
else that everybody i thought had agreed
 
04:26:03.429 --> 04:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
with that you'd have to do a search and
 
04:26:06.149 --> 04:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
replace where cannabis should be
 
04:26:08.469 --> 04:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
cannabis products
 
04:26:08.479 --> 04:26:11.349 align:start position:0%
cannabis products
correct

04:26:11.349 --> 04:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:11.359 --> 04:26:12.870 align:start position:0%
 
represent

04:26:12.870 --> 04:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:26:12.880 --> 04:26:14.630 align:start position:0%
represent
avis

04:26:14.630 --> 04:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
avis
 
04:26:16.550 --> 04:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:26:18.229 --> 04:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
i i'm kind of going back and forth in my
 
04:26:19.990 --> 04:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
head i understand why
 
04:26:21.990 --> 04:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
having it read cannabis products but
 
04:26:23.670 --> 04:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
maybe it should say cannabis and
 
04:26:25.110 --> 04:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis products because in the
 
04:26:26.710 --> 04:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
definition section
 
04:26:28.550 --> 04:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
is the definition of cannabis and then
 
04:26:29.750 --> 04:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
there's a definition of cannabis
 
04:26:32.630 --> 04:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
products i think including both
 
04:26:34.870 --> 04:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think would be a problem
 
04:26:37.510 --> 04:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
and i just i'm cautious by saying just
 
04:26:39.990 --> 04:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis products are we then losing
 
04:26:42.229 --> 04:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
then i would interpret that to exclude
 
04:26:44.149 --> 04:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
the definition of cannabis so say
 
04:26:45.990 --> 04:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis and cannabis products and
 
04:26:47.510 --> 04:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's what i put i just change it based
 
04:26:49.990 --> 04:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
on that comment
 
04:26:52.469 --> 04:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
be careful be careful
 
04:26:52.479 --> 04:26:54.309 align:start position:0%
be careful be careful
cannabis

04:26:54.309 --> 04:26:54.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
04:27:04.950 --> 04:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:06.229 --> 04:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
let me just read the division of
 
04:27:06.239 --> 04:27:10.630 align:start position:0%
let me just read the division of
cannabis

04:27:10.630 --> 04:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:10.640 --> 04:27:11.590 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:27:11.590 --> 04:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:27:15.030 --> 04:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
roman two on page two
 
04:27:17.670 --> 04:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
implicitly says that
 
04:27:21.910 --> 04:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
on food drink or other product
 
04:27:21.920 --> 04:27:23.189 align:start position:0%
on food drink or other product
is

04:27:23.189 --> 04:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:27:26.229 --> 04:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
part of cannabis
 
04:27:26.239 --> 04:27:27.030 align:start position:0%
part of cannabis
so

04:27:27.030 --> 04:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:27:29.269 --> 04:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
this is a this is if we have an english
 
04:27:31.750 --> 04:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
teacher in the room um
 
04:27:34.710 --> 04:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
when i read this this is two sentences
 
04:27:36.950 --> 04:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
the first one talks about cannabis
 
04:27:39.110 --> 04:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
and then it says cannabis shall not
 
04:27:41.429 --> 04:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
include in the entire second sentence
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
04:27:42.720 --> 04:27:43.590 align:start position:0%
yeah so
my

04:27:43.590 --> 04:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:27:45.510 --> 04:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
the way i read this
 
04:27:47.189 --> 04:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
was that under the definition of
 
04:27:47.199 --> 04:27:48.469 align:start position:0%
was that under the definition of
cannabis

04:27:48.469 --> 04:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
04:27:50.389 --> 04:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't include these other things
 
04:27:52.309 --> 04:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
it does include hemp doesn't include
 
04:27:54.790 --> 04:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
fiber produced from the stocks oil or
 
04:27:57.030 --> 04:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
cake made from the seeds of the plant it
 
04:27:58.870 --> 04:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't include sterilized seeds of the
 
04:28:00.870 --> 04:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
plant that are incapable of germination
 
04:28:02.469 --> 04:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
it doesn't include the weight of any
 
04:28:04.870 --> 04:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
other ingredient combined with cannabis
 
04:28:07.349 --> 04:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
to prepare topical oral food a drink or
 
04:28:09.510 --> 04:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
other products so it's weird because the
 
04:28:11.830 --> 04:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
phrase they use is
 
04:28:14.710 --> 04:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
or the weight of any other ingredient
 
04:28:16.790 --> 04:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
yes and what it means brownies and
 
04:28:18.950 --> 04:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
things like that right
 
04:28:21.030 --> 04:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
would not be included in the definition
 
04:28:22.950 --> 04:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
of cannabis which is okay because we're
 
04:28:25.269 --> 04:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
not selling but it's it's saying that
 
04:28:27.670 --> 04:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
the cannabis itself
 
04:28:31.670 --> 04:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
is not part of this prohibition
 
04:28:33.110 --> 04:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
right the way i read it is the first
 
04:28:35.110 --> 04:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
sentence is really what cannabis is the
 
04:28:41.349 --> 04:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:41.359 --> 04:28:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:28:43.510 --> 04:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:28:45.349 --> 04:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
04:28:47.349 --> 04:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
representative so that's the whole
 
04:28:47.359 --> 04:28:49.189 align:start position:0%
representative so that's the whole
sentence

04:28:49.189 --> 04:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
04:28:50.950 --> 04:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
i mean that whole sentence this whole
 
04:28:50.960 --> 04:28:52.710 align:start position:0%
i mean that whole sentence this whole
subject

04:28:52.710 --> 04:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
subject
 
04:28:55.590 --> 04:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
the whole section is a run-on sentence
 
04:28:56.870 --> 04:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
i think that's why i was looking i was
 
04:28:58.710 --> 04:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
looking for an english major i looked at
 
04:29:00.149 --> 04:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
and i tried to figure out how to rewrite
 
04:29:01.030 --> 04:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
it and i'm like
 
04:29:03.590 --> 04:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to make it two
 
04:29:03.600 --> 04:29:03.830 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to make it two
well sentences

04:29:03.830 --> 04:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
well sentences
 
04:29:05.670 --> 04:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
is two sentences right because the first
 
04:29:07.110 --> 04:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
half i'm looking for the period where's
 
04:29:08.950 --> 04:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
the paper it's it's on line
 
04:29:08.960 --> 04:29:10.149 align:start position:0%
the paper it's it's on line
10.

04:29:10.149 --> 04:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
10.
 
04:29:12.710 --> 04:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
yeah oh i'm i'm oh
 
04:29:14.710 --> 04:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
period i'm looking at line i'm down the
 
04:29:16.469 --> 04:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
bottom here all right what's what
 
04:29:16.479 --> 04:29:25.670 align:start position:0%
bottom here all right what's what
definition

04:29:25.670 --> 04:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:28.710 --> 04:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
there's too many ants in here
 
04:29:30.469 --> 04:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
so remember that was rewritten because
 
04:29:32.870 --> 04:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
we dealt with uh we dealt with the oral
 
04:29:35.830 --> 04:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
so the new sentence in that on line 31
 
04:29:37.670 --> 04:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
reads cannabis products means
 
04:29:39.269 --> 04:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
concentrated cannabis products and
 
04:29:40.469 --> 04:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
cannabis products that have been
 
04:29:42.309 --> 04:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
comprised of cannabis and other
 
04:29:43.750 --> 04:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
ingredients and are intended for
 
04:29:46.550 --> 04:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
personal use such as but not limited to
 
04:29:49.110 --> 04:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
creams ointments tinctures period for
 
04:29:51.349 --> 04:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
the purposes of this paragraph cannabis
 
04:29:53.429 --> 04:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
products shall not include cannabis
 
04:29:56.550 --> 04:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
infused food or drink products included
 
04:29:58.710 --> 04:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to cannabis
 
04:30:00.550 --> 04:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
infused edibles such as candies gummies
 
04:30:01.910 --> 04:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
brownies cookies
 
04:30:03.830 --> 04:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
or cannabis infused alcoholic
 
04:30:06.550 --> 04:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
non-alcoholic beverages alcoholic drinks
 
04:30:08.309 --> 04:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
or beverages of any kind so that was
 
04:30:10.550 --> 04:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
rewritten pat so you have an old copy
 
04:30:12.309 --> 04:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
well yeah that second sentence is a
 
04:30:13.750 --> 04:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
whole new sentence but i still think the
 
04:30:15.750 --> 04:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
first three lines is a wrong sentence
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
but you could check with him yeah he's
 
04:30:18.630 --> 04:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
probably an english major before he was
 
04:30:21.030 --> 04:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
a lawyer is that it that's it that's uh
 
04:30:23.189 --> 04:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
that's unless we have something else
 
04:30:25.510 --> 04:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
no i'm still i want well i guess so hit
 
04:30:26.469 --> 04:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
the scene
 
04:30:28.389 --> 04:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
and i need 20 minutes
 
04:30:30.630 --> 04:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
okay but susan has a one more thing she
 
04:30:32.469 --> 04:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
wants to have another change
 
04:30:35.830 --> 04:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
yes well the same one look at lines 10
 
04:30:39.349 --> 04:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
to 13 and leave out the stuff in between
 
04:30:41.750 --> 04:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis shall not include
 
04:30:44.070 --> 04:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
the weight of any other ingredient
 
04:30:46.229 --> 04:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
combined with cannabis to prepare
 
04:30:48.309 --> 04:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
topical or oral administration's food
 
04:30:50.469 --> 04:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
drink or other product they're talking
 
04:30:52.870 --> 04:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
about the weight of the other product
 
04:30:58.149 --> 04:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:59.510 --> 04:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'm still trying to figure out the word
 
04:31:01.189 --> 04:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
weight means in that entire sentence be
 
04:31:02.950 --> 04:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
honest with you i wasn't sure you know
 
04:31:04.229 --> 04:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
are they talking about how much the eggs
 
04:31:05.910 --> 04:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
wave to make a brownie
 
04:31:09.590 --> 04:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not dr uh murphy is here he
 
04:31:11.429 --> 04:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
may be able to speak to
 
04:31:13.349 --> 04:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
pharmacists who use compounding agents
 
04:31:15.670 --> 04:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
for topicals is that something
 
04:31:17.429 --> 04:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
the weight might be
 
04:31:19.269 --> 04:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
i likewise do not understand what the
 
04:31:20.870 --> 04:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
weight means as it applies to that
 
04:31:22.469 --> 04:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
sentence so
 
04:31:25.349 --> 04:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not a pharmacist but i also say that
 
04:31:28.149 --> 04:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
um that that word is not familiar to me
 
04:31:30.710 --> 04:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
in um any pharmacology that i've ever
 
04:31:30.720 --> 04:31:32.229 align:start position:0%
in um any pharmacology that i've ever
seen

04:31:32.229 --> 04:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
seen
 
04:31:34.149 --> 04:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
i think the intent of that was not to
 
04:31:36.229 --> 04:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
criminalize or have any way hemp
 
04:31:38.070 --> 04:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
products and those kind of things that
 
04:31:40.070 --> 04:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
are could actually get caught up in a
 
04:31:42.070 --> 04:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis definition and it was to
 
04:31:43.990 --> 04:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
exclude those kind of products out from
 
04:31:45.269 --> 04:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
the definition of cannabis for the
 
04:31:48.309 --> 04:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
purpose of the statute
 
04:31:52.229 --> 04:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
yes but it does not exclude
 
04:31:54.790 --> 04:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis can't we just can we just solve
 
04:31:55.750 --> 04:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
this by
 
04:31:59.429 --> 04:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
who drink it or other products we don't
 
04:32:07.830 --> 04:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:09.429 --> 04:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
well can i take a crack at the weight
 
04:32:09.439 --> 04:32:11.750 align:start position:0%
well can i take a crack at the weight
thing

04:32:11.750 --> 04:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:13.830 --> 04:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
let's say let's say it's a
 
04:32:15.750 --> 04:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
chocolate bar that's infused with
 
04:32:15.760 --> 04:32:17.349 align:start position:0%
chocolate bar that's infused with
cannabis

04:32:17.349 --> 04:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
04:32:19.510 --> 04:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
the they they they always talk in terms
 
04:32:22.149 --> 04:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
of grams grams of what measure of weight
 
04:32:23.830 --> 04:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
okay so maybe that's why it's there i'm
 
04:32:25.429 --> 04:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
just guessing that's that's why it's
 
04:32:27.830 --> 04:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
there that's why it's there
 
04:32:27.840 --> 04:32:28.950 align:start position:0%
there that's why it's there
but

04:32:28.950 --> 04:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:32:31.750 --> 04:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis products become something very
 
04:32:31.760 --> 04:32:33.349 align:start position:0%
cannabis products become something very
different

04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:32:35.990 --> 04:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
if you are reading that
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
just if you are not reading that to say
 
04:32:43.110 --> 04:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:45.429 --> 04:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
robson avis
 
04:32:46.950 --> 04:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman this was the
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
intent or goal whether it was achieved
 
04:32:52.149 --> 04:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
or not that's another story but
 
04:32:53.269 --> 04:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
and when you're dealing with any
 
04:32:55.189 --> 04:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
controlled substance it's normally the
 
04:32:57.750 --> 04:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
cutting agent is also included as the
 
04:32:59.349 --> 04:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
gross amount so if you think of like
 
04:32:59.359 --> 04:33:00.389 align:start position:0%
gross amount so if you think of like
cocaine

04:33:00.389 --> 04:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
cocaine
 
04:33:02.229 --> 04:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
and if it's cut with a any type of
 
04:33:03.349 --> 04:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
substance you would count the weight of
 
04:33:04.949 --> 04:33:04.959 align:start position:0%
both the cutting agent and the actual
 
04:33:07.269 --> 04:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
cocaine and that amount is actually what
 
04:33:08.709 --> 04:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
you're in possession of
 
04:33:10.869 --> 04:33:10.879 align:start position:0%
i believe the goal is to not do that
 
04:33:13.269 --> 04:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
with cannabis or cannabis products if
 
04:33:16.230 --> 04:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
you have a chocolate bar that weighs
 
04:33:19.189 --> 04:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
20 grams but it only has 5 grams of thc
 
04:33:21.510 --> 04:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
in it the idea of how much you have is
 
04:33:23.510 --> 04:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to be 5 grams
 
04:33:25.269 --> 04:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
much easier when the product is labeled
 
04:33:27.670 --> 04:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
so we don't want it to be confused
 
04:33:29.590 --> 04:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
that because the total weight of the
 
04:33:31.510 --> 04:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
chocolate bar is not what should be the
 
04:33:32.949 --> 04:33:32.959 align:start position:0%
measuring stick for
 
04:33:34.709 --> 04:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
quantity limits or possession limits
 
04:33:36.230 --> 04:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
that's least the intent and if anyone
 
04:33:38.310 --> 04:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
can help clarify that that would be
 
04:33:40.230 --> 04:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the public and everyone
 
04:33:40.240 --> 04:33:42.869 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the public and everyone
involved

04:33:42.869 --> 04:33:42.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:45.029 --> 04:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
i have a suggestion
 
04:33:47.830 --> 04:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
why don't we leave it the way it is
 
04:33:50.551 --> 04:33:50.561 align:start position:0%
and then let's come up with a definition
 
04:33:52.070 --> 04:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
of white how
 
04:33:54.070 --> 04:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
where it relates to this
 
04:33:55.670 --> 04:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
and make sure that definition is
 
04:33:59.349 --> 04:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
available for the senate
 
04:34:04.310 --> 04:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:06.629 --> 04:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
can you turn your mic on
 
04:34:08.470 --> 04:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
how about taking a crack at using a
 
04:34:11.109 --> 04:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
parenthesis around the word grams after
 
04:34:14.470 --> 04:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:17.990 --> 04:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:18.000 --> 04:34:24.310 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:34:24.310 --> 04:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:26.551 --> 04:34:26.561 align:start position:0%
i still would let's just keep it the way
 
04:34:28.789 --> 04:34:28.799 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:34:33.349 --> 04:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
my problem is the other side of this
 
04:34:37.349 --> 04:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
you're taking that sentence to say that
 
04:34:37.359 --> 04:34:39.349 align:start position:0%
you're taking that sentence to say that
cannabis

04:34:39.349 --> 04:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
04:34:41.990 --> 04:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
does not include food and drinks and
 
04:34:44.230 --> 04:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
we've got cannabis instead of cannabis
 
04:34:47.990 --> 04:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
products everywhere in here
 
04:34:51.109 --> 04:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
and if and it doesn't
 
04:34:54.310 --> 04:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
exclude food and drink cannabis products
 
04:34:55.990 --> 04:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
romans 7 that's
 
04:34:58.629 --> 04:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
line 31 does
 
04:35:06.869 --> 04:35:06.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:06.879 --> 04:35:08.709 align:start position:0%
 
represents

04:35:08.709 --> 04:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
represents
 
04:35:10.949 --> 04:35:10.959 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think that once
 
04:35:13.510 --> 04:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's made into a drink it's now a
 
04:35:15.750 --> 04:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
manufactured product and therefore it
 
04:35:19.429 --> 04:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
would be considered a cannabis product
 
04:35:19.439 --> 04:35:20.629 align:start position:0%
would be considered a cannabis product
under

04:35:20.629 --> 04:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:35:22.709 --> 04:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
on page two lines
 
04:35:25.349 --> 04:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
31 to 33. when it's i think when it's
 
04:35:27.029 --> 04:35:27.039 align:start position:0%
just in it's when you're defining
 
04:35:28.869 --> 04:35:28.879 align:start position:0%
cannabis you're really just talking
 
04:35:31.429 --> 04:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
about it in this raw form and how in the
 
04:35:33.830 --> 04:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
materials you would eventually combined
 
04:35:35.910 --> 04:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
to make a manufacturer product but until
 
04:35:37.590 --> 04:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
it's combined
 
04:35:40.551 --> 04:35:40.561 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a manufactured product yet
 
04:35:42.070 --> 04:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
so i think once it's combined and i
 
04:35:43.109 --> 04:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
think that's what the second sentence
 
04:35:45.670 --> 04:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:47.830 --> 04:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
that makes sense for
 
04:35:49.269 --> 04:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
line seven
 
04:35:51.830 --> 04:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
it does but then we've got a problem
 
04:35:51.840 --> 04:35:52.709 align:start position:0%
it does but then we've got a problem
that

04:35:52.709 --> 04:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
most of the bill says cannabis
 
04:35:55.199 --> 04:35:56.470 align:start position:0%
most of the bill says cannabis
and

04:35:56.470 --> 04:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:36:00.150 --> 04:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
line 31 removes food and drinks from
 
04:36:02.551 --> 04:36:02.561 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about
 
04:36:09.670 --> 04:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:14.150 --> 04:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:14.160 --> 04:36:15.670 align:start position:0%
 
anita

04:36:15.670 --> 04:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
anita
 
04:36:19.109 --> 04:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
04:36:21.990 --> 04:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
would it help
 
04:36:24.470 --> 04:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
if the final phrase
 
04:36:27.670 --> 04:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
of the cannabis definition
 
04:36:29.670 --> 04:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
in the cannabis shall not include
 
04:36:33.990 --> 04:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:36.629 --> 04:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
would it help if the phrase in lines 11
 
04:36:38.709 --> 04:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
to 13
 
04:36:41.109 --> 04:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
or the weight etc
 
04:36:43.590 --> 04:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
got moved out of the definition of
 
04:36:45.349 --> 04:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis and into the definition of
 
04:36:48.709 --> 04:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:48.719 --> 04:36:59.670 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:36:59.670 --> 04:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:01.429 --> 04:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
i'm suggest
 
04:37:03.750 --> 04:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure myself you have to read it
 
04:37:05.830 --> 04:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
several times but
 
04:37:08.709 --> 04:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
isn't it the combination
 
04:37:10.470 --> 04:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
with other
 
04:37:12.709 --> 04:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
cutting agents or what have you
 
04:37:14.709 --> 04:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
that makes weight relevant and isn't
 
04:37:17.830 --> 04:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
that only applicable and relevant in the
 
04:37:22.150 --> 04:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:24.789 --> 04:37:24.799 align:start position:0%
so if mr chair i think
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to paraphrase what
 
04:37:27.510 --> 04:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative abba said but i think the
 
04:37:29.189 --> 04:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
whole point of the weight argument is
 
04:37:30.629 --> 04:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
that there's the weight of the drug and
 
04:37:31.750 --> 04:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
the weight of the
 
04:37:33.029 --> 04:37:33.039 align:start position:0%
of the byproducts so they have the
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
products added to it and the only place
 
04:37:36.230 --> 04:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
it actually comes into play is when
 
04:37:37.670 --> 04:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with
 
04:37:40.230 --> 04:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
quantity right so how much of how much
 
04:37:41.910 --> 04:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
how much marijuana do i have and what's
 
04:37:45.029 --> 04:37:45.039 align:start position:0%
qualified what qualifies as cannabis and
 
04:37:46.789 --> 04:37:46.799 align:start position:0%
i think all this is looking to do is if
 
04:37:48.629 --> 04:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
you take all of these contaminants out
 
04:37:49.750 --> 04:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
how much
 
04:37:51.189 --> 04:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
plant material do you have that you
 
04:37:53.910 --> 04:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
smoke right or how much oil do you have
 
04:37:55.910 --> 04:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
that you you put on your body or use
 
04:37:58.230 --> 04:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
right so i i think we're i actually
 
04:37:59.750 --> 04:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
think it's okay where it is again the
 
04:38:01.269 --> 04:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
only time this argument is going to come
 
04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
into play
 
04:38:02.400 --> 04:38:03.349 align:start position:0%
into play
is

04:38:03.349 --> 04:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:38:06.551 --> 04:38:06.561 align:start position:0%
in the dev is in the prosecution side
 
04:38:09.510 --> 04:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
and what what is you know if you have
 
04:38:11.349 --> 04:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
four ounces of product what is
 
04:38:12.869 --> 04:38:12.879 align:start position:0%
considered actual product what is
 
04:38:15.670 --> 04:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
considered actual byproduct so to speak
 
04:38:18.150 --> 04:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
um or contaminants and so i i would
 
04:38:20.310 --> 04:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
leave it the way it is and leave it for
 
04:38:22.150 --> 04:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
the language and then we can look at on
 
04:38:23.590 --> 04:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice side over in the
 
04:38:25.269 --> 04:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
senate if we really think it's an issue
 
04:38:27.670 --> 04:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
i honestly don't after those i want to
 
04:38:30.150 --> 04:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
leave it the way it is
 
04:38:37.189 --> 04:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:39.109 --> 04:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
so that's the majority
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
the object of the sentence is the other
 
04:38:48.470 --> 04:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:48.480 --> 04:38:50.070 align:start position:0%
 
we're

04:38:50.070 --> 04:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
we're
 
04:38:52.629 --> 04:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
we're take we're saying that
 
04:38:52.639 --> 04:38:53.429 align:start position:0%
we're take we're saying that
the

04:38:53.429 --> 04:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:38:59.750 --> 04:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
other ingredient is not part of cannabis
 
04:38:59.760 --> 04:39:00.949 align:start position:0%
other ingredient is not part of cannabis
in

04:39:00.949 --> 04:39:00.959 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:39:04.390 --> 04:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
section 2. in section 7
 
04:39:08.150 --> 04:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
we are saying that cannabis products
 
04:39:10.551 --> 04:39:10.561 align:start position:0%
do not include
 
04:39:15.269 --> 04:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:18.830 --> 04:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
but cannabis is defined as
 
04:39:21.910 --> 04:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
including all of cannabis
 
04:39:25.750 --> 04:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
except for seeds fiber and and another
 
04:39:27.910 --> 04:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
ingredient which was combined with
 
04:39:27.920 --> 04:39:30.390 align:start position:0%
ingredient which was combined with
cannabis

04:39:30.390 --> 04:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
04:39:33.029 --> 04:39:33.039 align:start position:0%
it's not saying this kind of cannabis
 
04:39:36.230 --> 04:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't count
 
04:39:40.628 --> 04:39:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:44.948 --> 04:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:44.958 --> 04:39:46.550 align:start position:0%
 
rubs

04:39:46.550 --> 04:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
rubs
 
04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
may i please address this for uh
 
04:39:51.190 --> 04:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative elmi are you are
 
04:39:53.670 --> 04:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
if i'm understanding you correctly
 
04:39:53.680 --> 04:39:55.510 align:start position:0%
if i'm understanding you correctly
then

04:39:55.510 --> 04:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:39:57.110 --> 04:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
you would want to remove to prepare
 
04:39:58.788 --> 04:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
topical oral administrations food or
 
04:40:00.830 --> 04:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
drink or any other product from that
 
04:40:03.830 --> 04:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
section and then we don't have
 
04:40:07.110 --> 04:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
the double up of where edibles are
 
04:40:08.948 --> 04:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
uh mentioned
 
04:40:11.590 --> 04:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
or not or taken away is that is as
 
04:40:12.550 --> 04:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
you're saying it's interesting
 
04:40:15.510 --> 04:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
alternative would be to change go
 
04:40:18.310 --> 04:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
through the document have the drafter do
 
04:40:21.030 --> 04:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
it and wherever it is necessary change
 
04:40:24.230 --> 04:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis to cannabis products
 
04:40:26.150 --> 04:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
so that the right definition would be
 
04:40:26.160 --> 04:40:35.270 align:start position:0%
so that the right definition would be
used

04:40:35.270 --> 04:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:36.948 --> 04:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
i can do i can give that to the drafter
 
04:40:38.390 --> 04:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
and just have him to go through and do
 
04:40:39.670 --> 04:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
that just say
 
04:40:41.270 --> 04:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
just look at where the definition where
 
04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis is being used and make the
 
04:40:44.628 --> 04:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
appropriate determination whether it's
 
04:40:46.070 --> 04:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis or cannabis product is
 
04:40:46.080 --> 04:40:47.110 align:start position:0%
cannabis or cannabis product is
appropriate

04:40:47.110 --> 04:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
04:40:47.120 --> 04:40:48.230 align:start position:0%
appropriate
um

04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:50.708 --> 04:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
that's not a big lift i have no problem
 
04:40:53.110 --> 04:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
with that is that okay
 
04:40:57.190 --> 04:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:59.270 --> 04:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
that was our last item
 
04:41:00.868 --> 04:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
that is the last item mr chair if we're
 
04:41:02.310 --> 04:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
okay with this i will send it off to the
 
04:41:03.750 --> 04:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
drafter if people don't mind sticking
 
04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
around about 20 30 minutes we can come
 
04:41:07.030 --> 04:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
back and vote on it
 
04:41:09.190 --> 04:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
right here's what i'd like to have do
 
04:41:11.590 --> 04:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh are we okay if you're okay with this
 
04:41:13.030 --> 04:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
to send it
 
04:41:13.040 --> 04:41:13.830 align:start position:0%
to send it
to

04:41:13.830 --> 04:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:41:20.470 --> 04:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:21.990 --> 04:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
what's your question
 
04:41:24.550 --> 04:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
i thank you mr chairman and i'm not
 
04:41:26.708 --> 04:41:26.718 align:start position:0%
clear in that when we talked about that
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
section six
 
04:41:28.320 --> 04:41:29.510 align:start position:0%
section six
again

04:41:29.510 --> 04:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:41:32.470 --> 04:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
you presented it in one fashion that the
 
04:41:34.150 --> 04:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
profits would be
 
04:41:36.470 --> 04:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
you know to offset costs for the
 
04:41:36.480 --> 04:41:37.670 align:start position:0%
you know to offset costs for the
patients

04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
patients
 
04:41:41.350 --> 04:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
and then last uh period when we spoke
 
04:41:44.788 --> 04:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:46.628 --> 04:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
the atc is being
 
04:41:48.948 --> 04:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
able to be a for-profit what is the
 
04:41:51.670 --> 04:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
legislative intent of this section
 
04:41:52.628 --> 04:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
of this
 
04:41:55.190 --> 04:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
chase thank you so again i did offer it
 
04:41:56.550 --> 04:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
in both directions and it would seem
 
04:41:57.830 --> 04:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
like it was the will of the committee to
 
04:41:59.590 --> 04:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
allow a for-profit model to be able to
 
04:42:01.590 --> 04:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
move forward so it was design it was
 
04:42:05.590 --> 04:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:14.628 --> 04:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:17.110 --> 04:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
and explain
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
well what representative lang first
 
04:42:19.200 --> 04:42:20.628 align:start position:0%
well what representative lang first
presented

04:42:20.628 --> 04:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
presented
 
04:42:22.868 --> 04:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
was the fact that
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
and and let's be clear this is optional
 
04:42:29.190 --> 04:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
this is not mandating that the atc's
 
04:42:31.510 --> 04:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
become cultivators and we're not here to
 
04:42:33.030 --> 04:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
rescue any
 
04:42:34.948 --> 04:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
specific uh
 
04:42:37.830 --> 04:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
business what it is is
 
04:42:40.230 --> 04:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
as as i've heard in testimony their
 
04:42:40.240 --> 04:42:41.270 align:start position:0%
as as i've heard in testimony their
mission

04:42:41.270 --> 04:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
mission
 
04:42:43.910 --> 04:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
is to serve their patients and what
 
04:42:47.110 --> 04:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative lang had explained was
 
04:42:49.030 --> 04:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
if in fact they chose to take on
 
04:42:49.040 --> 04:42:50.390 align:start position:0%
if in fact they chose to take on
cultivation

04:42:50.390 --> 04:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
cultivation
 
04:42:50.400 --> 04:42:51.670 align:start position:0%
cultivation
delivery

04:42:51.670 --> 04:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
delivery
 
04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
at l
 
04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
that those dollars that were generated
 
04:42:56.788 --> 04:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
from that
 
04:42:59.270 --> 04:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
were going to offset cost which seems to
 
04:43:01.270 --> 04:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
be a concern
 
04:43:03.110 --> 04:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
cost for their patients
 
04:43:05.030 --> 04:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
so i guess somewhere i lost something in
 
04:43:06.948 --> 04:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
the translation from where we went from
 
04:43:09.590 --> 04:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
that point of the testimony to
 
04:43:16.310 --> 04:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
unless i'm mistaken but no no i was
 
04:43:20.628 --> 04:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
sitting in the same room here so again i
 
04:43:22.390 --> 04:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
i offered it two ways you know we talked
 
04:43:24.390 --> 04:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
about one taking away the separate
 
04:43:25.990 --> 04:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
entity language and the separate
 
04:43:28.390 --> 04:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
physical location language and allowing
 
04:43:29.910 --> 04:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
them to basically operate under that
 
04:43:31.190 --> 04:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
would say that they could operate under
 
04:43:33.430 --> 04:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
their not-for-profit license and any
 
04:43:35.670 --> 04:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
proceeds they received from sales to the
 
04:43:38.070 --> 04:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
state would have to go back to roll back
 
04:43:38.080 --> 04:43:40.070 align:start position:0%
state would have to go back to roll back
into

04:43:40.070 --> 04:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
the organization for the benefit of the
 
04:43:43.590 --> 04:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
patients however we also heard then we
 
04:43:45.190 --> 04:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
heard testimony about the access of
 
04:43:48.070 --> 04:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
funds and the access of capital and
 
04:43:50.230 --> 04:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
therefore it seemed like i thought we
 
04:43:52.390 --> 04:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
had we had come to a consensus that we
 
04:43:53.990 --> 04:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to leave that
 
04:43:55.910 --> 04:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
language to give them the op the option
 
04:43:57.990 --> 04:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
of opening as a separate entity for a
 
04:43:59.590 --> 04:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
for-profit to be able to access those
 
04:44:01.030 --> 04:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
funds if that's what they needed to do
 
04:44:02.788 --> 04:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
that was my interpretation of what the
 
04:44:04.628 --> 04:44:04.638 align:start position:0%
committee wanted to do was the second
 
04:44:06.708 --> 04:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
one which was leave it so they had if
 
04:44:09.750 --> 04:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
they wanted to open as a for-profit uh
 
04:44:11.510 --> 04:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
sub-entity underneath the not-for-profit
 
04:44:14.390 --> 04:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
they could do that to access capital if
 
04:44:15.910 --> 04:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
i misunderstood and i wrote the
 
04:44:21.110 --> 04:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:24.868 --> 04:44:24.878 align:start position:0%
so this is this was on
 
04:44:27.110 --> 04:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
i find again i think we're on page seven
 
04:44:29.350 --> 04:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
six or seven can you read it
 
04:44:29.360 --> 04:44:30.788 align:start position:0%
six or seven can you read it
yep

04:44:30.788 --> 04:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:44:33.430 --> 04:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
so if you're up on if you're up on page
 
04:44:33.440 --> 04:44:34.550 align:start position:0%
so if you're up on if you're up on page
um

04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:36.470 --> 04:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
seven and we're looking at the the
 
04:44:39.430 --> 04:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
number six there it says it starts off
 
04:44:41.990 --> 04:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
with an an alternative treatment center
 
04:44:43.350 --> 04:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
that's what the line starts on the
 
04:44:44.470 --> 04:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
current bill
 
04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
on amendment
 
04:44:51.030 --> 04:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
it will say notwithstanding rsa 126-x
 
04:44:52.948 --> 04:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
and i'll turn to the treatment center
 
04:44:54.550 --> 04:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
register operate
 
04:44:57.670 --> 04:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
pursuant to rsa 126x may follow an
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
application to obtain a separate
 
04:45:01.910 --> 04:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
registration to operate as a for-profit
 
04:45:04.310 --> 04:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis cultivation cannabis product
 
04:45:06.230 --> 04:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturing or cannabis transporter
 
04:45:07.990 --> 04:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
and the rest is all the same
 
04:45:09.910 --> 04:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
so we just added the the not
 
04:45:12.550 --> 04:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
withstanding rsa 126x and then for
 
04:45:13.990 --> 04:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
profit to give them the option if they
 
04:45:15.190 --> 04:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
04:45:17.110 --> 04:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
how's that
 
04:45:20.070 --> 04:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:21.510 --> 04:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
no you can't see me
 
04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
let me yeah
 
04:45:26.948 --> 04:45:26.958 align:start position:0%
that's fine i just wanted to find as to
 
04:45:28.788 --> 04:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
where we were going with this
 
04:45:31.430 --> 04:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
okay okay representative
 
04:45:34.708 --> 04:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
i i still feel the last uh
 
04:45:37.270 --> 04:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
seven words need to be removed because
 
04:45:38.708 --> 04:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
one of their
 
04:45:41.270 --> 04:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
points was that it would take a lot to
 
04:45:43.990 --> 04:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
do another physical location
 
04:45:47.430 --> 04:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
so i believe that should come out
 
04:45:49.270 --> 04:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
my apologies i did strike that from the
 
04:45:50.788 --> 04:45:50.798 align:start position:0%
amendment after our conversation i just
 
04:45:52.150 --> 04:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
forgot that when we were talking about i
 
04:45:53.590 --> 04:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
struck there still leaves it as a
 
04:45:57.990 --> 04:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:58.000 --> 04:45:58.948 align:start position:0%
 
good

04:45:58.948 --> 04:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:46:00.948 --> 04:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
04:46:00.958 --> 04:46:02.150 align:start position:0%
anything else
then

04:46:02.150 --> 04:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:46:04.230 --> 04:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
are we all in agreement with this
 
04:46:04.240 --> 04:46:06.550 align:start position:0%
are we all in agreement with this
amendment

04:46:06.550 --> 04:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:46:09.190 --> 04:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
then what we'll do is you can hit the
 
04:46:11.190 --> 04:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
sandbox i already did
 
04:46:14.470 --> 04:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
it take 20 minutes and that 20 minutes
 
04:46:18.070 --> 04:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:21.270 --> 04:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
and so if the amendment comes back the
 
04:46:24.470 --> 04:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:26.708 --> 04:46:26.718 align:start position:0%
expect it to come back
 
04:46:36.470 --> 04:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:38.230 --> 04:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
don't you think we ought to caucus after
 
04:46:42.150 --> 04:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
we have it in print oh yeah
 
04:46:44.070 --> 04:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
so it's after that we get the printed
 
04:46:46.788 --> 04:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
version that we'll caulk us
 
04:46:48.948 --> 04:46:48.958 align:start position:0%

04:46:50.788 --> 04:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
chair we'll come back in here for
 
04:46:52.708 --> 04:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
maybe other people don't agree with me
 
04:46:54.868 --> 04:46:54.878 align:start position:0%
come back here for 310 if i have the
 
04:46:56.310 --> 04:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
amendment i'll hand out the amendment
 
04:46:58.070 --> 04:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
then we can go right into caucus

05:43:18.868 --> 05:43:18.878 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:43:18.878 --> 05:43:20.150 align:start position:0%
we
changed

05:43:20.150 --> 05:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
changed
 
05:43:21.670 --> 05:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
the section dealing with health and
 
05:43:23.750 --> 05:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
safety rules to add the
 
05:43:25.750 --> 05:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
section about contaminants
 
05:43:27.670 --> 05:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
we added the section about requirements
 
05:43:29.430 --> 05:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
for testing to say that testing will be
 
05:43:31.990 --> 05:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
of all kind of cannabis products and for
 
05:43:33.990 --> 05:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
potency and contaminants
 
05:43:35.990 --> 05:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
why don't we just show where the changes
 
05:43:39.110 --> 05:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
are sure all right uh so
 
05:43:41.270 --> 05:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
page one i got it because the numbers
 
05:43:45.270 --> 05:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
are different now so page one line uh
 
05:43:45.280 --> 05:43:46.788 align:start position:0%
are different now so page one line uh
sixteen

05:43:46.788 --> 05:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
sixteen
 
05:43:48.310 --> 05:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
so that was at representative tucker's
 
05:43:51.910 --> 05:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:58.390 --> 05:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:01.030 --> 05:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh that was page six well let me find it
 
05:44:02.150 --> 05:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's the same page
 
05:44:02.160 --> 05:44:09.190 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's the same page
number

05:44:09.190 --> 05:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:14.150 --> 05:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:15.430 --> 05:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
right that was right that was the
 
05:44:17.030 --> 05:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
definition i read to everybody it's
 
05:44:22.070 --> 05:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:22.080 --> 05:44:23.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:44:23.670 --> 05:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:26.470 --> 05:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
the next one was i believe
 
05:44:26.480 --> 05:44:27.510 align:start position:0%
the next one was i believe
under

05:44:27.510 --> 05:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
under
 
05:44:38.708 --> 05:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:40.470 --> 05:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
you're much faster than i am yes page
 
05:44:42.070 --> 05:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
six line nine
 
05:44:43.990 --> 05:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
under section seven health and safety
 
05:44:46.628 --> 05:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
rules it now includes the words uh
 
05:44:50.788 --> 05:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:54.390 --> 05:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
and then on that same page line 19.
 
05:44:56.230 --> 05:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
i change that line to say requirements
 
05:44:57.750 --> 05:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
for all testing
 
05:44:59.110 --> 05:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
requirements for the testing of all
 
05:45:00.628 --> 05:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
cannabis products for potency and
 
05:45:00.638 --> 05:45:13.110 align:start position:0%
cannabis products for potency and
contaminants

05:45:13.110 --> 05:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:15.190 --> 05:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
page 7 line 10 that's a not withstanding
 
05:45:16.948 --> 05:45:16.958 align:start position:0%
language we added and we took out away
 
05:45:21.030 --> 05:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:29.030 --> 05:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:31.670 --> 05:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:34.070 --> 05:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
one more section i sent him a note on
 
05:45:37.190 --> 05:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
to deal with uh the sale of cannabis
 
05:45:49.430 --> 05:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:58.230 --> 05:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:00.708 --> 05:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to find the one where it says
 
05:46:03.350 --> 05:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
commissioners for selling
 
05:46:04.948 --> 05:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
that line there i had a look at it to
 
05:46:06.310 --> 05:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
make sure we didn't have a problem with
 
05:46:09.190 --> 05:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis versus cannabis products
 
05:46:13.590 --> 05:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:19.030 --> 05:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:21.350 --> 05:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
if anybody sees a section that says it
 
05:46:23.190 --> 05:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
talks about the sale
 
05:46:28.628 --> 05:46:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:33.670 --> 05:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:35.350 --> 05:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
i'll compare it to the old language to
 
05:46:35.360 --> 05:46:39.830 align:start position:0%
i'll compare it to the old language to
see

05:46:39.830 --> 05:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:41.430 --> 05:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so they changed it and added and
 
05:46:42.948 --> 05:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
cannabis products in there to make sure
 
05:46:42.958 --> 05:46:43.830 align:start position:0%
cannabis products in there to make sure
that

05:46:43.830 --> 05:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:46:48.070 --> 05:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:50.548 --> 05:46:50.558 align:start position:0%
so line if you look at line 10
 
05:46:54.548 --> 05:46:54.558 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry line um it's line 18
 
05:46:56.470 --> 05:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
it now says it'll do the commission to
 
05:46:58.070 --> 05:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
buy and have in his possession cannabis
 
05:47:01.270 --> 05:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
and cannabis products as defined by
 
05:47:02.708 --> 05:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
and it refers back to the chapter to
 
05:47:17.750 --> 05:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:19.510 --> 05:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
so it also talks about
 
05:47:21.430 --> 05:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
um so again if you
 
05:47:23.270 --> 05:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
read this section
 
05:47:24.548 --> 05:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
it says it shall be the duty of the
 
05:47:26.070 --> 05:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
commission to buy and have in its
 
05:47:27.590 --> 05:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
possession cannabis and cannabis prox is
 
05:47:28.708 --> 05:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
defined in
 
05:47:31.270 --> 05:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
318 f1 for the sale and the manner
 
05:47:34.310 --> 05:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
described in 318f and to sell cannabis
 
05:47:34.320 --> 05:47:36.548 align:start position:0%
described in 318f and to sell cannabis
therapeutic

05:47:36.548 --> 05:47:36.558 align:start position:0%
therapeutic
 
05:47:36.558 --> 05:47:37.830 align:start position:0%
therapeutic
purposes

05:47:37.830 --> 05:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
05:47:40.070 --> 05:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
for the authorizat as authorized under
 
05:47:42.788 --> 05:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
126x so that gives them the
 
05:47:44.788 --> 05:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
the ability to sell cannabis and
 
05:47:46.470 --> 05:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis products under under this
 
05:47:48.470 --> 05:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
definition as well as for the purposes
 
05:47:50.390 --> 05:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
of medical that met the therapeutic
 
05:47:52.230 --> 05:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis as well
 
05:47:52.240 --> 05:47:53.830 align:start position:0%
cannabis as well
yes

05:47:53.830 --> 05:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:47:56.628 --> 05:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
so i seem to have lost track of where it
 
05:47:58.628 --> 05:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
says the cannabis has to be raised in
 
05:48:02.310 --> 05:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:03.590 --> 05:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry your question is where does it
 
05:48:05.990 --> 05:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
say that yeah i gotta go find that up
 
05:48:07.830 --> 05:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
not sure do you remember is it under
 
05:48:19.670 --> 05:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:21.830 --> 05:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative abbas
 
05:48:22.830 --> 05:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
05:48:25.670 --> 05:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
chairman so the way it came at least the
 
05:48:26.628 --> 05:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
way it
 
05:48:28.708 --> 05:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
initially passed the house
 
05:48:30.708 --> 05:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
it didn't specifically say
 
05:48:30.718 --> 05:48:31.510 align:start position:0%
it didn't specifically say
that

05:48:31.510 --> 05:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:48:33.350 --> 05:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
the cannabis would have to be grown in
 
05:48:34.628 --> 05:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:48:37.030 --> 05:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
but any other state that i'm aware of
 
05:48:39.510 --> 05:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
that allows for cultivation
 
05:48:41.110 --> 05:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
those states are prohibited from selling
 
05:48:43.430 --> 05:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
it out of state so for example maine
 
05:48:45.270 --> 05:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
a main cultivator it's not that new
 
05:48:47.270 --> 05:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire's law is the problem a main
 
05:48:49.590 --> 05:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
cultivator maine's law will not let them
 
05:48:51.430 --> 05:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
sell it out of state
 
05:48:53.670 --> 05:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
so the way the bill was drafted and i
 
05:48:55.270 --> 05:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
tried to do this as best as i could with
 
05:48:58.070 --> 05:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
every provision that we came across was
 
05:48:58.080 --> 05:48:58.948 align:start position:0%
every provision that we came across was
to

05:48:58.948 --> 05:48:58.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:49:00.708 --> 05:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
draft it in a way that if the federal
 
05:49:03.030 --> 05:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
prohibition was not there
 
05:49:05.350 --> 05:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
that we would not have to go through
 
05:49:06.948 --> 05:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
this whole process and basically rewrite
 
05:49:08.070 --> 05:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
05:49:09.830 --> 05:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
legislation so i don't believe anywhere
 
05:49:11.430 --> 05:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
in the bill it specifically says it has
 
05:49:13.510 --> 05:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
to be grown in new hampshire but weren't
 
05:49:16.150 --> 05:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
you the person who testified that
 
05:49:20.070 --> 05:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
we had a brand as an agricultural state
 
05:49:21.510 --> 05:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
and that
 
05:49:23.750 --> 05:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
this was an important aspect of this
 
05:49:26.070 --> 05:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
bill well i think for when i meant
 
05:49:28.230 --> 05:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
branding purposes like an atc for
 
05:49:29.510 --> 05:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
example they could
 
05:49:31.030 --> 05:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
sell their brand to the state and i
 
05:49:32.390 --> 05:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
would i would promote that type of
 
05:49:32.400 --> 05:49:33.510 align:start position:0%
would i would promote that type of
policy

05:49:33.510 --> 05:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
policy
 
05:49:35.670 --> 05:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
any cultivator they can have market
 
05:49:36.868 --> 05:49:36.878 align:start position:0%
their brand
 
05:49:39.110 --> 05:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
but if the federal prohibition were to
 
05:49:39.120 --> 05:49:39.910 align:start position:0%
but if the federal prohibition were to
be

05:49:39.910 --> 05:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:49:39.920 --> 05:49:41.430 align:start position:0%
be
abolished

05:49:41.430 --> 05:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
abolished
 
05:49:44.230 --> 05:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that a law restricting the
 
05:49:45.670 --> 05:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
purchase of cannabis in the state of new
 
05:49:47.190 --> 05:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire would hold up under the
 
05:49:49.430 --> 05:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
commerce clause i'm i'm just
 
05:49:50.708 --> 05:49:50.718 align:start position:0%
not going either way with that i think
 
05:49:51.990 --> 05:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's it's questionable whether it
 
05:49:52.000 --> 05:49:53.030 align:start position:0%
that's it's questionable whether it
would

05:49:53.030 --> 05:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:49:55.350 --> 05:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
actually survive the scrutiny
 
05:49:57.510 --> 05:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
so we kind of wrote it both ways that
 
05:50:00.548 --> 05:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to be
 
05:50:02.470 --> 05:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
it's forward thinking
 
05:50:04.150 --> 05:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
but any other product you can't for
 
05:50:05.830 --> 05:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
example i mean
 
05:50:08.230 --> 05:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
wood lumber you can't say you only can
 
05:50:10.708 --> 05:50:10.718 align:start position:0%
build houses using lumber from trees you
 
05:50:10.718 --> 05:50:11.750 align:start position:0%
build houses using lumber from trees you
know

05:50:11.750 --> 05:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:50:13.590 --> 05:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
grown in new hampshire
 
05:50:15.110 --> 05:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't again that wouldn't that
 
05:50:17.750 --> 05:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't work
 
05:50:20.470 --> 05:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
so if i just declared daryl what you
 
05:50:22.708 --> 05:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
said was there's no specific
 
05:50:25.270 --> 05:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh prohibition from out of state however
 
05:50:27.190 --> 05:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
we'd be bound by other rules and laws
 
05:50:28.548 --> 05:50:28.558 align:start position:0%
that would prohibit us from growing out
 
05:50:30.470 --> 05:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
of state or selling out of state based
 
05:50:32.150 --> 05:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
on federal law but if that federal law
 
05:50:34.868 --> 05:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
goes away then we could so because of
 
05:50:36.070 --> 05:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
that where
 
05:50:37.830 --> 05:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
by its very nature we have to grow
 
05:50:39.750 --> 05:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
within the state
 
05:50:41.670 --> 05:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
yes and the same would go for selling if
 
05:50:43.830 --> 05:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
a cultivator in new hampshire wanted to
 
05:50:45.270 --> 05:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
sell to maine
 
05:50:46.868 --> 05:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
maine's the problem it would be maine's
 
05:50:48.390 --> 05:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
law would not permit
 
05:50:51.030 --> 05:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
a retailer and they would i can imagine
 
05:50:52.788 --> 05:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
either face a penalty or lose their
 
05:50:52.798 --> 05:50:57.430 align:start position:0%
either face a penalty or lose their
license

05:50:57.430 --> 05:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:57.440 --> 05:50:59.110 align:start position:0%
 
well

05:50:59.110 --> 05:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:51:00.548 --> 05:51:00.558 align:start position:0%
i think when it comes to any type of
 
05:51:03.110 --> 05:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis we're ignoring federal law
 
05:51:03.120 --> 05:51:04.548 align:start position:0%
cannabis we're ignoring federal law
medical

05:51:04.548 --> 05:51:04.558 align:start position:0%
medical
 
05:51:04.558 --> 05:51:06.150 align:start position:0%
medical
retail

05:51:06.150 --> 05:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
retail
 
05:51:08.150 --> 05:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
you name it so
 
05:51:09.750 --> 05:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's when this was drafted it was
 
05:51:11.990 --> 05:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
almost within complete
 
05:51:14.868 --> 05:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
i ignored federal law as much as
 
05:51:20.470 --> 05:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:20.480 --> 05:51:21.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:51:21.910 --> 05:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:51:24.628 --> 05:51:24.638 align:start position:0%
representative romney yeah so brand
 
05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
means i mean also means there's
 
05:51:28.230 --> 05:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
different strains
 
05:51:30.868 --> 05:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
and one grower may have the specialty
 
05:51:32.948 --> 05:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
strain the bigger the company is they
 
05:51:34.788 --> 05:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
have to hire botanists
 
05:51:37.270 --> 05:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
to engineer their plants to produce more
 
05:51:40.390 --> 05:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
thc or different whatever so
 
05:51:42.788 --> 05:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
it's they have there are brands that are
 
05:51:44.948 --> 05:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
unique to a grower
 
05:51:49.350 --> 05:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:51.030 --> 05:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
see it's
 
05:51:53.590 --> 05:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
it was implied if not directly said that
 
05:51:55.830 --> 05:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
this was going to be a boon to new
 
05:51:55.840 --> 05:51:56.948 align:start position:0%
this was going to be a boon to new
hampshire

05:51:56.948 --> 05:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:51:59.830 --> 05:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
agriculture maybe so maybe not but
 
05:52:01.750 --> 05:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the bill to prevent
 
05:52:03.590 --> 05:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh local farmers for getting into
 
05:52:05.110 --> 05:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
business and that's the way it should be
 
05:52:06.948 --> 05:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
it's like it's wide open as to who can
 
05:52:08.788 --> 05:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
get a license
 
05:52:10.788 --> 05:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
so if it's a farmer who wants to do it
 
05:52:11.910 --> 05:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
they can do it but they're going to
 
05:52:13.590 --> 05:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
quickly find that if they grow it
 
05:52:16.470 --> 05:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
outside for once for a short season it's
 
05:52:18.150 --> 05:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
probably not the best thing
 
05:52:19.750 --> 05:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
and plus they have all the contaminated
 
05:52:19.760 --> 05:52:20.868 align:start position:0%
and plus they have all the contaminated
problems

05:52:20.868 --> 05:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
problems
 
05:52:23.510 --> 05:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
all the pesticide problems outdoors it's
 
05:52:25.910 --> 05:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
more than than they were all pests
 
05:52:27.990 --> 05:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
little little bugs you know
 
05:52:31.430 --> 05:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
that that ruin your your uh lettuce or
 
05:52:33.750 --> 05:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
whatever else you grow outside that's
 
05:52:35.590 --> 05:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
why people do it inside
 
05:52:38.070 --> 05:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:39.270 --> 05:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:52:40.390 --> 05:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
so like
 
05:52:41.910 --> 05:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
represent tucker i think again i think
 
05:52:43.350 --> 05:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
the idea was new hampshire is an
 
05:52:44.948 --> 05:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
agricultural state and this could be an
 
05:52:46.310 --> 05:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
option for our farmers who are
 
05:52:47.990 --> 05:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
struggling to be able to have a solution
 
05:52:49.830 --> 05:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
and due to the federal current federal
 
05:52:51.830 --> 05:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
law they can't do it to state transport
 
05:52:54.390 --> 05:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
anyway so by opening this business up it
 
05:52:56.070 --> 05:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
allows farmers to potentially get into
 
05:53:02.310 --> 05:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:03.750 --> 05:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
the other thank you mr chairman the
 
05:53:05.030 --> 05:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
other conversation that we had around
 
05:53:06.868 --> 05:53:06.878 align:start position:0%
branding had to do with the with the
 
05:53:08.390 --> 05:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
liquor commission
 
05:53:11.430 --> 05:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
wanting to brand separately from the
 
05:53:13.430 --> 05:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol commission from from
 
05:53:21.910 --> 05:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:21.920 --> 05:53:25.110 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:53:25.110 --> 05:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:26.230 --> 05:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:53:29.030 --> 05:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm trying to get my
 
05:53:32.390 --> 05:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
mind around the cannabis products
 
05:53:32.400 --> 05:53:33.430 align:start position:0%
mind around the cannabis products
and

05:53:33.430 --> 05:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:53:35.830 --> 05:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
you've made the change
 
05:53:39.270 --> 05:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:39.280 --> 05:53:40.230 align:start position:0%
 
where

05:53:40.230 --> 05:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:53:42.708 --> 05:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
this this is just a small point but it
 
05:53:45.190 --> 05:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
may be a drafting error for the purpose
 
05:53:47.350 --> 05:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
of this paragraph cannabis products
 
05:53:48.868 --> 05:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
shall not include
 
05:53:50.628 --> 05:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
a bunch of things
 
05:53:52.150 --> 05:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
the paragraph
 
05:53:54.470 --> 05:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
this is a definition that
 
05:53:56.948 --> 05:53:56.958 align:start position:0%
starts out in this chapter
 
05:53:58.230 --> 05:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
which is the whole
 
05:54:00.708 --> 05:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
chapter regulation of cannabis but for
 
05:54:02.470 --> 05:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
some reason you've got this clause in
 
05:54:02.480 --> 05:54:03.270 align:start position:0%
some reason you've got this clause in
there

05:54:03.270 --> 05:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:54:05.990 --> 05:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
that limits the cannabis products to
 
05:54:07.510 --> 05:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
this paragraph
 
05:54:09.190 --> 05:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
we can come back to that
 
05:54:12.708 --> 05:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:14.548 --> 05:54:14.558 align:start position:0%
let's let's take that
 
05:54:17.430 --> 05:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh definition of cannabis products
 
05:54:19.910 --> 05:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
which shall not include
 
05:54:22.150 --> 05:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
food or drink products
 
05:54:25.510 --> 05:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
and then go over into the into the law
 
05:54:25.520 --> 05:54:26.788 align:start position:0%
and then go over into the into the law
and

05:54:26.788 --> 05:54:26.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:54:28.788 --> 05:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
if you go to page six this is just an
 
05:54:28.798 --> 05:54:30.548 align:start position:0%
if you go to page six this is just an
example

05:54:30.548 --> 05:54:30.558 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:54:32.470 --> 05:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh in the middle
 
05:54:34.470 --> 05:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
line 14
 
05:54:36.788 --> 05:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
our labeling requirements for cannabis
 
05:54:36.798 --> 05:54:39.030 align:start position:0%
our labeling requirements for cannabis
products

05:54:39.030 --> 05:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
products
 
05:54:40.948 --> 05:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
mandating this requirements for
 
05:54:43.350 --> 05:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
packaging and so forth well cannabis
 
05:54:48.628 --> 05:54:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:51.430 --> 05:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
what's excluded by that definition
 
05:54:53.750 --> 05:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
so is there going to be no labeling on
 
05:54:53.760 --> 05:54:54.788 align:start position:0%
so is there going to be no labeling on
the

05:54:54.788 --> 05:54:54.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:54:57.030 --> 05:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
those products that
 
05:54:58.470 --> 05:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission is going to be
 
05:55:00.070 --> 05:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
authorized evidence
 
05:55:02.070 --> 05:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
shelves for the
 
05:55:07.670 --> 05:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:09.270 --> 05:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
if i mean
 
05:55:11.910 --> 05:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
so again i i the therapeutic products
 
05:55:13.030 --> 05:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
are going to be
 
05:55:15.750 --> 05:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
are going to be controlled by the 126x
 
05:55:17.350 --> 05:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
statute that's right the idea that
 
05:55:19.190 --> 05:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
you're totally separated they'll still
 
05:55:20.948 --> 05:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
yeah they'll still they'll still be
 
05:55:22.948 --> 05:55:22.958 align:start position:0%
labeled pursuant to that
 
05:55:24.868 --> 05:55:24.878 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
05:55:24.878 --> 05:55:25.910 align:start position:0%
that's okay
okay

05:55:25.910 --> 05:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:55:25.920 --> 05:55:28.708 align:start position:0%
okay

05:55:28.708 --> 05:55:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:30.230 --> 05:55:30.240 align:start position:0%

the um
 
05:55:43.350 --> 05:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
the definition was what we said it was
 
05:55:45.430 --> 05:55:45.440 align:start position:0%

you know big things have been changed
 
06:01:52.070 --> 06:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
like taking the banks out
 
06:01:53.750 --> 06:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
moving to
 
06:01:58.070 --> 06:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
a non-numerical approach to cultivators
 
06:02:00.788 --> 06:02:00.798 align:start position:0%

06:08:31.990 --> 06:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
just one final comment uh on
 
06:08:33.430 --> 06:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
what it means
 
06:08:33.440 --> 06:08:34.788 align:start position:0%
what it means
for

06:08:34.788 --> 06:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:08:36.948 --> 06:08:36.958 align:start position:0%

06:08:36.958 --> 06:08:38.788 align:start position:0%

06:08:38.788 --> 06:08:38.798 align:start position:0%
raised
 
06:08:41.350 --> 06:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
so could you just briefly
 
06:08:43.430 --> 06:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
bring us up to date on that yes mr chair
 
06:08:44.948 --> 06:08:44.958 align:start position:0%
just as a clarification mr chair we're
 
06:08:45.910 --> 06:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
gonna have another report by
 
06:08:46.868 --> 06:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
representative ames their
 
06:08:48.548 --> 06:08:48.558 align:start position:0%
recommendations will be interim study
 
06:08:49.830 --> 06:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
and this is going on the regular
 
06:08:51.910 --> 06:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
calendar yes thank you
 
06:08:53.910 --> 06:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
um so again we had the financial
 
06:08:56.948 --> 06:08:56.958 align:start position:0%
discussion about this the the using the
 
06:08:59.430 --> 06:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
numbers coming from the uh liquor
 
06:09:02.230 --> 06:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
commission on a 250 million dollar gross
 
06:09:05.110 --> 06:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
revenue this and that assumed all
 
06:09:05.120 --> 06:09:06.070 align:start position:0%
revenue this and that assumed all
products

06:09:06.070 --> 06:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
products
 
06:09:07.830 --> 06:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
there would be about 50 million dollars
 
06:09:09.590 --> 06:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
in gross profit that would become to the
 
06:09:11.910 --> 06:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
state however we know that about 40 of
 
06:09:14.070 --> 06:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
that number was the edible language that
 
06:09:16.150 --> 06:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
we took out of the bill that so it's not
 
06:09:19.510 --> 06:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
in the bill um which means that our our
 
06:09:21.750 --> 06:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
gross revenues for the state are around
 
06:09:23.830 --> 06:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
30 million dollars
 
06:09:25.190 --> 06:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
i think that's all we really know we
 
06:09:26.788 --> 06:09:26.798 align:start position:0%
know that the one thing we also know is
 
06:09:28.070 --> 06:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
that that's going to be a rolling number
 
06:09:29.430 --> 06:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's assuming they're up to 100
 
06:09:31.030 --> 06:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
percent we wouldn't expect to see that
 
06:09:32.948 --> 06:09:32.958 align:start position:0%
number until the end of the third year
 
06:09:34.628 --> 06:09:34.638 align:start position:0%
that numbers start becoming true first
 
06:09:35.830 --> 06:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
year it's going to be about 10 million
 
06:09:37.510 --> 06:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
dollars second year 20 million dollars
 
06:09:40.628 --> 06:09:40.638 align:start position:0%
30 or 30 million dollars
